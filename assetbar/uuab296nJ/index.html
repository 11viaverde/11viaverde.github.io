      Hash browns in the US are "peelings" of potatoes that are made into a patty-like shape and fried in a pan.  The goal is to keep them in the patty shape so that the middle stays soft, and the outside crunchy.

      Oookay, "Midwest" is pretty vague, I'm in Wisconsin (go Badgers/Packers).  "Fried potatoes" are all sliced up with onions, and also called "cottage fries," at least by my known kitchen associates.  And despite McDuck's co-opting the word "hashbrown" for their hockey pucks, "hash" means shredded.

In my slave years at a greasy Country Kitchen, I fried shredded tots on the grill for "hashbrowns". A kindly old German grandmother would come in and grind potatoes into a slurry that we browned on the grill, then fried in hot fat as "potato pancakes".  I only ate fried cheese, so I cannot comment on their respective qualities.

      Deep Friend Pizza is a Pizza that you order from a reputable neighborhood Pizzeria, not a chain or a greasy joint, but a good honest restaurant.  This Pizza comes to your door in a reasonable amount of time, and the Pizzaguy smiles as he hands it to you.  You share the Pizza with a close friend, or loved one, perhaps while quietly holding hands, depending on the nature of your relationship.  Because the pizza was perfectly sized for two, there are no leftovers, and you are both satisfied.  It is a good Pizza, made by honest men. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, you are both stoned.

      When we go out for Mexican, we always get fried ice-cream.  The ice-cream has to be VERY cold before it goes in the fryer;  it's coated in cookie crumbs, then it's just a quick dip in the oil to get that crackly, delicious glaze on top. <br/>

I've also had it at Japanese restaurants, where they coat green tea or red bean ice-cream in sweet tempura batter. :P

      I would attempt to usurp your power and government by staging a coup or revolution of sorts (it depends on the situation, really), and hastily install a puppet government to cover up for the fact that I am in fact a fascist dictator, complete with gold toilets and harems and Eagle's Nests and the lot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then, with the very fabric of our society splintered and worn into sharp dust from years of infighting, propaganda, persecution, uprisings and the genocide of the supposedly inhuman FirstPosters whom I had scapegoated for all our economic ruin, the youth will discover a book of prophecy thought long lost to the years.  Hidden away in the dusty attic of an old and wise FirstPoster who was dragged away to the death pits in the first weeks of the Inquisition, the children of Assetbaria discover a prophecy of One who will save their horrid and forsaken land. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Inside, a picture; drawn as though carved into the page, colored as though by an old and controlling hand, worn as though by the avatar of time itself - a picture of the one they had all remembered as "Margargaret". <br/> 
 <br/> 
"But surely she is dead?" cried young Pumjesticles.  "Have they not told us she was run through in the Second War of Koodge in 2009?  Have they told us wrongly?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Perhaps what we have been taught is not as certain as they claim," said the stern-eyed Pogo III. "Perhaps we need to find new answers to believe in.  And, perhaps with it, a new hero will rise from her ashes." <br/> 
 <br/> 
And so begins a new chapter in the annals of Assetbaria....

Naw I just wanted to say (or even type) 'tumescence', it is a fine word. You can have one all you like. And I know what you mean, People Being Nice to Each Other, in the Internet and in General, is quite delightful really.

      Now hold, on, a picture of oneself can never ever be an avatar, which is by definition "The incarnation of a Hindu deity, especially Vishnu, in human or animal form. An embodiment, as of a quality or concept; an archetype."  It's you.  So, it has to be an icon.  (Although we are accepting both "avicon" and "avataricon" because we are not cocks to strangers.)

      Now, now, now.  We should all be aware that the word "Avatar" has also been used since the mid-80s to signify visual representations (characters/photos/etc) that subtitute for the person in an online context (i.e. on message boards or in games).  While this meaning of the word is based on the original Hindu term, it is a new and valid definition which has been generally accepted for a decade at least. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Remember, the original primary definition of an "icon" is a religious representation/image of a Deity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I apologize if this was being a dick about terms.  I'm sorry.

      Well hell, one more try at this term-dickishness.  How about we agree to use the Computer Desktop Encyclopedia, hey?  Kids?  More pizza?  Look, here are the definitions from the PC Magazine website.  What better authority, right? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Definition of: avatar  <br/> 
 <br/> 
A graphic identity you either select from a group of choices or create on your own to represent yourself to the other party in a chat, instant messaging (IM) or multiplayer gaming session. An avatar is a caricature, not a realistic photo and can be a simple image or a bizarre fantasy figure. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Avatar is a Sanskrit word that means the incarnation of a god on earth, and this usage of the term came from the gaming and 3D chat worlds. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Definition of: icon  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In a graphical user interface (GUI), a small, pictorial, on-screen representation of an object, such as a document, program, folder or disk drive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Source: https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/ <br/> 
 <br/> 
So class, it looks like an avatar can be static and could appear as a thumbnail, althought I still like "icon" for that.  But I will yeild "icon" to true computer stuff, and join the avatar camp.  However, it is illogical to be one's own avatar unless we call it a "self-atar" or something.  Discuss while I go to the principal's office with spiny -- I told you to leave earmorekix alone! <br/>

      Is it possible to be a dick about sources while being a dick about terms? <br/> 
The earliest use of Avatar in a digital context that I've seen is in Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson.  His use fit the Sanskrit definition of a god (the real person) being incarnated in a world, in this case virtual.  I'm sure his choice of the word avatar was based on the themes of the book, where icon would not have fit as well.  This makes me ask 3 questions in trying to get a grip on avatar/icon: <br/> 
1.  Anyone seen an earlier use of avatar? <br/> 
2.  Anyone know a source for icon on the internet? <br/> 
3.  Would the line between avatar and icon perhaps be movement or control?  An icon is just a still painting, an avatar is a functional incarnation.  So for instance a character in WOW would be an avatar, while a picture by your name here would be an icon. Or does the act of changing your representative picture make that space an avatar as opposed to always having the same picture as an icon? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personally, I just like the word avatar better.  It looks good written out, it sounds good being spoken. However, I am a dick about terms, particularly with myself. <br/>

No, I am just someone who posts when the whim strikes. However, I read everyone else's comments most days, and get great enjoyment from them (thank you all).  I usually don't see the new comics until well after they are posted, so you are unlikely to see me near the top of the comment trees.  That is my definition within this space at any rate.  Further definition requires...well, further space.   <br/>

      First, sorry for the long delay on the first response.  I only just realized I had an Inbox that made checking on these responses easier. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm glad to hear you are reading Snow Crash.  Stephenson is one of my favorite writers.  Snow Crash is one of his earlier published works, when he was still really getting a grip on his writing style.  His later works just get better from there.  My favorite (to date) is probably the System of Worlds series, but as my name indicates I have a penchant for history.  However, the concepts in Snow Crash still make me re-read it on a regular basis.  Diamond Age too, although neither are his greatest display of writing skill.  I have to enjoy them now before Hollywood ruins them with movie versions someday. <br/> 
I hope you enjoy the read.

      Yes, using Inbox takes a little getting used to.  I open it, then open recent messages in new windows.  But I'm getting near 60 pages of reponses, so answering anything past the most recents strips is going to get harder and harder. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The writing style of Snow Crash is rather awkward, but I am enjoying the density of detail and invention.  I look forward to reading Stephenson's more recent works.

      OK, open up mirc.  <br/>

When it shows you mirc options, go to the servers option (under connect). <br/>

From that list select one of the slashnet servers. Do not mess with ports or anything. <br/>

Go back the connect option. Fill in the stuff there with whatever (Don't leave them blank). Hit connect. <br/>

      well, there should be a pull-down menu that lists some Servers you can connect to.  Find the one that is...slashnet?  I believe.  I would check, but the internet is hard. <br/>

Anyway, just find the Slash(whatever) server, and then where you can type in a room or...channel, type in #achewood. <br/>

I guess I originally saw it as a way to keep a bit of clutter out of the assetbarrio, but it is just becoming its own thing.  I guess it's just becoming another little achewood community, like the facebook group or yahoo group I hear rumors of.  Sorry if people think I'm spamming it, just trying to get word out.  We've had a steady trickle of new people coming in, it's cool.

      This is a secret whisper to all the people who love Obama but are afraid right now.  Anyone else:  I respect your opinion but disagree politely.  Anyway:  Secret whisper:  Obama is going to win in November for a few reasons: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. John McCain doesn't know anything about the economy and by November we will all be eating shoes. <br/> 
2. John McCain, whether out of context or not, has a sound bite that says he wants 100 years of war.  That is bad for him. <br/> 
3. He is the successor of the most reviled president in the history of polling.  The number of homoerotic photos of him fondling Bush out there are staggering. <br/> 
4.  The only thing the press loves more than a hero is tearing one down.  It is happening to Obama right now, and once they turn on McCain, it will be even worse, mostly because his negative aspects are even more glaring than Obama's. <br/> 
5.  McCain is, like, a bajillion years old. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, this is meant as balm for people that already agree with me, and is in no way meant to start a flame war.

      Yea I mean this is why I think it's kinda silly when people make a big deal out of pointing out that they don't vote by party but based on the candidate, because no matter what someone actually believes, he's pretty much going to have to adopt the party platform if he wants to get the nomination and then get re-elected. So the only time you could expect a president to do something outside party lines is at the end of his second term, like Bush did with immigration (and even that was more a pro-business move than a pro-minority one).

I hear that in far-off lands there's a form of "compulsory" voting where you just basically get fined if you don't vote. We need that here. It is just difficult for us sometimes because everyone's always trying to disenfranchise certain groups of people to make sure that their party wins. Like people will put up signs that say, "Don't forget to vote on Wednesday!" when actually you have to vote Tuesday. This actually happens.

      Many studies have found that when you ask the non-voters how they would have voted, it turns out pretty much the way the election went anyway.  But everyone thinks the non-voters would have helped only their side.  People don't vote because they are cool with whatever happens, or turned off by the whoel process.  Either way, they get the government they deserve.

      I've voted in every goddamned election (and not just the presidential ones--local, state, etc.) since the year 2000 when I turned 18.  I've caucused.  I've been a county delegate.  The explanation for why so many in the US don't vote, in my humble opinion, comes down to education.  Education, education, education.  I can only speak in reference to the public schools I attended (which were probably about average quality).  But in my experience we're taught a lackluster, cursory overview of the basic structure of our government--three branches, checks and balances, George Washington, two senators per state, etc.--just enough to get students past the SATs, while boring them into thinking the subject is too complicated and futile to want to learn anything further about it.  Certainly not the kind of instruction that might get kids interested in or  <em>excited</em>  about their own damn government.  We certainly are NOT taught how, let alone  <em>encouraged</em> , to PARTICIPATE in government from the local level on up.  The result is that kids leave school not thinking about the government as something that they have a stake in, something that they can affect or influence.  It becomes in people's minds like this mysterious, nebulous, monolithic entity that you pay taxes to in lieu of sacrificing a goat.  They don't think of it as  <em>their own</em>  government, which rightfully it should be; it belongs to the people--they just don't realize it.  And of course this makes things much easier for the powers that be.  And there are so many great shows on tv besides.... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, that's my piece.  "Why Americans Don't Vote More" by A Frog Named Ethel.  I'd like to thank my mother for reading Doonesbury to me when I was a kid.

      I think lack of voting comes from the lack of participation in community.  Communities have become less diverse also - have become more homogenous in their viewpoints and such.. different groups of kids used to mingle more than they do today.  lack of education comes from various factors, including lack of participatory community.  Yes lack of education is part of why people don't vote, but, I don't see it as being a main reason.  The main reason is that they system of community, of society, is broken, in so far as it is ill-adapted to the governmental system that it has, or, conversely, you could say that the governmental system is broken because it is ill-adapted to the systems of society and community that exist in this country.  Either way, this country is screwed and on it's way out if at least one of these two items (government or social systems) doesn't shift paradigms immediately, nay, yesterday.

      But then we get the opposite, but just as bad: the citizens donkey voting or drawing a picture, because they don't care.  You also get politicians pandering to the lowest common denominator of the general public (but I guess you get that in the US as well, but also possibly more focused toward special interest groups who they know  <em>will</em>  vote). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I feel a solution could be to work around the majority of people's biggest deciding factor when it comes to the compulsion to do things -  <strong>laziness.</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
What you do is make voting automatically compulsory for all citizens, but with the option of manually opting out.  This way, the majority of people will still vote, purely because they're too busy/lazy/disorganised to go and un-enrol to vote down at their local politician's office.  But the people who truly don't want to vote, can. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The same should go for organ donorship - automatically signed up for it, but you can choose not to be (though most won't).  The opposite, as we see in Australia, results in a lot of people approving of organ donorship, but not having actually signed up - and it doesn't damn well work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My last idea would be quite controversial and would most likely ruin my campaign once the opposition gets hold of it.

      Their platforms really are pretty similar, no matter what anyone says, and some (like Paul Krugman) say that HIlary's healthcare plan is better.

      first off, people who think that politics and religion and such should not be discussed... what is up with that?  no one's asking you to participate.  just keep scrolling. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I personally don't support Hillary.  I think that this country needs leadership with the conviction and the lunacy of Charlton Heston when he said "From my cold dead hands."  Hillary plays ball.  She's damn good at it too.  This country doesn't need someone who plays ball.  This country needs someone who will go postal on all the fuck heads who play ball, Hillary included.  O'Bama is as close as we are going to get to such a person, this election.  For Hillary to be electable, and to also not be a partisan disaster after she's elected, she would have to have that crazy Dirty Hairy conviction.  That Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid Thelma & Louise kamikaze attitude.  That Ronald Reagan cowboy demeanor.  America doesn't want a president that exudes corporate bullshit compromise in word and in action.  America is not going to vote for someone who reminds us of all the corporate bullshit the little man has to put up with on a daily basis, from our bosses, from our health insurance companies, from the pages of fine print that we can't read in the TV commercials.  We're stupid but we're not fucking dummies.  We know what it takes to get to where Hillary is at.  We know the rules of the game.  And we know the game needs to be changed.  The game is Hillary's life.  Sure she means well, and she would do better than most, but the one thing she won't do is choke the fucking beast with her bare hands around it's neck until it's dying breath no matter how much it kicks and claws at her.  Hillary will not do this.  Remember also that America is stupid, juvenile, sophomoric.  How the fuck else do you explain Bush Jr. for one term, let alone two!  Two fucking terms!  The inescapable conclusion, when you look at the numbers, and extrapolate those as representative of everyone, voters and non-voters alike, is that a good 50% of America was dumb enough to vote for Bush, and probably easily another 35% was so fucking dumb that although they didn't vote for Bush, they had a tough time making that call and it was a close call.  So yeah.  Fuck policy.  This election is not about policy.  There is no way that this election can be about policy.  This election is about whatever will crank the nut of a stupid, juvenile, sophomoric and uneducated population.  In all probability and likelihood, right now at this very instant as you read this, there is somewhere in the Amazon jungle a butterfly about to determine the next president of the United States of Fucking America.  Somebody please shoot me.

      Okay okay already.  here I hope this helps: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 first off, people who think that politics and religion and such <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	should not be discussed... what is up with that? no one's asking <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	you to participate. just keep scrolling. <br/> <br/> <br/> I personally don't support Hillary. I think that this country needs <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	leadership with the conviction and the lunacy of Charlton Heston <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	when he said "From my cold dead hands." Hillary plays ball. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	She's damn good at it too. This country doesn't need someone who <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	plays ball. This country needs someone who will go postal on all <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	the fuck heads who play ball, Hillary included. O'Bama is as <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	close as we are going to get to such a person, this election. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	For Hillary to be electable, and to also not be a partisan <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	disaster after she's elected, she would have to have that crazy <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	Dirty Hairy conviction. That Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	Thelma & Louise kamikaze attitude. That Ronald Reagan cowboy <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	demeanor. America doesn't want a president that exudes corporate <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	bullshit compromise in word and in action. America is not going <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	to vote for someone who reminds us of all the corporate bullshit <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	the little man has to put up with on a daily basis, from our <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	bosses, from our health insurance companies, from the pages of <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	fine print that we can't read in the TV commercials. We're <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	stupid but we're not fucking dummies. We know what it takes to <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	get to where Hillary is at. We know the rules of the game. And <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	we know the game needs to be changed. The game is Hillary's <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	life. Sure she means well, and she would do better than most, <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	but the one thing she won't do is choke the fucking beast with <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	her bare hands around it's neck until it's dying breath no <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	matter how much it kicks and claws at her. Hillary will not do <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	this. Remember also that America is stupid, juvenile, <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	sophomoric. How the fuck else do you explain Bush Jr. for one <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	term, let alone two! Two fucking terms! The inescapable <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	conclusion, when you look at the numbers, and extrapolate those <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	as representative of everyone, voters and non-voters alike, is <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	that a good 50% of America was dumb enough to vote for Bush, and <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	probably easily another 35% was so fucking dumb that although <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	they didn't vote for Bush, they had a tough time making that <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	call and it was a close call. So yeah. Fuck policy. This <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	election is not about policy. There is no way that this election <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	can be about policy. This election is about whatever will crank <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	the nut of a stupid, juvenile, sophomoric and uneducated <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	population. In all probability and likelihood, right now at this <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	very instant as you read this, there is somewhere in the Amazon <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	jungle a butterfly about to determine the next president of the <br/> 
 <br/> 
 	United States of Fucking America. Somebody please shoot me.

      Word! I'm enjoying this arc moreso than the Shrovis arc, mainly because this one a) highlights Onstad's ability to write characters who speak through their own voice rather than that of the author, and b) highlights Onstad's gift for mangling the English language in interesting and humourous ways.

      My mind works more similarly to Roast Beef's than I originally would have hoped. For example, in my brief, painful career at a diner, I was grating mass amounts of cheese to go on the burgers, but it also went in the salads. As the grater was so huge, I kept nicking my knuckles on it. My train of thought was something along the lines of <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Oh, no, what if it gets infected? Or, what if I grate off a whole chunk of my skin, and I bleed all over the worktop? Or, what if that little chunk of skin falls into the cheese, and that cheese goes in someone's salad, and that someone is a vegetarian and they find a little chunk of meat in their salad, and they complain and I get blamed, or they go further than that and actually sue us and the whole restaurant closes down and it's all my fault and I have to compensate the owner with 50% of my paycheck for the rest of my life?</em>

      Once while working in a kitchen, grating tons of delicious whole milk provolone, I cut off the tip of my index finger in a giant 70s era industrial grater. The owner was there that morning and sent me to the emergency room for no reason other than she was worried I would sue (which was silly as I was 15 and not very injured) and so I went to the hospital and when I got back I found out that nobody else knew it had happened so they used that cheese on a pizza! <br/> 
 <br/> 
It haunts me that the person who ultimately consumed it probably thought it was just another piece of sausage or bacon or what have you and ate it and never knew. <br/>

Part of me was in their intestines.

      OK, either one of you guys is named Wanda and you are lying about your age, or finger nubs ending up in pizzas is much more common than we would like to think. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The same thing happened to a woman named Wanda at the pizza place that I worked at in high school.  She was scooping the grated cheese out of a big Hobart mixing bowl but she forgot to remove the blades first and cut her finger.  She was sent off to the hospital and we threw out the cheese that was in the mixing bowl.  But the cheese that was already in the bucket got put in the fridge.  When Wanda got back from the hospital, she told us that she had not just cut her finger but actually sliced off a chunk on the side. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We all told ourselves that the finger bit went into the trash with the cheese still inthe mixer.  But the thought that it might have fallen into the cheese bucket was a good horror story.

      I think with the amounts of cheese and therefore time spent grating, it is not such an uncommon occurrence. I am certainly not lying, I can still see the scar from the injury. Just barely, though. Maybe i'm imagining it.

      It is not that uncommon.  Doing prep dough work at Pizza Hut, I sliced an angled portion of my middle finger off with a serrated knife while portioning dough.  (bleeding slightly onto the dough, along with the tiny bit of finger)  I went to the hospital to get it stitched and covered, then went back to finish my shift (managers have no heart).  I asked my coworker what the manager had done with the dough--he said he had cut a swath of dough out where the incident occurred, and had used the rest.  Yeah. <br/> 
 <br/> 
PS: The dough?  It was "hand tossed".

      I was previously of the opinion that the fictional character of gladi8orrex added nothing valuable to the board, but I think the author is really starting to develop him and take him in interesting new directions. I'm looking forward to a Robert Hamburger-type thing where we slowly get an unintentional window into gladi8orrex's troubled home life and adolescent insecurities.

      this comic reminds me of a true story.  My managers at work were all pissed off at me because I can be a bitch, and I sometimes send e-mails that are... creative... in a linguistic and expressionistic sort of way...  maybe even after a sort of Tom Greenish style.  so they gave my e-mails to the company doctor, who confirmed that I am a main lunatic.  So.  That's why I have so much time to kill on Assetbar.  I don't really have a job.  I just collect disability pay and I have to go see a shrink every now and again.  Yet I still feel as if there isn't enough time in the day to get everything done.  Yet I still kill time on Assetbar. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In other news I'm looking to marry a Canadian or a Norwegian chick, for the citizenship.  We could have sex too, if you want.  If you're not too ugly.  I guess I'd go for pretty much any EU country too.  As long as they have decent single-payer health care.

      I know it's out of place to make serious life suggestions to internet people, but like... have you ever considered just NOT giving vent to these expressionistic linguistic exercises? I mean as crazy as you think you are, I can relate to about 75% of the stuff you say on an inner level, but the difference is  I generally keep it in my mind, where it belongs. I mean what do you really hope to accomplish by foisting it on others - some kind of passive-aggressive revenge simply by virtue of making them uncomfortable? It seems like a pretty paltry reward. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, maybe if you'd had Assetbar (where this shit is accepted about 50% of the time) to vent on instead of work (where it's accepted about 0% of the time) you'd be able to function normally. But that would be asking a lot of us.

      hey it would be hypocritical of me to expect anyone to edit themselves or to be upset if they didn't.  Au contraire mon frere, your point is well taken.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sometimes I harass and intellectually molest people with my iconoclasm and creativity purposefully, but also to a large degree I am ignorant of the extent to which I have this effect on people without my even trying.  Getting along socially with individuals and with groups is something that some people just suck at.  Ya know, there's always that awkward nerdy kid in the class who is picked on and isn't smart enough to even figure out why.  I am that kid.  Of course, if it's a class full of jocks, the kid stands out more, whereas, in a class of reasonably intellectual kids, like some advanced math class or something, such a kid will kind of perhaps be a bit obtuse socially, but it won't really be an issue.  So anyway, it's hard to say objectively how much it's me who's crazy, and how much it's everyone else.  I'm certainly not Urkle.  And American pop culture is certainly... shit.  Ya know... when the psyche, the ego, the very soul of a person, is revolving so much around materialistic concerns as brands and styles of clothing and American sports (not to be confused with sports) and American wrestling (not to be confused with wrestling,) well... ya know.. it makes it a little harder to connect with such a person, or a group of such people.  I know I sound condescending and self-righteous and pompous, but really I'm not.  Even if I'm maybe not finding the best way to express it, I am pointing out an actual phenomenon in American culture, one which is in the same category as a cousin I had who was strapped to a chair by his babysitter and sat in front of the T.V. for hours on end...  He had the entire TV lineup memorized and would literally rock back and forth when not watching TV.  We're talking serious cognitive and mental developmental difficulties.  Don't get me wrong, I'm great with kids, I get along with them great, but when kids don't completely make that transition into adulthood, when they're missing something, developmentally, you know, and they do stuff like vote for Bush... How do you relate to them?  Now I understand that this is the norm in this country, and I understand that it is in fact me who is missing something as much as it is them, in so far as my difficulty with relating to them, but anyway, I'm just sayin'... it ain't all me, and it's kind of hard to pin down how much of it is me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As far as functioning normally...  Do you mean like, keeping up the appearance of being normal?  Or simply collecting a paycheck?  'cause don't get me wrong - it ain't hard for me to collect a paycheck.  Especially in my current job, which is union.  But yeah, some day I'll have to get a real job, and pretend to be normal again.  Boy that will suck.
