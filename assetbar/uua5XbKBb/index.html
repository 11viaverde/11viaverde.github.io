      One of my childhood friends is turning into Showbiz.  Dropped out of college.  Lives with his parents.  Thinks he's cool because he's carving a pipe out of discarded christmas tree wood.

      A person does not equal cool unless the summation of their life's actions coolness equals cool. It takes a drastic amount of cool in one act to redeem a life of anitcool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Carving a pipe out of wood is pretty damn cool though

      I didn't get this until I went to a wedding in California, but auto dealerships and housing developments out there will hire dudes to stand at busy intersections and twirl signs around to draw attention. I saw many of these poor dudes; the groom told me that if they show insufficient energy, they are fired on the spot. That is probably what happened to Showbiz.

      Two pizza places in the area on our highways used to hire people for the task of shaking a pizza sign. One got a very frightening Carrot Top look-alike, so the other one went with a former stripper wearing fishnets and high heels. That was ... a subject of intrigue, I'll say.

      For co-op, I had to go outside and walk hold a sign up for oncoming traffic for a sale we were having. <br/>

      When I was about fourteen I held up a sign in the middle of a highstreet for my friend's dad, who did French markets. It was horrifically boring, and loads of people who walked passed me would go "Ohh, she didn't look too happy, did she?" like, the second they were behind me, as though I couldn't hear them, and I was like, well, what do you think, would you be grinning like a fucking maniac if you were in my position? <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I got paid like ï¿½7.50 an hour and did it for a total of ten hours, so that was fairly sweet.
