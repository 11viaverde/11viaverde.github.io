      No, Ray needs for Philippe to stay by that ugly plant. You can't check on your Harman Kardons and solve mysteries with a five year old otter telling you all about how you should like 1882 because some boring guy was nice.

      Ray would, with his wealth and lack of knowlege buy a pricey harmon kardon setup and then have a security force watch them. He could have gone with krell, or vandersteen, tannoy, or bowers & wilkins, but he picked the skim milk of high end audio. Ray you simple man. Totally fits with his character.

      Are they really that bad? My headphone standards are quite low admittedly, as I only got this pair when you could properly see all the wires hanging out of my last pair and the quality had deteriorated to the point where it sounded like all my music had been recorded in a metal rubbish bin, so perhaps I'm not the martyr the Bose cause has been waiting for.
