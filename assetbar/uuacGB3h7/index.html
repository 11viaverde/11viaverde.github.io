      She's related to the Playboy advisor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In Achewood, mundane coporate institutions, from Playboy, to Butterball, to Heinz and the generic Mexican Magical Realism Factory, all have fantastic knowledge and abilities. I really like this dimension. It makes me think of that string of Stephen King short stories about the New York club where old lawyers would sit and drink and tell bizarre and terrifying stories from their past.

      I think it was actually a novella in "Different Seasons," one of King's best collections- it contained "The Shawshank Redemption," "Apt Pupil," and "The Body" (which was later made into the movie "Stand by Me") as well as the aforementioned story of lawyers telling tales in a club in New York.

      It was indeed an excellent collection and it contained, in order: "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption", "Apt Pupil", "The Body",and the only one not made into a film and which likely never will be, "The Breathing Method". Each was also linked to a season: "Hope Springs Eternal", "Summer of Corruption", "Fall From Innocence", and "A Winter's Tale". I forgot the framing device used, but this was also (according to Wikipedia) used in "The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands". Overall the story was somewhat interesting, but not up to the caliber of the other stories and relied entirely on it's simple gimmick. It would have worked much better as a shorter story.

1998, it seems. It features Gandalf as the horrible Nazi. (Which is different from the lovable Nazis like Sgt. Schultz from Hogan's Heroes.)

      YES!  The set up was very cool (with the lawyers), but the actual story was really nothing special to me.  Nazis, daring prison escapes, and childhood friendships will always be more interesting to me than cheap ghost stories.

      I did a little research and it has been announced as a project that one of the producers of the Friday the 13th remake is working on. There's no other names attached at this time so it may never see the light. I agree that the story as is can't support a film, it was probably purchased due to the sucess of the other stories.

      Yes, buy it...then drive it around the country, leaving it parked in a busy lot in a different town each day.  Make sure you have a KFC bucket in the passenger seat.  When you return to the car at the end of day, ready to move on to the next town, see how many "NOTICE THAT YOUR CAR IS FRIKKING AWESOME/where'd you get" slips you accumulate throughout your journey.

      It is a usual Catholic belief. I think the theory goes that if you kill yourself, you can't then repent and ask forgiveness for that final sin. Therefore you go to Hell.  <br/>

      Well, if you set things in motion that will result in your eventual definite death, then I think you should be able to repent for that act before it comes to fruition. <br/>

When I was with my ex, we used to have a tradtion that around Christmas time we'd have a mini-party with his parents and sister and her boyfriend, and this involved a quiz. One year one of the questions was, "What's the name of the first movie that Zach Braff wrote, directed and starred in?" and my ex went (in total seriousness), "Oh, oh, Dr. Acula!" <br/>

      Sorry, but Scrubs would be 90% shit without John McGinley and Neil Flynn. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was about to say I have nothing against Zach Braff, but then I realized that my two favorite characters on Scrubs are the two that torment Zach Braff's character. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Eh, probably just a coincidence.

      I have nothing against his character in Scrubs, who is the perfect foil for your aforementioned favorites. If   <em>Garden State</em>  was any good, I'd have all kinds of anxiety about Braff -- this is a guy who hired an Israeli woman so that he, in his fantasized version of himself, could tell her he wasn't really very Jewish. Fortunately for me,  <em>Garden State</em>  was the most puerile, self-obsessed, illiterate attempt at extending the author's adolescence since  <em>Birth of a Nation</em> , and I need feel no discomfort about fucking hating that motherfucker whatsoever.

      The abruptness of the last panel is really what makes this comic a 5, in my opinion.  Ostad's choice to not actually  <em>show</em>  Beef's death is both artistic and humourous at the same time -- 'adds nicely to the flow, I mean.

      I always thought that, too.  It just seems like a natural thing for Beef to do while on the phone, like how most people would pace back and forth.  It's probably his depression and the mad slant he's probably got on after his best friend's death.
