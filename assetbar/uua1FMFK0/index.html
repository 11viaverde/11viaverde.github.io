      XKCD is in a 3-way tie for my favorite online comic, tied with Achewood and Dinosaur Comics. Keep in mind that I'm a Physics major, so that may have something to do with my enjoyment of the strip.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just to note, though... Onstad and Munroe have totally different styles of humor. Munroe pulls off a pretty good satire of Onstad, but you should read xkcd before passing judgement on his Onstad-imitation chops. I find that one appreciates his incredible talent for respectful satire more after reading the rest of his comics. I'd say Munroe is definitely a creative genius, just like North and Onstad. Just in a different way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway. I say we give Munroe a rad day.

      Well, it wasn't really a blanket judgement of the man's whole Thing, or nothin'. But yeah, I'll check it before I wreck it. Thinking back, there were probably about twenty seconds early on during which I didn't know what to think of this comic, either. If I hadn't taken a second look, I might be...um...doing something else right now. Shudder to think.

      Alright, doc_rostov. I'm back and I now feel that I have seen enough XKCD to effectively pass judgment. It's OK. Not bad. Not spectacular. It does make me feel foolish for thinking that I could never produce a cartoon strip for the simple fact that I cannot draw. Munroe doesn't let his inability limit him, and that's sort of valiant. In a way. But for that to be tied with Achewood on top of your list, well, we are very different people. Diversity is beautiful.

      I'm with you. It's OK. Sometimes I wish he'd taken a bit longer before posting the comic, and run the joke through the "quality committee". But hey, that's true about all of our outputs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think that Onstad's satire was really intended to be that mean, I think he just kind of randomly grabbed images, like he'd said.

      At first I thought Ray was doing this "Just in case things are weird and I hadn't noticed, 'cause you know, I've been doing other stuff, here's a Rad Day," but no!  The alt text clears up this misappropriation of his reasoning, because, as noted: "Ray was just doing this for whatever reason." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, I find this interesting.  This hearkens back to an earlier, more care-free Ray - a different Ray than the one I have been seeing evolve.  I consistently assume that Ray has taken on some aspects of Roast Beef (as, similarly, Beef has taken on some aspects of Ray as the comic's years roll on)* and has become more conscious of and concerned for people's feelings and their relationships with him - with Teodor being a particular conundrum for him.  As good of friends as they are, they frequently emotionally miscommunicate.  They just work on different wavelengths, and Ray you can notice ("baths only",  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145029/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua2fKpSP">under the table</a> , etc.**) perhaps subconsciously feels off guard by this at times. <br/>

      It is?  *checks internets* <br/> 
 <br/> 
Heh, so it is.  Well then, I scoff at you all! I and my boringly monolingual ways! <br/> 
 <br/> 
That being said, somehow your Scandinavian ladies (and the men, too, I'm comfortable with saying) are consistently hawt.  Like,  <em>consistently</em>  super hot.  Is it all the cheese?  Do you kill off anyone average-looking?  Doesn't this lead to inbreeding?  Did the Vikings send all the ugly ones to conquer the British Isles, leaving all the attractive ones back home for specialist breeding?  Do you just send all the average ones to live in the Netherlands? (oooh, burn!) Or, do you just only allow the pretty ones to travel and emigrate, thus meaning they are the only ones I've met? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Any one of these are a possibility.  Nay,  <em>probability</em> .

      You kinda answered your own question there, with all of the possibilites (nay, probabilites) being cold, hard facts. <br/> 
And don't forget that the Vikings' mission was bringing home pretty much anything that resembled a rude pair of titties.

      That is indeed awsome. <br/> 
But should it be translated correctly (which it shouldn't; it's a name) it's "Lens Electricity Violence" (almost), and the name of the show is (you guessed it) "Super-Auto Evening" (almost - slight misspelling from Onstad there, 'Kvåal' is really 'Kväll'). <br/>
