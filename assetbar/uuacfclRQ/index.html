      also, the fact that Molly's mother consider's daughters something to be avoided (to the extent of killing a fine trout and not looking away), and is telling this to Molly, her daughter, might be a bit inflammatory.

      Not exactly the "things will be quiet" camp, but definitely the "shut up and be quiet." I mean hell, just look at her: she's faking her whole life, she doesn't want to do that. Her parents force things upon her and she doesn't want to do them, so I figure that's where this is going to end up. And, on a side note, does all this imply that her parents never knew she was dead? Or maybe they didn't care, her being a girl?

      Killing a trout with your bare hands while staring into its eyes is pretty much the manliest thing you can do.  The more ferocity with which it is done, the manlier and more badass your child will be. <br/>

Ramses' mother did this with a shark while he was in the womb.  Cornelius' mother just killed a normal chat, but instead of merely looking it in the eyes, she had a full conversation with it, sharing stories and discussing fine literature, until finally the trout turned to her and said "I think it's time now.

      I just got the 1995 reissue of Leeds (my dad had the short albeit still amazing 1990 CD issue with only 6 songs), and this is a nice little coincidence for me too.  Now that I think about it, it's the perfect song for any catered event.  Weddings, christenings, funerals ESPECIALLY.  It's basically a eulogy.  "On top of the sky is the place where you go if you've done nothing wrong IF YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRO-HA-HONG.  And down in the ground is the place where you go if you've been a bad boy IF YOU'VE BEEN A BAD BO-OY.  Why can't we have eternal life and never die?" ::mourners throw dirt into grave::

      Given the times given on his schedule, one would assume, T is listening on his personal iPod, and that the song is not being played at the reception or something, which says weird things about Teodor.  I think only a crazy person could willingly listen to "Heaven and Hell" more than 5 times in a row.

      Well I wouldn't mind it on for 8 hours on my wedding day, personal or otherwise.  Actually, I want "Semi-Multicolored Caucasian" by Captain Beefheart played at my wedding.

      'Look into my eyes and say these are not <br/>

Is the singer of this song claiming that he has drunk so much beer that even his eyes are full of beer (beer meniscus right up at the top above the iris and all)? I find that a very nice concept.

      Naw, "completely full of beer" is simply a thing to be shouted when one is full of beer to emphasize exactly  <em>how</em>  full of beer you actually are.  <br/>

      And the phrase MUST be followed by a preposterously loud and alacritous eructation for maximum emphasis.   Otherwise people will think you're only, you know, plump with beer or some such nonsense.

      Other options are erratically saying, "I'm not drunk  <em>you're</em>  drunk" to people who have previously been completely silent on the subject, or ending every sentence with a slurred "Did you know that?"

      Yes, there is a common misapprehension that being completely full of beer leads to adventures and the performance of the sexual act. More commonly it leads to being a bit of a wanker in company.

It's hard to imagine Ray missing Beef's wedding though.  These strips are depressing sometimes, but I think that in the end the wedding has to go right for Beef.  It would just be way too sad if it didn't. <br/>

I can imagine Ray coming late, though.  Maybe bursting in right at "speak now, or forever hold your peace" but not having any objections.

      Ok, Beef, I know you and your family are generally of low circumstances, but iceberg lettuce? Dogg, that barely even qualifies as edible, let alone wedding-class fare. Heck, I think I might even prefer a blue fescue salad with a light malathion dressing to iceberg with ranch.

      Having looked up BTU's it seems that there is method to Teodors madness, apparently american heating systems often use BTU/hour as a measure of power, so imperial units are actually easier to use in this case. A BTU is simply the energy to heat 1 lb of water by 1 degree farenheit. Teodor's calculations are correct, and it will take about 17 minutes to boil the water.

It is probably the best strip in a long time.

      I don't think that gladi8orrex should be muzzled like this, but I don't think that he shouldn't be lamed for this either.  Ergo, Assetbar needs a  <em>friendly lame</em>  function, for when you are laming someone not to silence them, but merely to express,  <em>affectionately,</em>  that they and/or their post is lame.  In absence of such a function, I do consider laming gladi8orrex to be overkill... this is putting him on a par with other far more douchy characters, if you know whom I mean... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also don't think that panhandling should be allowed on assetbar.  Don't get me wrong I've got nothing against gladi8orrex personally, but if you start giving spare chuppies to one guy, then pretty soon you attract other less savory panhandlers and before you know it you have to constantly be looking down when you walk to avoid stepping on syringes.

      I started from the first one and I am up to # 91 of QC.    Yeah, it is a little simplistic and juvenile in how it has this ongoing theme of Martin lusting after Faye and Faye flirting with Martin.  And now I jumped over to #500 and read a few from there, and it is a little melodramatic.  And yeah, the punchlines are often grade-B sitcom-quality material. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said, it is what you see it to be, achilleselbow.  There is an outline of the characters being developed, and there is an outline of some story being developed with those characters.  You've got to use your imagination and fill in the outline.  Try to focus on what's good about it and what you like about it, and chalk the sometimes overly kitchy or melodramatic moments up to irony.  If your imagination focuses on what you perceive to be shortcomings of the comic, is that the author's responsibility, or is it also yours?  Storytelling is an art, and so is listening. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't mean to condescend.  I'm just advancing the idea that the line between liking and disliking a comic or a person can be a thin line, and to some extent, to a really large extent, you create the experience that you have.

      oh, they're virtually all godawful.  You gotta look past that.  Like reading a book.  A book is just black ink on white paper, which is not very entertaining.  That is my analogy.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would guess that most people wouldn't like QC because QC presents situations set in specific culture settings with which the reader is familiar, but the situation and the dialogue play out in a way that is non-sensical and innane and stilted in these cultural contexts.  I don't have a problem with this, because I suspend disbelief in this regard when I read QC.  Also, I am much less fluent in these cultural contexts than most of you probably are. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it would help QC with a lot of readers if there was a lot less in QC that was familiar and evocative of the cultural contexts to which QC's story does not conform.

      Look, I'm gonna get lamed if I get into this again, so I'm just gonna give you this bit of advice. You said you've only read 90 of them so far. At this point you probably still get a couple of chuckles and enjoy the indie rock references, plus you're wondering what's gonna happen with Faye and Marten. So you keep reading. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But sometime, maybe 100 strips later, you will be in the middle of a strip when you will suddenly hear a noise. Perhaps it will be a dog barking, or someone dropping their keys, or even just the wind. In any case, it will be enough to snap you out of your engrossed state for just a second. And in that second, you will chance to look at the strip and see it as a completely foreign object and you will say to yourself: "What is this? Why am I reading this? I haven't laughed at it in months. All of these characters are completely flat and two-dimensional, not to mention annoying as hell - why do I care what happens to them? They'll either just make out with each other or make out with someone else! What...what have I been  <em>doing</em>  with my life?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then a choir of angels will sing, and you will slowly walk out your front door, where the entire town will be gathered to applaud you, and your father will be there smiling emphatically as a tear of joy drips from his eye. "We knew you could do it, son," he'll say. "We believed in you."

      I think you're taking my knee-jerk reactions to it too seriously. I was going to type "YouTube users" but at the last second changed it to "QC readers" just because the first would have been too boring, and because at this point I'm kind of self-parodying the fact that hating QC has sort of become my Thing, so I feel the need to inflate my mild disgust with it into an all-encompassing hatred.

I am up to comic # 240 of QC so far today, and it's basically 200 some strips that are all part of the SAME ARC... I'm starting to loose my mind... yet I keep reading...  I like it... it just takes a certain amount of self-control to uh, suspend disbelief... you gotta consider QC from an abstract vantage point... very abstract...  Does the author intend it this way?  maybe not... I don't know...

      I think that it is more likely that Molly, after becoming interested in computers in heaven, decided to keep better track of the happenings down on the old green Earth. Her family however, being of a simpler culture, did not continue to watch over the changing times, thus their (for lack of a better term on my tongue) culture shock. Also, I think that Ray is just charging all of his Aibos on a power-strip.

      Well I guess the possibility of Achewood ending would all depend on the comic's thesis as a whole. The funny thing is... I just finished a course on identifying story thesises and I can't do that for Achewood. Considering Beef wasn't brought in for a while, I wouldn't guess Achewood's thesis was "Beef overcame his rough life history and got married", but over time it's become clear that Beef is Onstad's favorite character. So... the story of Achewood could go either way here. I hope it doesn't end...

      Why is no one talking about this premium content? I want to talk about it but no one is talking about it on this entire goddamn page (or at least a search for the word premium finds only your comment) <br/>

I personally won't be signing up at the moment, not because I'm some huffy asshole but because I have no job and therefore the fee is too great for me to pay. Any other opinions?

      In the short term it'll pull in some cash but in the longer term, I think offering the content for free would create more good will, which would translate into more cash.  I don't mean good will in the sense of people feeling kindly about getting content for free, I mean in the sense of building brand value and reaching more of a market. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It'd be nice to be able to test drive the premium content. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It'd also be nice if you could get a free premium account if you referred a few non-premium accounts.  For as long as those non-premium accounts remain active, your premium account is free. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After a browser has read, say, 50 strips in the archive, the server should say "fuck you, you need to sign up a free non-premium account if you want to read more from the archive."  That would be a non-premium account.  It would give you the ability to surf the entire archive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
but yeah it's a catch-22... Onstead has to pay the bills... but no matter what content he sets aside as 'premium,' he is shooting himself in the foot in the long run... restricted access content brings in revenue but does not contribute as effectively towards building up a fan base.

      If Achewood ended before it's time, I would guess that at least a couple of the enterprising fans would get together and continue the strip in some similar fashion and style as has been so far displayed by Onstead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There might even come to be competing 'versions' of Achewood, including versions authored by such devoted fans as Gladi8orrex and Dr. Manflesh... <br/> 
 <br/> 
More to the point, however, is the question of if Achewood is simply The Great American Comic Strip-Novel, or, if it is something more ... if it is perhaps the ushering in of a new genre in litterary art?  If the case is the former, then Achewood lives and dies by the hand of Onstead.  If, however, the case is the latter, then the future portends more expression in this genre, with Achewood it's self representing a mere toe-hold in the vast possibility that lies ahead in this genre.

      If Rostov and Edwell workedtogether on one, I'd pay to support it.  I occasionally throw a little cash to the non-perverted arts.  They are the only ones on here that have any track record of creating something funnier than the strip with any regularity.

      I agree with quantum.  This is all gimmicky and you've just got Onstad's balls too firmly placed over your eyes to see it.  Maybe it's cool that we can get inside info or whatever from the characters' eyes.  Or maybe it was cool when, I don't know,  <em>blogs covered this.</em>   <br/> 
Now I'm not going to stop reading achewood by any long shot.  It's still my favorite comic, and I still really like this story arc.  I just think it's a HUGE departure from Onstad's normal work to do this; he's always had a premium section to be sure, but never one that was this gimmicky.   <br/> 
But I also understand what business is, and understand that he has a kid to raise.  So good for him for interpreting and using the market to his advantage; bad to him for building up a story arc and then making us either a)pay or b)wait for it.

      No, I think it's the other way around; you've got your own balls firmly placed over your eyes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're assuming Onstead planned this gimmic - hey, he's busy, maybe the shit just came together at this time like this.  And how else do you expect it to work... the premium content is gonna be all the shit that's already run in the free comic, rehashed?  That would not sell well.  No, it's got to be the other way around.  Furthermore, he said the free comic will cover the wedding, but from a different perspective.  So I mean, you're gonna get your wedding, but you're not gonna get the premium content, even if you wait for it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would guess that Onstead put a lot of time and effort into the premium stuff because he wants people who pay for it to get their money's worth.  He doesn't wanna be ripping people off.  How much did you pay for the blogs and the free comic so far?  Did he ever promise to continue those efforts forever, in return for whatever you were donating, if anything? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd have to say that in a world of corporate giants, Onstead is, so far, as non-gimmicky and non-commercial as you can get, while still collecting a stipend for your work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're gonna quit reading the comic because you disagree with his business tactics?  Shit man, what is he, Shell oil Inc?  Union Carbide?  You avoid Shell gas stations too, I take it?  You are being like Pat, focusing in on specific manic tendcies of emotions that you have about something like you have blinders on.  You don't have to like it, but you should accept that sometimes you just can't control the entire world around you, and fooling yourself into believing that boycotting something will make a positive difference probably does more harm than good.

1)I said I was  <em>not</em>  going to stop reading the comic. <br/> 
2)I "SURPRISE" presented both sides of the argument, saying that I could see it both ways. <br/>

Look, I know you just OMG<3LUV Achewood and Chris Onstand.  I too am a large fan of this thing here.  But you are too busy trying to get chubbies by saying things that I didn't even say, trying to be the defender of some sort of faux honor that isn't even there.  I believe you would shoot a baby.

      Yeah, if the guy wants to make money off his strip, that's fine.  But the thing about these web-comics these days is that the main bit is free.  Onstad gave us the choicest story arc of the whole damn strip's lifetime, and even gave us a day it's happpening on, then pulled this.  If he wants to sell books, I'll buy em. If he wants to sell cookbooks, I'll buy em.   Even asking for patronage like a 17th century painting-broad, fine.  But keep the main story lines where they have always been.

      You'd be right, but one of the problem is is that the "Wedding Invitations" strip said that it'd be on the fifth of July, and to my knowledge Onstad never gave any warning that it would only be available on that date for people who would pay for it. Hence why people expected him to post it on the fifth, regardless of whether it was a weekend or not.

      Using this arc as a way to plug a new form of information dispersal is disappointing to me. Yes, I realize the man has to make money, but I can disagree with this method all the same. <br/> 
Even with the original subscriber's only content (which I actually purchased a few months ago) holds the premise that it gives you a bit more of a background and context to the strip. <br/> 
This whole ordeal has been an "Oh, snap! Were you expecting a comment? No dice, but you  <em>can</em>  get more information about the daily lives of characters if you pay for it!" <br/> 
I'm not saying it's not an affective business maneuver, I'll even concede that it is a prudent one, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. <br/> 
And I don't, but I share this opinion with full understanding that it is 6 kinds of irrelevant.

      It would have been nice if the comic happened on the day of the wedding.  It seems like he delayed the regular comic to get people to subscribe, or was too busy to get out the daily.  Roast Beef got married on a Saturday, the day of most car-crashes, so I think Onstad can write up a comic.

      Of course I bought the $3.40 feed, I love this strip more than God's baby. I would give Cornelius a spongebath and corn hole Spongebob, if either one of them were into those things.  It just cheapens it to have to, though.

      Walking from a bar to another bar earlier it hit me: Ray Smiles and Chuckles is a lot like Richard Branson. Start a record label? Sure, why not - who cares if you don't know the difference between net and gross (seriously, Richard admits as much)? Start an airline? To hell with the bean counters, let's do it! Shit, he even started his own brand of vodka up - probably owns an Airwolf an all. They get things done is the point. <br/> 
Okay, sorry to jump in the middle of the thing you have going but I had to get it down before brushing my teeth.
