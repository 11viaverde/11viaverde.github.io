      Decimated means to destroy one-tenth of something. It comes from a punishment occasionally employed in Roman martial law. When a legion or battalion attempted desertion as a whole (fairly common near the end of the empire), one tenth of the legion was killed by stoning. It is surprising Onstad made this mistake, and I feel a right asshole correcting him. Of course, I'm also smug.

      Man, whose technical definition?  All the dictionaries I have immediate access to include the secondary definition of "to destroy a large number of."  Let's be forthright here: this ain't about correctness, it's about thinking the original meaning is awesome.  I can dig that!  I light a sad little candle for the literal meaning of "literal" every damn night.  But still, it's unfair to rag on people for using the language as it is, rather than as it should be.

      There's no real question of ignorance; Onstad may well have known the etymology but chose to use it here anyway, and despite the fact that it can indeed be used in its original sense, it is widely used today as meaning 'to wipe out a large proportion', not JUST 10% thereof. Sorry to be a dick, but...yeah.

      Language evolves. It is the nature of language to change and adapt according to new needs and outdated concepts. A bit of investigation (I work in the linguistics department of UBC) reveals that the  <em>very</em>   <em>first</em>  english dictionary ever written (a latin-english "wordbook") listed decimate as "to destroy a large number of". It was written in 1543. Our language does not stagnate, and although etymology and root words are among my passions, the evolution of language is one of the most interesting processes possible. This is an example of how language has changed. In ancient Greece, this would be an incredibly grammatically incorrect word. Do you hold that we should correct it, because those ancient Romans have dumbed it down so much?

      You have just ruined your own argument. You're holding that we should change how "decimate" is spelled, because the Romans screwed it up, but  <em>obviously</em>  we foolish mortals could never hope to change it's definition. If we can change it's spelling, why can't the definition change? It's a much more natural and easily accomplished process. Seriously. Were you thinking when you said that?

      The funniest thing about this whole conversation (maybe the only funny thing about it, actually) is that there was absolutely nothing incorrect about the way in which the word "decimated" was used in this strip. <br/>

It was, however, fairly interesting to track the flow of the argument. Xiaomimi tried and tried again to talk some sense. When she realized that nobody was interested in sense, she politely ducked out and let the boys squabble over some kind of long-obsolete poop.
