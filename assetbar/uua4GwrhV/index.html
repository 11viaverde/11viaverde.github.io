      the easy answer is he's secretly gay (course not anymore), the other answer is that, well I'm not 100% sure but I am quite sure Pat never likes the Cure again and it is instead Teodor . . . So the characters are sorted out later, although Teodor isn't the most developed character, I think one thing fully agreed upon is that he likes the Cure.

      I've steered clear of them for most of my life, really without even trying. Around the people I grew up with, it was easy. They spit on The Cure. It just Wasn't To Be Played in our circles, and that was that. I didn't ask questions, mainly because I'd seen pictures of Robert Smith. That kinda made me less than curious. I have peripherally heard a few songs that didn't seem too bad. Regardless of how or why I've never been a fan, I feel somehow vindicated now. I have so many reasons to thank these cats.

      I just KNOW that some day in the future, someone will use that perfect sass line in total truthfulness. <br/> 
They don't NEED to be on the moon, just 239000 miles from The Cure (who ideally would still exist at that point in time, or some other terrible band will have to be substituted in)

All the voices blur <br/> 
Change to one face <br/> 
Change to one voice <br/> 
Prepare yourself for bed <br/>

All the sounds of <br/>

Into the night with <br/> 
Roast Beef sometimes

      A story: <br/> 
A couple of year's ago, I, a Canadian, crossed from South Africa into Botswana.  By the border there is a Portugese Fried Chicken restaurant.  When I went in, they were playing "Friday I'm In Love" by the Cure.
