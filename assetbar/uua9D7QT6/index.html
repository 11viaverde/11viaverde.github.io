      Hey cats and kittens, I am here with a troll-hunting update. There now exists a global ignore list, so that when a bunch of people lame/ignore a given person, that person will end up on everyone's ignore list (you can still take that person off your list if you want). It is more sensitive to newly registered users, so if you lame/ignore AIU's newest incarnations a lot, they will disappear for everyone. That means less attention for the troll and, hopefully, one day, an Assetbar free of his bodily secretions being spewed everywhere all the time.

      Thank you for that heads up! I can't tell you how much this pisses me off. I have given a few lames before, but hate the effect they have of making things dissapear. I personally do not believe in ignoring anyone. MY CHOICE. Now the Assetbar gods are going to decide who I just don't get to see, without asking me or notifying me? So not cool, Assetbar. So not cool. Guess I'll now start my day unignoring people.

      No reason to be pissed--it's all fully in your control.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you want to read posts with lots of lames, then just set your "hide comments with [ ] or more lames" control to a really big number.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The global ignore is also your choice.  We explicitly made it so YOU CAN decide to not ignore posts by the jerks and douches.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If that's not enough douchy content for you, try browsing your spam folder for great new offers?

      I am impressed with your speedy response. I have just tried again, but am eternally unable to make the lames number move from 3. There have been reports elsewhere of others experiencing the same glitch. Further, I have to actively unignore, as opposed to having a passive do not ignore policy in place. I have periodically checked my ignore list in the past to ensure that I had not accidentally blasted someone. Now it will need to be a routine check. This occurs for me as a nuissance.

      I'm disagreeing with the Lech above me, and for some reason giving loneal a chubby.  A good third of the comments since I came back are people yammering with the troll.  They are completely without nourishment.  I don't actually believe he will disappear (the community doesn't seem to want him gone), but at least it might cut back on the people egging him on.

      Ah yes, that stinky piece of dog turd.  I get the joke, and get why it's supposed to be "so bad it's good", but I still didn't laugh. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That having been said, each time I read it, I smile a little more.  Like watching  <em>Future Cop II</em> ,  <em>Black Belt Jones</em> ,  <em>Hell Comes to Frogtown</em> ,  <em>Yor: Hunter from the Future</em> , or any number of classically shit B-grade cinema - time makes it better, because it becomes an in-joke (even if only with yourself). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Does it therefore achieve its intended purpose?  To be deliberately crap so as to be funny?  I'm not going to answer this categorically, sorry.

      Sorry. My horoscope told me that I would be the cravenest of all today, and I wanted to believe it so badly that I have spent the entire day going through different websites for the opportunity to be craven. But the Internet is such a craven-saturated environment right now, that it's hard for an icon-less up-and-comer like me. I haven't had a craven comment in seven months... and I have a small child's ego to feed, barely old enough to link at all. <br/>

Also, if it helps, I chubbied you above for your cravenness.

      I was just thinking about getting the Volcano Taco, but something about that red taco shell was giving me pause.  To be so blatant about their chemical-infused foodstuffs, it's bold and slightly off-putting.  Even though the food dye in the shell is probably the most benign thing about the taco, I dunno man.  I just don't know.

      The actual big long comic was cool and everything, although my reading of it may have suffered slightly from not being American enough (or at all) (by which I mean I have never had any kind of taco bells), but honestly, this thing here actually makes me laugh more. <br/>

      When Teodor began to eat and write and requested "Serenade," I turned that song on as soundtrack. It then nicely had the decency to fade out just as the bear and cat began to talk again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Having experienced it thusly, I would like to blame the song for Teodor's loss of Jazz. It is the sort that starts strong, especially in the stoned mind, and ends with a whimper. The stoned mind may fixate on such a song for hours, only to find upon finally pumping it on a stereo, that it is not the mind bending river of awesomeness expected, but merely a generic rock out that leaves something to be desired.

      Agreed.  I still love it, but it seems like Onstad is actually trying lately.  Most of the humor in the older comics seemed to stem from him just spouting off random ideas and the occasional arc.  Recently, he seems to just go from arc to arc without significant breaks in between.

      It just seemed to me that he did not say any more, in terms of content, than he would have in his normal format.  It was like it was drawn out to artificially create length.  I enjoy Onstad's word craft, but part of what I enjoy is his economy with words.  That economy creates more room for the readers.

      This is the source of the one thing that annoyed me about this strip -- no mention of the special breast-man menu. <br/> 
It can't be helped, I suppose. You can't plan out all eight pages of jazz like that without hitting a few phrases you've done differently before, and in some cases it's better that way.

I've no idea how long these will remain visible, but here they are. They have been reduced as much as I could without turning the dialog to mush, and are absolutely no replacement for the real thing, but it should help the myspace impaired, and those with old kludgy 'puters. <br/>

      Yeah, I think that's sort of the intention.  It's featured as a comic alongside a few others, I assume that the Dark Horse Myspace is promoting them to people who may have otherwise never heard of such comics.  It wouldn't make much sense for Achewood to not try to reach a new audience through that.

      And now an apology! I read lame where you wrote tame. I thought you were referring to my feeble attempts at humor, not your womanly qualities (which I would not ever give a virtual lame!) (Well, at least not sight unseen. No, not even then!) <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, please read the above as "It - my (lack of) humor - is lame!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
For what it's worth, I've never met boobs so tame that they ceased to be fascinating. I've also never met a woman yet who gave herself proper credit for what and who she is.

      oh yeah, I should correct myself - I was actually very impressed with the color rendering of the car driving along the highway.  That part benefited from color.  But the rendering of the dudes inside the car, that part doesn't seem to benefit from color and maybe even color detracts from it. <br/>

It's kind of like Onstad's drawing style is sort of like drawing style of Matt & Trey Parker's South Park in it's simplicity, and yet at the same time is very realistic.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It depends on the specific scene that Onstad is rendering.  He is a fantastic artist when it comes to the rendering of absurd and/or surreal and/or dramatic types of scenes such as the above mentioned view of the car driving along the highway, yet, drawing Tina he just can't always seem to pull it off, she winds up looking like a collection of ill-fitting geometric shapes or something instead of a person.   <br/>

So what I meant to say is that the use of color seems to accentuate both Onstad's strengths, and, unfortunately, his weaknesses.  Still, I really enjoy his artwork sometimes... it is totally worth it how he renders cars driving down the highway, for instance.

      re: my Marilyn Manson avatar:  generally you can't read too much into an avitar, of Marilyn Manson or otherwise, but in my particular case, I'd say that I sometimes have a provocative espirit de vivre, as does Manson, so perhaps the avitar will sometimes complement my personality/persona/person. <br/>

      this present account, which I created only a few days ago, is unable to change the lame threshold.  So I dunno what the deal is.  So for some accounts, perhaps many accounts, any 3 lames of any post is the same as marking it as spam.  So it would be nice if people would stop doing that.

      However, I should note that when a remark is lamed out of existence, I can still right click on the word "comment" in the message that dutifully notifies us that it is removed, and choose "open in a new tab" or "window", and still read it. I can not reply to it, further lame it or cubby it, and it is a bloody nuisance having to bounce around like that, but at least I'm not blocked from viewing it.

      The core of the issue is this:  It is the taste of a douche.  Maybe it's that one douche with the kim-chi aftertaste, maybe it's a different one with a yeasty aftertaste.  The specific flavor of douche isn't important.  The important thing is that the guy's a douche, set him on ignore.

      Authentically, I don't think you experience any real connection to the people on this site to the degree of having anything like a grasp of how you occur for them in their listening. Not unusual. Most humans have little or no real grasp of how they are seen and heard. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't doubt that you have a concept for it, some understanding of it, or even some expectation of how it's going. I'm not getting any sense of you really grasping it or getting it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My hope is that in the other areas of your life, where you are in actual contact with people, you are able to experience connection, vulnerability and intimacy. It's possible.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Much of what I get from you here is posturing and gadflying, but I sense more depth than you'd like to admit to, and even moments of genuine concern. I've found many of your less posed moments useful and entertaining. Anyway, that's how you occur for me.

      Mexican Pizza is perhaps the nastiest thing this side of the mountain.  Mexican Pizza from anywhere, mind you, not all blame can be shouldered by Taco Bell. <br/>

No, all the blame goes to whatever pile of sooty rags and poor-quality beef got animated by some evil wizard and told to create a pizza so heinous no one can even look at it.  That's the story of Mexican Pizza, and it's the worst.

      does smoking and eating Taco Bell count as suicide?  In a way it's actually more selfish than suicide because of the high medical costs incurred to society before you finally do die, and because of all the money that could have been invested for something useful like your kid's college education instead of being spent on that crap.

      You also have to consider that the menu may include whatever the Taco Bell equivalent of "meal deals" where you get 4 other menu items, for 30 cents less than the cost of buying them individually.  In some cases this would even be things like "3 small burrito", which is no different than 1 "small burrito" except that you have to eat it 3 times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Considering basically 90% of the menu items are under $2 anyway, I'd guess the total is not over 100 dollars though. <br/>

      One hamburger, hold the beef, with extra beans, hold the bun, add 5 taco shells in hierarchical order, oh and some lettuce I guess but not too much lettuce, you have any of that hot sauce?  Yeah I'll have a dollop or two, no, you decide what's best, and you better add some beef in there.  Actually, cancel the hot sauce, I'd prefer medium sauce and extra sour cream, and can you give me a diet root beer? No lettuce, extra onions.  Do you do mayo?  I'd like some mayo but only if the beef and beans are touching.  About that lettuce, better make it 1/3 of what I said before cause this is gonna go straight to my ass, what?  No I said my ass, hey can you add a small chalupa with 3 mild sauce packets and extra cheese.

      Reminds me of the time: <br/> 
 <br/> 
My supervisor was late back from lunch. This never happened, so we asked what was up. "It was a Burger King thing", he said. Seems he had ordered more than the available cash on hand would cover, so he took out a rare $2.00 bill that he had been saving, but happened to have in wallet. (These are an increasingly rare item, but are still  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100112110215/https://myinvestingblog.com/2008/06/26/money-hacks-carnival-18-the-history-of-money/">in circulation.</a> ) <br/> 
 <br/> 
When he presented it to the cashier, they looked at it about the way you would a space alien on fire, and then informed him that they needed legal tender, not joke bills. He insisted it was real money. After a while, the supervisor got involved. From then, it only took another ten minutes and two phone calls to decide that, yes, there is such a thing as a $2.00 bill. The supervisor had never seen one! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then on, when we were late for anything, we said it was a Burger King thing. I'll bet if I saw him today, he'd still rankle at it.

      you have to earn $7 and change to be able to spend $5 after taxes... so right away, that $5 or so that you spend on tacos could have possibly been as much as $7  that you invested pre-tax.  In 10 or 15 years, that $5 to $7 will be worth a hell of a lot more than a taco.  If you invest that amount with the frequency that some people eat at Taco Bell, you're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars.

      In 10 years, you will be very lucky to beat a doubling of your money, assuming you are doing better than 10% annualized yield, you will still be looking at about an 8% gain after taxes (if you can manage to just get hit with cap gains).  This means you double in roughly 10 years.  To get hundreds of thousands, you will need to invest over 50K of Taco Bell money, all at once.  If you amortize it over the ten years, you will run something like 70-80K on Taco Bell.  Nobody spends that much on Taco Bell. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you further consider how you must have food, and what the average meal costs a person, you need to subtract that from the cost of the Bell (it is an inflexible cost, and thus must be discounted).  In the end, eating a shitload of food at Taco Bell is a very cheap way to live, while also keeping lots of ducats for college.  The better problem to have is that you will be dead of heart failure due to your massive sodium and saturated fat intake before your children are old enough to reach college.  Or you will get a nasty, distended gut and nobody will make children with you.

      But topsy described the money as being invested pre-tax.  Assuming she's thinking of a 401(k), one factor that will help is that some companies match part or all of an employee's contributions.  Here's the quick model I just did: assuming you take the $7 you'd spend at Taco Bell every day and invest it in your 401(k), and your employer matches 50%, and you earn 7% interest annually, you'll top a hundred thousand dollars in your account at the end of year 16.  Assuming that the bulk of the matching funds are vested by then, you can then do an early withdrawl of the money, and after tax penalties you'll be able to pay for the first three weeks of your child's college education. <br/>

      true you'd have to buy more real food if you ate less fast food, but at the same time you'd also have to spend less on health care in the long term since you'd be healthier, and you'd also earn more in the long term since you'd probably be less fat if you ate less junk food.  Fat people earn less due to discrimination.  Or possibly in some individual cases because they're just plain stupid.  For eating at Taco Bell.  Ever.  I heard that in Zimbabwe the government has started a policy of grinding up the extremely morbidly obese and using them for fast food meat such as in tacos.  I'm not saying that we should go that far but it is food for thought anyway.

      Man what is with America and your insane post-secondary costs? <br/>

I'm going to end up paying less than $9,000 CND to graduate from Concordia... in Montreal. With no scholarships or financial aid from the college. And it's one of the top 400 universities in the world.

      I think lech at botte's point was that top 400 just doesn't sound impressive.  It actually is a good ranking, because there are  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100112110215/https://www.aneki.com/universities.html">many thousands</a>  of universities in the world, but "one of the top 400" just doesn't sound good in any context. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For example, <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Chocolate cake is one of my top 400 favorite foods.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Congratulations, Ms. Johnson, you were one of the top 400 applicants for this job.</em> <br/>

Get three siblings, and get your father injured at his union job but DON'T declare the Workman's Comp on the FAFSA.  Make sure your mother works a terrible job.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you do get the FAFSA in late, make sure that you have the information wrong so that you can change it later in the school year to the correct information so that they will give you the money despite the lateness. <br/> 
Make sure the FAFSA isn't late.

      Do well on a test they tell you is just for practice, then go to one of a few overpaying schools.  A not well known secret is that the PSAT is also the NMSQT.  It gets you National Merit.  Which is neat and worth a few hundred at most places, but got me full tuition, and more money than I could spend back in college.  Just gotta get into the right school.  Mine bent ever like someone's mom because of it, despite my lack of grades or morals.

      The Dark Horse strip is pretty damn solid, and I hope all these DH partnerships lead eventually to a full-color graphic novel that is on all the year-end best-of lists. With a story that begins with another great shot of Ray's mansion at night. Still, its odd that the unused dialogue on this teaser page is funnier than individual pieces of dialogue in the DHP story. Its like the ridiculous funny had to be sacrificed. I was imagining at what point the "hawk" conversation would have sprung out of. High school in the pants could have been t-shirt material.

      Peer pressured into it too. I am very disappointed, but then Pineapple Express is doing respectably at the cinemas and there is a new Harold and Kumar film out so I guess pot smoking is cool again. Newcomers would probably think it was uncool and possibly Narcish to refuse a bong so Onstad felt the need to make Beef smoke.

      As a Yankee, I was unfamiliar with the term "zimmer frame."  The first thought to cross my mind was that it must be something like a Zapruder frame.   <em>And if you advance to the next frame, you can see JFK's chin move back and to the right as he shakes his head at the hippie offering him a bong.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fortunately, Wikipedia cleared it up for me: a zimmer frame is what is called a "walker" in the US.   <em>If JFK were alive today, he'd be using a zimmer frame to walk from the Oval Office to the Lincoln Bedroom, where he'd bone your mom.</em>

      It was uncool in this very comic.  Note how Teodor came up with a creative plan (the stylized food reviews) but found himself completely unable to execute.  If he'd used cocaine instead, he'd have managed to finish the project and probably write a business plan for a carbon-neutral law firm on the side.

      I  <em>think</em>  I prefer the teaser. I love colour achewood BTW I don't know why people have a thing about it. I suspect the teaser appeals because it is a bunch of non sequiturs, and the best colour strips have been fairly nonsensical.

      Do you love to play Super Mario Brothers on the Classic Nintendo System? Do you like to get tagged from behind while you do it? This is the post for you then. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You must know your way around the game before we meet, must be open to anal sex, also able to fake an orgasm is a plus.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will send you the address to a hotel and a room number. When you arrive the door will be open. Please come in close and lock the door and close the shades if they are still open. I will be in the bathroom and the door will be closed. Turn on the TV and the Nintendo. Remove all of your clothing. Turn off all lights in the room and kneel down on the bed so you are directly in the light of the TV. You need to be facing the TV with your butt in the air pointed toward the pillows on the bed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Press the start button on the controller when you are ready. I will hear the sound and turn the light off in the bathroom and come out. You will not look directly at me, only look at the TV. When the first level starts I will begin to finger you and lick you. I will be using lots of lube as well.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
When you reach the end of level one, make sure to trigger the fireworks. This is vital to the entire experience. I must hear the fireworks. When level 2 begins and Mario walks into the pipe, I will penetrate you. You may say things like, "MORE", "HARDER", "YES", "FUCK ME", but nothing else. I will continue having sex until the level ends. DO NOT take the secret level skip. If you die I will pull out and spank you until the level restarts.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
When you reach the flag you must again trigger the fireworks, and also orgasm. I will pull out. When the 1-3 starts I will penetrate your ass. You are allowed to say something like "OH GOD", "YES", OR "IT HURTS" no other conversation is allowed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When level 1-4 starts I will alternate between holes as I see fit. You may beg me to cum inside or outside of you, depending on what you want. When boss falls and you reach the princess I will pull out and blow my load where you have convinced me I want too. You may then say something like "Thanks", "It was great", "I loved it", "Don't stop" <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I am impressed you may continue playing and I will continue to pleasure you. If I am not, I will turn the Nintendo Off and return to the bathroom. At this time you may clean your self with the towel that is beside the bed. Turn the lights on, redress yourself and leave.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I may come back out and talk to you as you dress but the conversation will most likely be short and revolve around scheduling another time to get together.

      We're Knights of the Round Table. <br/> 
We dance whene'er we're able. <br/> 
We do routines and chorus scenes <br/> 
With footwork impeccable. <br/> 
We dine well here in Camelot. <br/> 
We eat ham and jam and spam a lot. <br/>

We're Knights of the Round Table. <br/> 
Our shows are formidable, <br/> 
But many times we're given rhymes <br/> 
That are quite unsingable. <br/> 
We're opera mad in Camelot. <br/> 
We sing from the diaphragm a lot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In war we're tough and able, <br/> 
Quite indefatigable. <br/> 
Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable. <br/> 
It's a busy life in Camelot. <br/>

I have to push the pram a lot.

      <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Name and capitalization<br/>
<br/>
Cummings' publishers and others have sometimes echoed the unconventional orthography in his poetry by writing his name in lower case and without periods. Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, but according to his widow did not, as reported in the preface of one book,[1] have his name legally changed to "e e cummings". He did, however, write to his French translator that he preferred the capitalized version ("may it not be tricksy").[2] One Cummings scholar believes that on the occasions Cummings signed his name in all-lowercase, the poet may have intended it as a gesture of humility, and not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use for his name.[3]</em></div> <br/>

      You don't suck, bumpishound. You're just bbcode impaired.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't worry, it's a common condition, exacerbated by typing while drunk, and it just happens to guys every once in while. If you don't fixate on it, it will likely go away on its own, and you'll find yourself as able to perform bbcode again as you were accustomed to previously. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If, however, there is an underlying condition that is causing this mommentary impairment, and it becomes a permanent condition for you, there are some remarkable new treatments that have come available which promise a much more fulfilling existence as you simply won't give a crap anymore, and they come with only a slight - insignificant, really - chance of early onset blandness and death.

      Hey, guys, I'm back. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was a pretty swell week. There was cycling, and sun, and many flavours of ice cream (I chose mainly citrus) At one point I held Kate's hand to steady her as she reached across a low stream to take blackberries from the hedge of a local farmer. Combined with the satisfaction of the warm smile she bestowed on me in thanks, and the shared illicit pleasure of our tartly sweet spoils, it was an experience that served to warm my cockles in memory during later strife. (Water cut out, ordered taxi didn't arrive despite imminent train departure time.) I also bought a garlic pot for my time at university. <br/>

      There's not a lot going down, as far as I can tell. The main thing today is people are either on the side of "this whole thing was really great" or "this whole thing was lame and didn't feel like Achewood". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am in Camp I Really Liked It. I don't understand the haters. It seems like there will always be people to go "IT SUCKED IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS OLD ACHEWOOD WHY CAN'T PHILIPPE CONTINUE TO STAND ON IT" whenever Onstad does something a little different, even when that different thing was create an extra long comic that is pretty much made up entirely of gold. <br/>

But, hey, maybe that's just me. You can all continue telling those damn kids to get off your lawn if you want. <br/>

      I'm in the Apathetic Crowd. It wasn't totally terrible it just didn't feel like Achewood and I disagree, it wasn't GOLD it was Silver more than anything. The characters just felt off, the whole thing felt off and not at all like normal Achewood. It was more likely than not vetted to appeal to the Myspace crowd (OOO TACO BELL OOO BONGS I GET THESE JOKES LOL) who, if they come here, will find a totally different vibe and will either like it or hate it. <br/>

      I would recommend you don't write anything about Achewood, but if you really want to, I'd say maybe do something about the actual website and the success of the strip--leading up the publication of the Great Outdoor Fight book.  How one guy with some funny ideas can make it in this world, no matter what the odds!  So I guess sort of a college-writing-class-and-comedy-based version of Rudy. <br/>

Just don't write it about an arc, because that will more than likely just turn the professor off.   <br/>

It's not a real college class, it's a University of Washington writing class I'm taking in high school... our teacher acts like it's a junior high class. The guideline for the assignment was "make a claim, and then support it with evidence." Like, no shit? That's what writing is. It's a bullshit beginning of the year thing.

      Ugh yeah, I remember those terribly vague 'writing prompts' throughout school.  I always crossed my fingers for the essay/research paper topic you had to pull out of a hat.  I couldn't stand choosing my own subject matter, I'd always wrack my mind over what subject and angle would interest the person grading it.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
In that case, I guess, if your teacher is jolly, I'd go with whatever Achewood thing floats your boat.

      This class sounds a lot like the writing classes that pretty much every college in the known universe makes you take freshman year, but by taking it now, you will probably get out of that requirement.  They basically assume that nobody knows anything about writing coming into the class, and they are right often enough to support this assumption.  Once you get past freshman courses, however, it gets much better.

Maybe I should go back to my real face and hand instead of this ripped-off chicklet disguise, but it's beyond appearances.  I'm actually bored -- with the discussions, not the strip.

      I really don't see any difference from say, a month or two ago.  I don't have anyone on ignore, either.  Maybe the novelty has just worn off for you?  I've always enjoyed various forums on the internets; if you aren't otherwise a fan of the 'genre', I can see how you'd grow tired of one like Assetbar rather quickly. <br/>

Or you know, if you got engaged and your time was otherwise occupied.  Either way, too bad, but I'm having the exact same amount of fun as I ever was; which is to say, an adequate amount of fun to continue posting and reading.

      I have more time today, so I actually read it. LOL. Awesome! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Assetbar sent me a letter: "I regret to inform you that you have exceeded your chubby quotient for the day. Go home." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll be damned if it can keep me from giving you virtual chubbies. Take two or three. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glad, you have a real talent. This comes from the heart: Your way of spelling is non-standard and highly symbolic. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, and I get it's part of how you express your individuality.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said, it does present a workability issue for folks who would like to benefit from your brilliance, but who don't always have the time or aptitude to sort the message out of the apparent noise that is how it appears to uninitiated eyes.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I request that you try this on: consider that the content of your message is so individual and unique that no matter how you present it, it is still 100% you, and no one else. Consider that if you present it in "standardized" spelling, it only creates room for more people to get it, and stand in awe of your talent.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even if you post it twice, once for the cool and again for the lame, it would make a huge contribution to my enjoyment of you, and I'm sure I'm not alone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Either way, keep doing what you do. Awesome!

In a more perfect world, Assetbar would give us all like 5 chubbies to start with, and then when the comment count climbs over, say, 200, it would start giving us another one for each additional 50 comments made. Then it would be proportional to the number of possibly really good posts in existence. Wouldn't it be nice?
