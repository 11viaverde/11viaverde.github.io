      Camera pans up over crest of hill to reveal lines of desperately fighting confederate and union soldiers. It is Amercan Civil War. Soldiers fight in mud with bayonets like animals. Corpses litter the mud and the the vultures, they circle their coming feast. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jared, in uniform of southern officer, stands behind crumbling confederate line. Black-skinned union soldiers impale the last of Jared's men and begin to advance on him, eyes full of fury at the atrocities against their kinsmen that Jared embodies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jared, crying, places his officer's pistol against own temple and pulls trigger. Is no bullets; we hear click. <br/>

As grim, vengeful soldiers slowly advance on Jared, cut back and forth between crowd of eager subway customers heading to party sub platter and each cutting off chunk of sandwich.

      I actually think he already had the ideas down, and his enthusiastic reaction to T's idea of different types of deaths is just good-natured slavic style enthusiasm upon meeting a fellow with the same kind of outlook. It is a sadly western thing to say something like 'actually dude I already thought of that.'

      Jared crash-lands on desert island. He is alone and swept by winds and waves. Time lapses; he grows a beard and loses his shirt. By the end he is stripped to a loincloth, emaciated. As the camera pans over his skeletal form taking its last breath, cut back to images of healthy, attractive woman working out and eating Subway Fresh Fit combo.

      Jared sleeps in his bed. A gentle creak is heard somewhere in the house. Perhaps it is the house settling? The creak nears. Jared's eyes open, look left, look right. He breaks into a cold sweat. Quickly, he rises from his bed and sneaks towards his closet, from which he can see the moonlight entering his doorway. He awaits a shadow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The mask of a ninja materialises silently from behind him, rising up to become visible over his shoulder. Without a word of warning the ninja brings his sword up and beheads Jared. Cut back and forth from head rolling on floor to ingredients for Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki bouncing in that white, sterile space used in all Subway ads.

      Jared is in an ancient temple, Indiana Jones style. He sets off a trap and a giant boulder is released from the roof, and cut to Jared running down a hallway. As the boulder gets closer and closer, cut back and forth between someone making a Meatball Marinara sub.

      Jared is in tighter than should be white wife beater, starink in bathroom mirror. He hates what mirror shows him; it also shows insides, which are totally like wiener. He grits teeth with sadness and hate, and realizes this makes him look more like wiener. Jared is then turnink on shower, opens window, and falls to death nine stories.

      This is easily (one of) my favorite strips.  I say "one of" only because I'm sure there's other ones I'm not thinking of right now, but I'm 98% certain this is The One.

      Jared returns to the town of his youth, now barren and decrepit.  What seems like a thousand of years ago a child-killer once terrorized these empty streets, abducting his victims under the cloak of darkness.  Fear and desperation had driven everyone away, but Jared has returned to finally face the memories that have haunted him so long. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He slowly approaches the ramshackle wooden flophouse where the killer once lived, the scene of the grisly murders that defied comprehension.  There is a rusted tricycle still laying in the yellowed grass of the front lawn; a spoke slowly turns in the wind.  He walks through the door, noting in the broken windows that seemed to beckon the eyes to penetrate the secrets within.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Inside it is silent save the wind whistling through rotten boards and the flapping an upstairs shutter.  The walls are covered in obscene and mystifying graffiti like paleolithic cave paintings.  Jared stops a second to pick something off the floor, an old book with faded print. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Suddenly, an inhuman slam crashes from overhead, as something or someone pounds down on the ceiling; Jared is instantly covered in sheets of floating dust and drops the book, trying to run but only collapsing helplessly to the ground.  As the killer returned to claim one last victim?  Or had he never actually left? <br/> 
 <br/> 
As the weighty footsteps slowly beat down the stairs, cut from a shot of Jared's visage of abject terror as he prepares to finally face the truth, to a shot of his realization of how much weight loss is possible with a diet plan at Subway.
