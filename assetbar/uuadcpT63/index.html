      this was a tactical mistake, manflesh.  Until three people come along who have spam marking privileges, innumerable people will be forced to ignore you in order to read anything else on this page.  This means that you've managed to ensure that very few people will be able to see your comments for quite a while.  I'm sorry to see you so tragically blunder.

      You know, you're right.  This comic is amazing.  It's the reason I'm here.  And when I get here, I sometimes like to read what other people thought of it too.  And when some jerk-off puts several dozen pictures of puppies in the way that I have to scroll past, it makes the experience less pleasant.  Yes, it's an inconvenience, and it's irritating.  I'm sorry you feel that because it's on the internet, my complaint is invalid. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyhow, I'm with you on the new color strips.  When he eventually goes back to B&W, I will still love those, but for now, I'm enjoying the trip.  I don't know for sure, but I don't think they're guest pieces.  It seems like it started as a Chris Ware homage, but this one seems less like that, and more just like original brilliant weirdness.

      Actually, I think this one is much more Ware-esque than the preceding strips. It's so Chris Ware it's barely even Achewood.

      True. Unfortunately this strip elicited a 2 from me for that very reason. I'm unfamiliar with Ware's work, so this doesn't strike home for me at all. I'm sure people who like Ware would find this an excellent homage to Mr Ware and quite clever, but to me, it's just a bunch of off-the-wall randomness that I have no particular interest in decoding. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That being said, both of the other homage strips got 5's from me, so it's not like the entire exercise is bunk (in my eyes, at least).

      With all do respect, Mr. Snowman, I think you've missed why this is important to us.  The good doctor was not always as you see him now.  He was once the bright, promising rising star of this commentboard.  His fall is something like Milton's Paradise lost; tragic but probably inevitable.  People have not shut the fuck up about Milton in how many hundred years?  I think we've all earned-nay, we all NEED, a public forum to discuss this turn of events.  <br/>

      I thought it was a play on words. It still could be, but it's more ambiguous in American English. In England, we spell it "story" (tale), and "storey" (level of a building). <br/>

Having checked on dictionary.com, I feel slightly cheated by the international politics of standardised spelling...

      On one hand, perhaps I was a bit tense last night.  I have been out job hunting - but I was meeting with success, so I wouldn't say that was it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps it was due to the fact that I met with instant opposition and a little bit of douche-baggery, partly due to not being recognised and so seen as an "outsider" that they must defend the sanctity of Acheworld against.  I hold Acheworld in high stead myself, so I can understand this, being an obsessively interactive resident of the community.  But it's interesting how different one gets treated due to such a small change. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps also, constant repeating footage of Edward Norton punching himself in the boat race is making me feel tense.  Perhaps I just don't like it.  Either way, I miss Ash.  The arrogance and stupidity I can convey through his sempiternal nodding sequence.  I miss his smile, I miss his laugh, I miss his musk.  Hell, I'm a mess without him.  I think that after this is all over, we should get an apartment together.  Maybe I should just...stop talking for a while.* <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, as shit and lame as it may be to recant on my avatar change, and particularly to jabber on about it like this, I'm changing back. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, if this were feasible to have as an avatar, I would do it in a heartbeat: <br/>

There was something else I was meaning to write, but so help me, I can't think of it. <br/>

The fake nose thing is, for a robot, amusing. I found the dialogue between the 'frig and vlad to be hilarious and clever because I haven't seen anyone breach the topic between "sentient" robots and "non-sentient" in this way. Whats truly hilarious is that Onstad's portrayal of the refrigerator is rather keen, more so then even science fiction authors or modern movie makers.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Robots won't be noble slaves and shit at first. They will have stupid texan accents and think its your birthday every single day. I mean, every day man? come on. That doesn't even make sense. <br/>

      Sorry to nitpick, but I don't think the majority of Acheworld users lame someone just for not liking a strip. It seems to be more a small group who can't grow up. Interestingly, I've noticed that while many users will defend a person who criticizes a strip, it's very rare for a lamer to actually try to justify laming someone with well thought complaints.

I was not a massive fan of this one - previous homages have been great, I also really like Chris Ware's work too - but long may the guy experiment. When there are big lengthy arcs, or just one-off strips - they've all been handled brilliantly. To me, this is just a case similar to when a band covers a song that is really personal to them but it doesn't quite translate over. <br/>

      I gotta agree. While I love experimentation, and this fun leap into color is a nice change of pace, I don't know much of anything about Chris Ware nor do I understand this particular comic at all. I'm sure I'm missing something here, something deeply profound and odd, for which I'm a little ashamed. But, generally, I'm lost, too. Not a criticism of Onstad as much as a commentary on me, I guess.

Like a lot of people here, I didn't know much about the Chris Ware thing, but with a little bit of help from Google and Wikipedia I managed to quite enjoy the previous strips in this arc. This one though, is just over my head.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Does a greater knowledge of Chris Ware help here, or is the humour just a bit too oblique for a simple creature like me?

      I know about Chris Ware but have never actually read him. (OK, some Jimmy Corrigan, once. That's all, I promise) <br/>

I found all of these to be funny. They are just kind of bizarre, surreal. It's not as funny as seeing a cat's penis, true, but it's more just a funny situation with our favorite characters... a robot hates his fridge (also a robot), and a man gets a job via nepotism. Not that deep. Just kind of funny.

      When the PT Cruiser first came out I was excited. Not necessarily by the car per se, although I did like it at the time. No, I was more excited because it was change. To me, there was essentially a couple types of cars, and every car fit neatly into one of those molds. "Bold new looks" as car companies advertised were a few sleaker lines here and there, if that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The PT Cruiser was change that kept us from the stagnmant pool that was current car designs, whether you liked it or not. What's more, the designs success lead to other, strange vehicles being produced. And as people complained about how ugly they were (I mean, seriously, the Aztek?) I just said it was all for the greater good, promoting variety. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is what I think of when Onstad deviates from the regular format of the strip. Doing the exact same thing every day is just plain boring, for both the reader and the artist. Whether I like a new thing Onstad is doing or not, I appreciate that the variety is good, and, if the experiment is successful, can lead to greater things in the future.

      My guess it that it has always been there. Achewood is characterised mainly because of their characters evolution. Change is kind of the whole point of the strip, but sometimes that change is... Well, not what we expect.

      Oh, naturally. Achewood is as a writhing veil; subtle inconsistencies are its hallmark. But this...this is different. The shift is more underlying, more fundamental. Perhaps I haven't been here long enough, perhaps I haven't experienced the full ebb and flow of Acheworlder subculture sufficiently enough to forecast and prophecize, but my intuition tells me that forces are in motion unlike any before them, and I fear are perhaps better left to rest.

      My thoughts exactly. Change in Achewood is to be expected. Hell, it's essential for the stablished characters to evolve. It's the highlight of the strip, the pinnacle of its mastery. But... Well, even Achewood, as surreal and ridiculous as it can get, is subject to certain laws that can't be violated. These animals are basically people. People are quite unpredictable, but not absolutely random. Take Ray, for example, he is fundamentally charming and proud, whereas Roast Beef has a completely different mindset. That doesn't mean that Roast Beef can't be assertive from time to time, but you won't see him living in a mansion any time soon. <br/> 
But these last strips... I don't know. It's not that they contradict past Achewood mythos (is that word correctly used?), but they seem to be so far-fetched and outlandish that I can't quite enjoy them as much. That doesn't mean I hate them, and I'm sure I'll eventually get used to them, and appreciate them for what they are: a brief reccess on the daily progress of Acheworld.

      That section of the strip is ace, I agree.  The Teodor bit might have been saved for another occasion, sure, but folks might consider taking a few deep breaths.  The punchline for this strip, as far as I'm concerned, is folks who seem convinced, after three strips worth of mildly experimental strips, that Achewood Can Never Be Good Again. <br/>

Oh, and miseryand...?  Look once more at the panels where the fridge is unplugged, and ask yourself, "Did he jump, or was he Sisyphushed?"

      The Microsoft tangent derails this one a bit--it'd end right well with CHUCK WAGON SUPPLIERS.  The other feels like it's from the next strip over. <br/>

Also, what the hell accent is that fridge sporting?  Sand'mawich is not a usual jovial accentual way of handling "sandwich."  Also, it seems that accentual is a word--but does it mean what I'm trying to make it mean?  Only time will tell.

      I agree.  It's strange to say it, but normal achewood is more coherent than this.  These strips are like those dreams where random shifts of setting occur every few minutes, which are not worth remembering.  Normal Achewood is a better brand of surrealism.

      Same here. I've been a big fan of Chris Ware's stuff for years, and obviously I'm a big fan of Achewood, but that doesn't mean I automatically want to see them crammed together. I like fish and I like candy, but if someone offered me cod-flavored Skittles I think I'd decline.

      I didn't see it as the shadow right away, myself.  Possible reason: the planet (we believe it to be round) should also have some shading for the building shadow to be where it is.  The brain works on a lot of stuff behind the scenes, but is easily confused.  Mine is still working on Teodor's outfit and duties at Microsoft.  Two days between strips is really too long for ...THOCK!

      Is it sad that, because I thought the apartment block towering over the Earth was probably unnecessary hyperbole, I went and did the maths? The average storey works out at 3 metres, more or less, so a million storey building would be at 3,000,000 metres, or 3,000 km, which is shorter than most of the world's mountains - https://topratings.wordpress.com/2007/09/11/top-ratings-top-100-highest-mountain-peaks-in-the-world/
