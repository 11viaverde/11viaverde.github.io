      My favorite Chick tract I've ever actually received is called  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144550/https://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0099/0099_01.asp/">"The Party Girl,"</a>  where Satan lays a trap for a girl through Marti Gras. Another great one is  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144550/https://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0046/0046_01.asp/">"Dark Dungeons,"</a>  about the dangers of D&D. <br/>

      Oh, Dark Dungeons - man, that one is a  <em>classic</em> .  Chick makes me kinda ill. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Speaking of which, did you ever hear of Tom Hanks' first movie, about the dangers of D&D?   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144550/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazes_and_Monsters">Looks more entertaining than anything he's done recently.</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Back onto Chick though - having viewed his website, his new stuff isn't as good.  I mean, the gospel message is there and all, sure, but dude - comparisons to Exodus?  I can get that anywhere, man!  I come to you for conspiracy about the Catholic church being in league with Satan!  I wanna hear how rock music is  <em>still</em>  bad, and about the various demons that inhabit me from playing video games!  He's off his game, I tell you.

Now, while he was obviously joking with the "Unamerican" jibe, playing sarcastically on feelings of the past - I still think it smacks of old-school stereotyped American ignorance of the rest of the world being here too, as he was making a joke that was relevant purely to other Americans and not to anyone else.  And there's no need for that shit.  But still, he was obviously joking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
NOTE: I ain't saying that all Americans are like that.  If I honestly believed that, then it wouldn't be a stereotype, would it?  Most Americans I've met are way cool.  But given that there's 300 million people there and they're the most culturally influential country in the world at the moment*, there's naturally gonna be some whackos. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Besides, despite being an Aussie, I was raised and went to elementary school in the US, so possibly I might have a right to internally criticise  <strong>both</strong>  countries.  And maybe even England, too! <br/> <br/> <br/> *For the last 100 years, anyway.  Rome was That Country for like 500 years.  Give China 50 years before they are That Country again.  Seriously.

But now I have to refrain from pointing out that the word our esteemed  <strong>drskradley</strong>  used in the first sentence of his second paragraph should have been "gibe". <br/>

      Descriptivism, my friends! Know it, love it. Just because something is an Americanism doesn't make it  <em>wrong.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, whether or not an Americanism qualifies as  <em>standard usage</em>  on a forum with members from many English-speaking countries is another argument. I try to avoid turns of phrase I know to be impenetrable to non-Americans, but being American, sometimes I don't know which those  <em>are.</em>

And yes, 100 years - give or take a few decades.  Certainly no more than 150 years.  America wasn't the huge cultural influence it is now before the Industrial Revolution.  France and England were jostling for such power, and had been for years.  China was struggling to enter into this brave new Western world, scared of losing their perceived cultural superiority.  Germany was a major source of culture, particularly in the field of arts and humanities. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But America was still in its infancy.  The economies of the North and South were coming together as one after the Civil War, but they weren't leading the fucking world by any means.  So yes, 100-odd years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Australia was still, essentially, a colony.  We were still the children of convicts and people who had no other choice but to come down to Terra Australis.

      I disagree -- the American cultural invasion of the rest of the world began when other countries began to emulate our business models and industrial practices -- roughly the 1880s, when it became apparent we would soon be the richest country in the world, gained steam after our intervention ended WWI and gained steam again when Hollywood began exporting movies (roughly, 1925).

Son of a bitch!  There are others big-headed meat-eating theropods with the wee little hands deal, but basically the only ones with two fingers are tyrranosaurids.  Even fucking Gigantosaurus has three fingers!  And he doesn't need them any more than the other guys.  Guess becuase he was earlier in the Cretaceous, so not as evolutionarily specialised. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Albertosaurus, Alioramus, Appalachiosaurus, Tarbosaurus, Gorgosaurus - all two fingers, all tyrannosaurids.  Not necessarily Tyrannosaurus himself, but all tyrannosaurids. <br/>

At least you learned one more thing about yourself prior to death.  As Socrates said, the unexamined life is not worth living. <br/>

      Huh, I'm drinking Twining English Breakfast right now. <br/>

Still, when it actually comes to tea, I usually refer people to Douglas Adams's stance on tea:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144550/https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A61345">https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A61345</a> <br/>

I've never actually had tea this way, but that doesn't mean that the process he describes is both enjoyable and sounds like harbors fucking delicious results.

      What? You pour tepid water on a teabag and hope for the best? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, he's wrong about the milk. If you put the milk in first your tea will be a crappy mix of hot water and milk, and when agitated, clouds of brown will billow through that pale mix. <br/>

There's a reason he made his fortune as a writer, not a Chai-wallah.

      So does that make my statement "Reductio ad asherdanum"? This is not the first time I have seen such things in response to lame posts, and not just by me.  Maybe it's like a weird acheworld version of Godwin's law.  If so, I propose we name it Thorfinn's law, after me, the person who first made the observation.  As a conversation on lame posts and those who leave them increases in length, the probability of an asherdan comparison approaches 1.

      I always read clear to the bottom, then chubby my way back to the top, ensuring that my chubbies only go to the comments that were truly deserving, but that occasionally backfires as well, because sometimes people post chubby worthy things a day or two after the comic, and my chubbies have all been used.  I think that instead of a strict 5 chubbies per strip, you should be allowed 1 more per 25 comments.  So today, with 140 comments so far, you would be allowed the base 5, plus 5 more (140/5, rounded down), for a total of 10.  This would greatly help to alleviate the chubby shortage that so many of us have been hit by

      that, sir, is a very good idea (imo).  i think assetbar developers read the comments on this page:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144550/https://martini.assetbar.com/beta_comments">https://martini.assetbar.com/beta_comments</a>  regarding assetbar features.  would you submit it?   <br/>

      My advice to Ray is stick with coffee.  We went to the trouble of having a revolution to get rid of tea and teadrinkers.  Drinking tea is just like pissing on Alexander Hamilton's grave. <br/>

That having been said, I went through a gourmet tea phase last year.  It was fun, and my blood pressure went down 20 points.  In the end, though, I just need my 8-12 cups of coffee a day to function.  This is how we are as a people; it's not our fault.

      So randomly... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let's say someone was doing something pretentious and terrible, like writing a paper about apathy and melancholy and just all around sadsackery, and one particular focus was multi-media and combined artforms, like words mixed with pictures (a comic, perhaps one on the internet, would be a good example). <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, in saying this (terrible) thing, what strips might be best to look at in terms of just raw sadness?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or maybe I should just ask what are the best Roast Beef strips?

      "What's a good tea to like?" Not, what tea would I like, or what is a good tea. It's as if Ray has dispensed with the idea of consuming things for any other reason than the value they'd bring to his already pretty expensive lifestyle. What tea should I settle on as my tea, he's really asking, as a lifestyle accessory, as an accoutrement to my other things that I like, which, taken as a whole define me in ways my actual personality never can. Yet, in a way, you could say that this is just a defining characteristic OF his personality; he is obsessed with every shimmering and shifting surfaces - who am I to say this is any less deep than appreciation of the actual taste of tea?
