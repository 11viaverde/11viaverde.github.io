      I've tried pot twice (my only excursions into the world of recreational drugs) and I think I must be bad at it or something. The first time I got rather paranoid and refused to answer the phone or open the door, and the second time I just felt super-sad and stared catatonically at a wall while my friends played with a strobe light. :(

      Even if it don't get chubbies, I gotta report.   The first time I smoked pot, it was off a friend's vaporizer.   First it burned my throat something awful.   Then I threw up six times in his bathroom.   Then I paranoided that he was gonna do me in.   Then I came outta the bathroom and he was asleep.   I woke him up, and he didn't make any sense.   Then I ran home, demonic riffs playing in my brain, and sought solace in the understanding arms of my girl.   She saved my life, it seemed like, that night.

      Also keep in mind that cats have mild hallucinations to begin with anyway. I suspect that pot would enhance those hallucinations to cater to that particular cat's, in this case Roast Beef's, personality.  <br/>

Then again, I'm no expect on cat reactions to drugs...I've only seen dogs high.

      I remember some good firsts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My first time, I got high with a new buddy and some guys I just met (one of them went on to be the drummer for second system). We smoked out of a coffee can turned into a bong. Suddenly another guy who i later became friends with, comes busting in the door wearing a yellow hat, yellow shirt, and yellow pants, takes a few rips off the bong, and speeds off. that was a trip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My cousin's first time, we made him smoke two dimes to himself, he was so wasted he sat down in this rocking chair and was literally glued to it. He said it felt like he was going 300mph in this chair and didn't know what the hell.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
first and last time trying PCP, it was laced in a few joints I bought at a concert, it was fucking magical. I got my bone on in the woods behind the hall with what I can only describe as a gothic amazon, which i didn't find out about until I got a call from her the next morning, and called my buddy to find out i snuck off in the woods with this chick in the middle of the show and when I came back I was "Skipping and hopping with this giant smile on your face" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then i preceded to see some freaky shit. A giant pink rabbit, like a guy in a rabbit costume, only it was pink. Superman with a purple afro, and a goblin who decided to start punching the shit out of me during which I just kept saying "Whats going on, is this guy hitting me? why is he hitting me". Turns out it was some mousy kid who was blitzed off his gord, and he really was hitting me but I just couldn't feel it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then at around 3 in the morning, I finally get home, still not sure how, and I played blitz football on my PS2, only for the guy I was controlling to stop, turn around, look at me, and start talking about bill gates.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I ate a swiss cake roll and went to sleep, and never touched the stuff since.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also the first time i tried coke involved setting a friends reclining chair on fire after carrying it behind a liquor store.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Drugs are bad. I just stick to cigarettes and booze now because of this.

      You know, personally, I never felt that Beef is frightened of the skeleton or that it's brought on by weed paranoia. I think his reaction is closer to "Oh gracious, I never imagined that such as a simple songbird could know how to rock so hard." It's like heavy metal is what songbirds hear when they are singing to each other, and with weed Beef has let himself in on their secret.
