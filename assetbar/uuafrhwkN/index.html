      Yeah, me too. I was really surprised at the time, since I'd only been reading for a couple months, and also it was the first (last? last.) time a webcomic made me feel any attachment to its comics. I'd like for this comment to be funny, but honestly, I'm just in awe that Achewood can be even half what it is, sort of like Ted Leo. Simple components, the same ideas a bunch of times over, but it's always fuckin' terrific.

      One time my uncle was walking through the woods. Another man started walking with him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My uncle looked at the man, and the man looked at my uncle. That man was afraid of my uncle, and my uncle was afraid of that man. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But they kept walking and came to a darker part of the woods. My uncle looked at the man, and the man looked at my uncle. That man was VERY afraid of my uncle and my uncle was VERY afraid of that man. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But still they kept walking until they could hardly see anything. My uncle looked at the man, and the man looked at my uncle. The man was TERRIBLY afraid of my uncle, and my uncle was TERRIBLY afraid of that man. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*NOW SCREAM!* <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is the story that this strip reminded me of.

      After the story about the screaming the conversation really went downhill.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I bet Phillippe is really wishing he was more talky now.
