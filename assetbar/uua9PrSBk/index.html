      One wonders if being profoundly stoned and playing sports is something of a recurring theme in the Onstad household. Perhaps on his child's 18th they will burn one and go curling at an ice rink while people fall down due to both their lack of skill and a giant polished granite rock smashing their legs from under them. Good times.

      yeah man, I threw up for the first time about a week ago . . .  as I was smoking my throat kinda dryed up, and got coated with mucus, till I wasn't getting enough air, like 3/4 as much as I needed with each breath . . then my diaphragm started heaving, and I threw up four times.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The funny thing is, it cleaned my throat out, and I still felt great afterwards.

Outside on a hot September afternoon, not in a secure basement with excited friends at midnight like the first time but in an uptight neighborhood on a back patio at like 2:30 PM with a friend and three people I didn't know. Girl didn't offer any water, starting fucking with my head after her mom  <strong>and her grandmother</strong>  came home like half an hour into it. "What? No, she's not home." *Concerned face* "Are you feeling all right, Steve?"

      After thinking about it I may have spoke too soon. Nothing really compares to the first watch-through of Dead Alive. The last twenty minutes of Audition are pretty rough and the unrated version of Ichi the Killer is pretty brutal. Meet the Feebles disturbed me in a major way but still I think Dead Alive tops them all.

      When I'm stoned driving on the highway I can go two hundred miles without looking at the road or thinking about what I'm doing. It seems extremely efficient and it makes for a pleasant enough ride (another side effect is that I never break 60 mph), but it's probably not a good thing.

      I rode as a passenger (while high) in a car with a woman (first problem am I right hahaha oh I kill me) who was also high, and that crazy bitch started driving in the opposing traffic lane straight toward an oncoming car and I had to wrench the wheel away from her and goddammit I'm never getting in a car with a stoned woman ever again.

      I live in BC and our bud is nothing special. Side note: despite my distaste for that most noxious of intoxicating weeds, marijuana, I have found my reflexes and instincts are hugely improved. I've never driven stoned, but I assume I would be great at it. I am frankly amazing at stoned video games.

      Ray would make an awesome EMT.  Ambulance rolls up to the scene, sirens wailing.  Ray jumps out of the door holding his medical kit before the vehicle has even come to a complete stop.  He rushes to the victim, clearing a path through the crowd of onlookers.  He kneels over the stricken person, looks him in the eyes, and asks, "You're lying in the middle of the sidewalk, and you're turning blue.   <em>How come?</em> " <br/> 
 <br/> 
Meanwhile, Beef waits in the back of the van because he's "basically in no condition to deal with situations of mortality.  What if I try to open his shirt to take his vitals and his wallet drops out of a coat pocket?  Falls open to reveal pictures of the man's wife and three kids, all looking up at me with their eyes asking 'When is daddy coming home?'" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I could totally go for a version of  <em>Emergency!</em>  with Ray and Beef working alongside John and Roy.

      It seems like it makes you see the strip from Beef's perspective, almost. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You know if you're in a semi-conscious drunken (/stoned?) stupor and people in the room are talking about you? 'Whoa how much has he had', 'Let's draw a moustache on him', and so forth? And it's like, you can hear them, but they're a long way away and what they're talking about is no real concern of yours? It's the visual equivalent of that. Hence Beef NOT being in silhouette at the end. I reckon.
