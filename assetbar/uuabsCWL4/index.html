      Agreed. I hate how "The Post War Dream" starts to sound good, but 30 seconds later it suddenly grinds to a halt and segues into what is mostly crap until "Not Now John". It would be a good album if you cut out all the filler, but then it'd only be about 10 minutes long.

      I was mostly looking for an excuse to post links to www.thebricktestament.com, but I guess no excuse is needed for something this awesome.  Here are a few awesome passages <br/>

Pretty much the whole damn thing is awesome, but if you don't want to go through the whole thing, the sections on Samson and the sections on the 10 plagues of Egypt are the best.

      The Brick Testament guy impressed me with his frank and accurate portrayal of the Bible.  The comedy was in the absurdity of the idea, and as such, it was classy to not go into parody of such things as the crucifixion, treating everything with respect, and one's own beliefs can view the passages as self-parody if you are in that way inclined.  Well done, that dude.

      This is exactly what persuaded me to take a (fourth) stroll through the entire archives.  Reading The Math made me all nostalgic and I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything (I wasn't).

It took a pretty nasty world to produce Devo. You might think we got the long end of the stick, but they've got the Tenmen.

      Yah. I was a slut for Rock. Mainly local Australian acts and a few internationals similarly themeed. I like the groove but I could never get into 80's production. So many great tunes were ruined by snare hits that would echo so hard you'd hear it into the next song.

      once upon a time, my favorite cousin left a silver tape onto which was recorded a Chicago station (Q101) and they played really good alternative. this was back in the latter half of the '90s and one summer he took it back to Chicago with him and i was really bummed and then made it my mission to recreate it with all the songs i could remember off of it. <br/>

      Well. You can get updates sent to your mobile, but they're not as appealing as they sound. There's a whole separate place from here with strip previews, descriptions of events in real time, yadda yadda. Whenever it gets updated over there, you can get a text message with a brief description of what the update entails. But in order to do all of that, you have to pay some money. Which I did.

      <em>woodenteeth's initial happiness transformed subtly, but quickly, into an inability to further enjoy cinema. Or to go outside. Or to think. <br/>

Phillip Seymour Hoffman first began replacing every actor woodenteeth saw -- but now he replaced </em> everything <em>. woodenteeth spent a few days hoping to adjust to this new world, but a mere hour after buying groceries from Phillip Seymour Hoffman and hearing "Turn, Turn, Turn" (re-recorded by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) played over the grocery-store speaker system, woodenteeth fled home, ignoring his Phillip Seymour Hoffman neighbors, and locked himself away.<br/>

      Okay, true story. I was so convinced that Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character in The Big Lebowski was actually played by Matt Damon in a fat suit that I bet money on it, and promptly lost it when the credits rolled. I don't thin it was [i]such[i/] a daft suggestion, considering I had no idea who this Seymour Hoffman chap was at the time, but still it is perhaps slightly unwise to bet five quid on a character being played by Matt Damon in a fat suit when noone in the room had ever heard that Matt Damon was even in the film...

      I think it is more that the presence of Little Nephew irritates Taffy into being a bit more than a twitching rubber-brained thing.  Little Nephew, on the other hand, appears to be jealous of Taffy's prowess with the videoed games.  This relationship can only begin in tears and end in blood.

      I love how Iorwerth is basically saying: "You don't care about anything on this green Earth, do you, Ray?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
And Ray's response, while it could be taken as a question, is instead punctuated with an exclamation point, meaning he either is just exhaling in a "WOW, what a thing to say! How do I respond?" or, he's lost in his own world, barely listening to Iorweth, just making noise to fill a gap in the conversation, like a crappy new rap-indie-rockabilly crossover band trying to tell Ray about their ideas for a world tour, while Ray is mulling how he can make enough in merchandising to cover the cash he dropped on signing them...   <br/>

      Nice Pete is roaring with impotent rage at his inability to form a proper speech-type presentation of the esteemed wine... but his roar is overpowered by the stylings of the Tenmen as they start to play at a much greater volume, drowning him out. The notes match - so in the panel with the Tenmen playing, Nice Pete is screaming in the background at the time that they're playing those notes, but no one hears him. The wedding continues blissfully unaware.

      It depends, really. I've actually built a replica of an old flintlock, and a lot them have a "half-cock" and a "full-cock" stage. Rolling all the way through from hammer down to full-cock would give two clicks, and "ch-chk" is as easy a way as any to represent that onomatopoetically.

I initially read that as DOGG and for a brief second thought that Onstad had specifically encoded this hidden message in his choice of wine.

      Also, I never quite understood this notion that anything that tastes sweet and light is "amateur" and "piss" and somehow being a connoisseur requires liking things that are bitter and dry.

      There's a touch of elitism in it.  Mostly, semi-snobs like me enjoy wine with some complexity.  Asti (at least the two brands I've tried) is simple, and has a nasty bitter finish on it.  Sweet isn't always bad, and probably the most impressive wine I've ever had was a sweet one (Y'quiem).  Real snobs of course don't let anything under a hundo touch their tongues.  I mostly stick around $20-$30, which I consider the sweet spot for cost/taste.  Though again, your statement that a certain degree of elitism exists is well founded.  Wine has always existed so that some people could look down at other people for totally pointless reasons

      Yea I mean I've never tried Asti, but I've had other Moscato wines and found them pleasing, though I can't remember which. And a good Riesling is pretty much heaven as far as I'm concerned. But again, I am in no position to make claims. I went on a wine tour in Bordeaux last summer and I couldn't help but feeling like it was mostly wasted on me, since I generally don't like reds and the only one that really made an impression on me was the Sauternes.

      I'm going to have to yield to the wisdom of John Cleese in these matters (I can't remember the name of the program, but he hosted a show about wines).  Don't let anyone else tell you what wine you should like.  If you like riesling and asti, drink riesling and asti, there is no right or wrong when it comes to wine selection, just personal preference.

      I'm deeming you "wine-cool" on a probationary license.  A good dry-ish Riesling is a wonderful thing.  I know at least one old man on these boards who would agree.  And a great Sauternes is one of my favorite things.  That super-high-end thing I mentioned above is the finest of Sauternes, and the best drink I've ever had

      There's a story to the Brasi character's famous "...on the day of your wedding" rehearsal. Apparently that scene was added to the script to reflect that actor's own comical anxiety at doing a scene with Marlon Brando and flubbing all of his lines.

      I'm pretty sure that the man playing Luca Brasi was actually a genuine wiseguy who was cast in the role for authenticity (maybe even to mollify the real mob, who weren't entirely thrilled about the book being made into a film). <br/> <br/> <br/> Hence his inability to act, and the fact that they included candidly shot footage of his (real) nervous rehearsal in the final cut as one of the few 'genuine' moments they got from him.

      IMDB has Lenny Montana as a wrestler-turned-actor.  <br/>

Wikipedia (and a BBC docu) say he was a mobster as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The same documentary stated that the rehearsal scene was written in later, but that the footage was of Montana sitting to one side of the wedding scene and practicing his lines, not acting as Brasi practicing his lines (for all the difference it makes).

      You mean the fish that I...   <em>boned</em> ?  I actually always feed loneal later.  In her sleep.  I'm convincing her that she is starving.  I think it's good for her morale.  Also it makes certain that she'll eat enough.  Damn girl looks like she needs twenty sandwiches.

      Nice Pete knows the three rules of proper wedding guest etiquette: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1.) Give a gift that will be useful at all times with all things. Example: A wine that you could drink now or later, with chicken or steak or friends or beer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2.) Prepare a heartfelt speech for gift delivery. If necessary, find a secluded corner in which to practice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And, most importantly: <br/> 
 <br/> 
3.  <em>Do not outdress the groom.</em>  If the groom will wear short sleeves and a tie, do not show him up by involving sleeves in the matter.

      Looking up Chamonix, I was at first impressed that an entire town in France had Ray's credit card on file. Impressed, but not surprised.  <br/>

 <em>Classic Ray</em> . <br/>

Then, upon deeper observation, I discovered it was also the name of a resort in the aforementioned town.  <br/>

I'm pretty sure I prefer the first interpretation.

what does the future portend...  maybe at some point Onstad will be all like, screw it, lol, I's going to do mostly prose.. and it will become a book with mere illustrations here and there... <br/> 
 <br/> 
will he go to flash? <br/> 
 <br/> 
will he go to flash with all the laborious frame tweaking done in a sweatshop in Bangalore or a Detroit second world suburb? <br/>

Man if I was Onstad, at some point I'd take my Achewood world, and slap it on a visa app to France.  Get out of this dump, you know.
