      No, he gets gout from eating at that deli too much (he then is too fat to goto the prom). <br/>

Eating lutefisk causes him to burn down the church (which is funny because that's what Norwegian black metallers do and lutefisk is a Nordic dish so wow this has come full circle really).

      I am originally from El Paso, Texas. El Paso is 90 pervent hispanic. In Mexican culture it is very, very taboo to mess with the handicapped or the sick. Making fun of someone for a disability would get you beat the fuck up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The city is full of gangsters, many of which would just as soon stab you as look at you, and many passersby wouldn't even care. But these same gangsters and passersby would beat you till they broke their hands if you messed with a disabled person. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I moved to Nebraska and heard people make fun of the handicapped students I was mortified. That would not stand where I came from.

      Part of my teacher certification included a special education class that you could test out of taking if you passed a ridiculous multiple choice test about dealing with handicapped people.  One of the questions was "T/F--You should talk to every person in a wheelchair as though they are mentally retarded".  This is the kind of rigorous testing you have to undergo to be allowed to teach children.

      Well... Dvorak wrote Symphony #9 "From the New World" after being inspired on trip to... Iowa, of all places.  Despite its title, however, the melodic and harmonic material of the symphony is very Slavic in nature.  If anything, it's a homesickness piece: Dvorak recalling fond slavic memories and writing the piece FOR his Slav homeland "from the New World."

It does still beat the crap out of almost everything else though. <br/>

      I really, really wish that I did not hate Nightwish so much. It makes it hard for me to spend time with a lot of my friends. They're going "Ooooooh listen to this track, it's beautiful! It's like they wrote it for meeeeee!" and I'm sitting there thinking "I thought self indulgent operatic rock died out in 86?". I can't bring myself to lie to them, and I can't tell them what I really think. It just ends with me sitting there in steely silence which is actually kind of worse than the other two options. <br/>

I was sad to hear about the Stratovarius split though. Not really my scene but they did some pretty decent stuff.

Motorhead,  <strong>Ridin' With The Driver</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Iron child out of Vulcans forge, metal scream and thrash <br/> 
Red steel in the driving wheel, hear the pistons clash <br/> 
Dragon breathin' big black smoke, howlin' up the tracks <br/> 
 <br/> 
[Chorus] <br/> 
I'm ridin' on the Thunderchief, spit in the devil's eye <br/> 
No force on earth can stop me now <br/> 
Like to see 'em try <br/> 
Hey, hey ridin' with the Driver <br/> 
 <br/> 
Juggernaut comin' down the line, hear the banshee cry <br/> 
Engineer like to lose his mind. glory in his eye <br/> 
Too fast to live this way, too young to die <br/> 
 <br/> 
[Repeat chorus] <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hold tight, feel the drivers bite, hear the whistle moan <br/> 
Engine rockin' to the left and right, vibratin' in my bones <br/> 
Once the locomotive steals your soul, you got a Casey Jones <br/> 
 <br/> 
[Chorus] <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm ridin' on the Thunderchief, spit in the devil's eye <br/> 
No force on earth can hurt me now, kiss your ass goodbye <br/> 
My my, ridin' with the Driver

      What I love about those concerts is that everyone is wearing earplugs, including the band and sound guys. If they just pulled the level down 20dB everyone could pull them out and the concert would sound much better. <br/>

But yeah, seriously, two days is too long for your ears to be ringing. You've done serious, irreparable damage.

In USSR's army's defense, Stalin made some VERY bad tactical decisions on the Finnish front. For example, because of Stalin's xenophobic paranoia, the troops largely originated from southern parts of Russia, and were thus completely unprepared for the harsh winter conditions.

      That looks goofy.  That's the way we see weather maps in the good ol' USA, too.  They cut off the people's republic of canadia, as if the northern border is the longest, straightest coast in the world.  I always think, they have the damn data already anyway, would it kill you to display how hot or cold it is in Toronto or Vancouver?

      You know, the first time I saw The Princess Bride I was in high school and had just been studying WWII. I heard that line and thought it did, in fact, refer to Germany's defeat in the USSR, because the USSR is technically in Asia? And Hitler was so foolish to think he could defeat the hardy Soviets in their own wickedly-cold country.  I realized my mistake upon a repeat viewing.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also never considered the fact that we LOST in Vietnam until it was spelled out by John Cleese in A Fish Called Wanda. I mean, they really did whip our butts! <br/>

      An actor in a comedy is not the best place to learn history, grasshopper.  If we lost in Vietnam, then why is it an open, capitalist country today instead of a communist shit hole?  Vietnam was a holding action, a proxy war between the USSR/Red China and the West, fought to a draw, saving the rest of southeast Asia and Indonesia from going commie.

      The Americans undoubtebly lost in Nam, saigon fell to northern forces, the huge exodus of boat people, the whole ho chi minh city thing. However following the collapse of communism in the USSR vietnam stopped receiving aid from Russia (which is why the vietnamese hate Russia far more than the Americans or the French, sure the Americans bombed them, but the Russians stopped coughing up, far worse when you're dealing with the 3rd world) as a result the economy had to be liberalised, basically its not America's victory, it's the communist bloc's blunder that means vietnam is essentially capitalistic. <br/>

      Well, that's one way of looking at it, pogo, another way of looking at it, as indicated by Comrade Tom, is that the people of the country wanted to be communists when they thought that was in their best interests, and capitalists when that was in their best interest. <br/>

By you way of thinking, it had nothing to do with the choices of the people in that country.  It was U.S.A. all the way.

      That is a very apt description. They're smiling, a lot, and the air around them looks very British. At least one of them is wearing an Achewood T, presumably to facilitate recognition. Just mentally squish their usersigils together and you can fill in the rest.

      True, but that doesn't mean it was "big", necessarily.  The voting turn-outs go up every year about, because the population continues to grow.  Thus, exponentially, the youth vote would also increase.  It still only made up 12 percent of the West Virginia block, and similar stats nationwide.  No doubt Obama IS increasing these numbers, but...I don't know, I'm a hard case.  They should be increased more. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just am easily spurred when some girl can tell me which band out of millions she prefers, and take hours and hours out of her day studying up on guitar-pickers, but couldn't possibly just come to a conclusion about three candidates. <br/>

      It makes my blood boil when I hear the experts discussing the all-important "working-class white vote" and dismissing the fact that Obama has overwhelming support among blacks and people with a college education, as if they were third-class citizens and will vote for whatever crap candidate we give them as long as he or she promises to think for a few seconds longer than McCain before launching another war. They couldn't be more wrong - I've had so many arguments with peers who've insisted on not voting because "they're all the same" and would actually vote for the first time if Obama were on the ballot. I don't think any of them would be stupid enough to vote for McCain in protest, but it's very likely that a lot of the youth would stay home if Hilary manages to fanagle a win.

Are there any good resources for locating Finnish fjords online?  Is there an email service I can sign up for that will notify me of new fjords every ten million years?  Is it possible for me to ride a shark through the fjords while someone behind me plays Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song?"   Is there ever a machine that is a chair that you sit in and a shotgun is placed in your mouth and the shotgun dribbles mints down your throat, but every time someone purchases a NUON, the shotgun blows your head off?

      Yeah, it kind of saddened me, too. I didn't particularly like his  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925100932/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=03172008">jibe at England</a> , either, and I'm not particularly patriotic. <br/>

I don't even know why I like Finland! I guess it's because I've heard a bit of Finnish electro-pop, which I liked.

      I'm a Brit, and "One for the Brits" is one of my favourite strips. Onstad's visited the UK, has a fairly solid understanding of its main quirks and seems overall to be a bit of an Anglophile. But does he know shit about Finland? I don't know, man, I don't know.

      On second thoughts, why the hell are we getting so uppity? It's not like he's hitting any Finnish nerves here; exposing discomforting truths about the nation's ever-growing trident problem. <br/>

As Dave said below, it works pretty well as a jibe at 'kipedia. Kinda like  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925100932/https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/12/16/">this Penny Arcade strip</a> . <br/>

      Lol, no way man.  I love He-Man.  Anything with He-Man gets an automatic 5 stars from me.  Especially if they take the characters and make them act like real people like when he calls He-Man a tremendous jackass.  But yeah I really liked He-Man when I was growing up so when someone else brings it up its like we're bonding over common ground.  As long as Penny Arcade is down with He-Man I am down with them. <br/>

      But no, seriously, things were a lot simpler before handface weekend, when one just assumed that we were all losers hiding behind cartoon faces. Now all of a sudden there's all these real girls talking about how they got some and part of you just wants to go "AARGH shut UP!" and go back to a time when jokes about being sexually frustrated would receive vaguely universal assent instead of being contradicted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry, don't mind me, carry on. I'm just a little bitter, in the same way that Dr. Robotnik was just slightly overweight.

      We mostly fought for the South in the Civil war.  Okie flats was settled by southerners.  The drawl is southern.  The women have the same hair as the stewardess a few days ago.  Southern social standards suffuse the state, and we inherited Southern Baptist religion.  We aren't Deep South, but Oklahoma is far more southern than anything else.  We even subjugated our own race into a near slavery state, just like the south.  Our's are more red though, but we got the race riots just the same

      Oh man, I ain't talking about being culturally Southern.  I knew people in college who were from towns only an hour out of Chicago that had drawls, style/automobile preferences and casual racial prejudices normally associated with the South.  I'm strictly talking geography here: as you would say, more the Deep South.  Hell people in Montana can be very Southern, but that doesn't mean we should call it part of the South. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suppose I'm thinking historically here, the original South, old South, Deep South, etc.  What was always called the South before Manifest Destiny, etc.  Basically, states with SEC teams in them (and North Carolina/Virginia).

      We're socially, geographically, and (once we got settled) historically, Southern.  There isn't much else that can really dictate being southern.  The fact that we weren't really populated by honkies when the other honkies were complaining about the north doesn't really detract from being southern.

      All good points, I suppose.  But that doesn't change the fact that nobody in the real South is ever gonna think of Oklahoma as the South.  I live in NC, and they don't even consider the  <em>town I live in</em>  to be Southern.  Oklahoma ain't got a chance in hell.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's country, for sure, but it ain't Southern.  If you touch Kansas, you're in the  <strong>Midwest</strong> .  I think that's a rule somewhere. <br/>

Incidentally, I feel much better prolonging this really stupid discussion (of which I'm the majority of the stupid) now that a new strip is up.

      Oh man, I have been waiting for just this kind of opportunity to make my first post.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
My dad's family is all Finnish, so he grew up speaking Finnish on the family farm in Michigan's upper peninsula and I've learned a number of fun phrases from him.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
My utter favorite is "haista napa," which translated directly means "smell my belly button." This has been my favorite swear since I was six years old, and even if Finland had contributed nothing else to the world I would be satisfied with just this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, the appropriate comeback is supposedly "paska housu," or "shitty pants." <br/> 
 <br/> 
And now I just learned that "Paskahousu" is also a popular card came in Finland. Thanks Wikipedia!

I like 'em both, and you gotta respect any guy who gets traded, shows up to the arena with like 5 mins before game time after rushing from Chicago, gets that done to his face in his first game and then still plays the next game.

When I was in highschool, I looked up the yarn "recipe" for the Tom Baker scarf, hoping that my mom would knit a replica for me.  It contained  <strong>truckloads</strong>  of yarn (some of them quite expensive). I never got that scarf.  Probably better off.  (even  <em>without</em>  it, I didn't do any bonin')

      Roast Beef is feeling pretty bad for Finland and Finns in panel 5. I imagine that's the face he wears when he sees a 9 year old with a harelip at the mall, all imagining him at his prom, kind of a stupid haircut, no date but trying to pretend that's cool, trying to sip casually at some punch but spilling it all over the rent-a-tux. Depression means never remembering that the Smile Train exists.

      Postage stamps in Finland are plain blue squares. The man who wanted to put a reindeer on them was eventually hounded out of the country, forced to live in Belgium and never saw a reindeer again. It's Finland's greatest shame, and also its greatest triumph.

      I originally wrote "(Philippe's/Ray's moms and Ultra Peanut don't count)," but then I figured it would be sufficiently obvious that they're not really sufficiently fleshed out to include in the roster of "characters." How many strips are they in all together? Like, 30? <br/>

      Well I do like the Molly/Roast Beef interactions, but remember there was a couple of years before she even came into the picture, and I had no problem with the lack of female characters then. In fact one could say that the addition of Molly was a big factor in what made Achewood more story arc-driven (or vice versa). I just have a lot of nostalgia for the absurd non-sequitur strips (though it's backwards nostalgia since I only started reading last year). And I think a large part of what enabled that was that it was just a bunch of screwed up guys with no women in their lives.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm trying to figure out whether the addition of main female characters (except for mothers and such) always has to bring some kind of romantic element into the picture and make it more "real" in a sense. For example, Beavis & Butthead wouldve been totally destroyed if they tried to do that, but they did have Daria - do you think she was three-dimensional or was she just kind of a straight man (woman)?

      As one who has lived past the screwed-up-male-roommates stage, I can tell you that the bonding of male friends continues and even deepens after marriages, divorces, and kids.  There's something about guys that demands they run in little packs and tussle for alpha status and stick together through thick and thin.  That viewpoint is what makes Achewood tick.

      <em>I had no problem with the lack of female characters then</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe  <em>you</em>  didn't, but for those of us whose gender is disproportionately underrepresented when it comes to protagonists or believable characters, it may have been more noticeable. I don't need female characters to be romantic. If Ray's and Philippe's moms were actual characters, I'd be totally down with that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
How often do "screwed up guys with no women in their lives" literally have ZERO women in their lives? No neighbors, no friends, no bosses, no unrequited crush? Even if you and all your friends are without girlfriends, the reality is that you still interact with and have relationships with women all the time, because women make up half the population. You can't avoid us! We are inextricably tied up in your lives! Portraying a world without women is at best inaccurate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've watched, like, three episodes of Daria. All I know about her is that she has a friend who dyed tiger stripes into her hair. <br/>

Anyway, I'm glad I'm making this comment two days late. I'll probably still get lamed for it, as I do whenever I start getting uppity about wimmin's issues.

      Can't say I can disagree with the Bechdal Standard. However, Achewood has a hard enough time retaining the characters that it already has. Even Pat is verging on irrelevance, I can't see Emeril and Spongebath being used in the near future and Lie Bot has been MIA for over a year. The strip is, essentially, about Ray and Beef hanging around and being dudes, dealing with their insecurities, and let's face it, it is far more dialogue than story oriented.

      It would be rather difficult to fit another female character into the mix without fundamentally changing Achewood as it currently stands, is all I am saying.

      Fair enough, but I  wasn't advocating for another female character. I was just saying I didn't want to see Molly go, which she probably would have if Beef had gotten with the peanut-slinger.

      I have no problems with Beef bolting on the peanut slinger, but I really wanted to see him be successful. I wanted to see him struggle with having money and being the opposite of in 'circumstances'. What is a rich Beef like? <br/> 
 I bet he would be awesome. Too bad we didn't get to see it.

      Which reminds me, we need more Lyle strips. Few things made me happier than seeing Lyle puke on a football right after all the "AWWW" comments on the strip where Beef pops the question.

And yes, reggae and rap are releated.  The dudes in Jamaica and other islands were doing their "dj" thing long before rap, and many people consider "dj-ing" the origin of rap.
