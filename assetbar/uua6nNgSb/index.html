      Given that the previous strip didn't particularly amuse me, it is just as well that my co-workers left the room while I was reading it... as when I got to this one I actually laughed quite loudly... and every time I say "Ottowa modified death" to myself I end up laughing again.  <br/> 
I guess the answer is obvious in hindsight: just add Beef.

      Hmm, I was always under the impression that latkes ALWAYS meant "potato pancakes," but just for laffs, I searched for "buckwheat latkes," and sho'nuff: <br/> 
 <br/> 
" <em>The predominant potato latke is an Ashkenazi, or Eastern European, tradition that began with the farming of potatoes in the mid-19th century.... Before that, Jews made latkes from buckwheat, and long before that, cheese.</em> "   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101003200124/https://m.reporternews.com/news/2007/Dec/06/with-hanukkah-come-latkes-other-food-traditions/">(source)</a> <br/>

      This strip is a perfect example of how Achewood has a strong sense of comic timing.  The timing comes from the fact that Chris has spent so long building the characters' repartee in his readers' heads.  I think this is why everyone who discovers achewood has to start from the beginning to really get the humor.

      I completely agree with you on this one. Only a few of the strips are "stand-alone" funny; you need to really know the characters idiosyncrasies to appreciate the strips as much as they deserve.

      Man, that is backwards though.  Until people got uppity about it, they used to have snapping dogs harrass cows before the slaughter because adrenaline makes things taste great.  So the more excited and perturbed an animal is upon its cessation of biological function the better it tastes.  It simulates the animal's chemical nature as if it had been hunted, see.  And we've been hunting the things longer than we've been domesticating. <br/>

All I'm saying is that modified death is probably for people who feel bad about eating natural protein but are too wishy washy/love bacon too much to be vegetarian.

      Y'know that's so weird, I read this comment yesterday, and today I was doing some completely unrelated college research (I was reading a book about roadsigns) and came across his thing about raising the adrenaline levels of animals in incredibly cruel ways before killing them. Apparently it's an aphrodisiac in South Korea. Makes a man's erection stay for hours. There was some horrible joke abut how this kind of meat is difficult to preserve and it won't last, but your boner will.

      Except for the fact that muscular tension leads to a lowered glycogen supply, and thus less lactic acid, than meat from animals killed while calm. And lactic acid is one of the main things that stops meat from spoiling, plus it makes meat look and taste good. <br/>

This is all from Harold McGee, by the way, who is  <em>fucking amazing</em>  if you've never read any of his work.

      I could read this over and over. Actually, I HAVE read it over and over. Of all the other hilarious elements to it, Beef saying "suddenly he is shanked" instead of "suddenly he's shanked" cracks me up. Why is this?

      When I lived in Ottawa, I used to drive out once a month or so to a free-range venison ranch where I'd buy steaks, ground and stew cubes.  I never saw any geek stags on the grounds though. <br/>

      There are many reasons why this could have occurred, such as: 1. you weren't looking for them; 2. you wouldn't recognize one if you saw one; 3. they are disposed of quite quickly; 4. they are kept hidden away so as not to alarm the customers.

      Oh man, I just thought of something.  This might be a journey, stay with me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is a brewing company known as Flying Dog, based in Colorado and in my home state of Maryland.  The name comes from a hallucination the founders had one night camping with various substances in tow, and they idolize the works of Hunter S. Thompson.  They brew stuff with names like "Double Dog," "Old Scratch," "Gonzo," "Horn Dog," etc, and they are exceedingly talented at their craft. <br/>

How the hell cool would it be if Onstad teamed up with these dudes to produce "Cats and Doggs," a beer celebrating the friendship of two cartoon cats who are no stranger to weirdness?  As a loyal Achewood reader, I formally request this, knowing exactly how long those odds are.
