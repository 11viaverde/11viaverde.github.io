      Whoa, Molly is just ponytails, basic moral reason and a backpack? Anyone who identifies with Raost Beef and is lucky enough to have a woman like Molly in their life to help them through basic situations will understand that her character is far more complex than that. Molly is every depressed man's perfect woman - she of boundless understanding and generosity.

      i disagree. Mostly we only see Molly when she is criticizing beef for something. In spite of  being a dead person she is very boring and normal. The idea of "man is messy and weird" and "woman is a civilizing influence" is easily the most conservative element of achewood yo. <br/>

      Yikes.  Are those my only choices? <br/>

I love and identify with Beef, AND I think Molly needs development to be on par with the other characters.  As it is, pigtails, moral common sense, backpack, check, check, check.  That she comforts and complements Beef does not make her a well-rounded character, fellas.

      I don't think you could be more wrong, there is absolutely nothing boring about Molly, she is an extremely deep character if you have the personal experience to relate to R.B.'s life style and the feeling of finding a person who perfectly completes you.

      Exactly her point: "Every depressed man's perfect woman".  She's a great character, with depth, but her existence is defined in relation to a man.  I dont really have a problem with this aspect of the strip, but I think pleasantpondfarm is right on.  It doesn't so much seem forwardly misogynistic as just a world devoid of women.  A couple more female characters might be a good way to go though.  <br/> 
PS- Ultra Peanut always gets forgot.

      I think that Molly is probably a complex character, but we only really know that because she's going out with Beef. She doesn't have the same kind of distinctive voice that the other characters do. I reckon that's because in the strip we only really see her interacting with Beef. We never get a strip that consists of just her and Lyle, say, or her and Ray, and I think it's strips like that that really defined the other characters. In her blog, she gets on well with Teador and Cornelius - a strip or two exploring those relationships would be fantastic.

      I was about to try to refute this, but you're entirely correct so I can't. I don't think most thoughtful dudes feel comfortable admitting it, but at the base of our souls - once we bust through the carefully constructed "good, well-adjusted dude" personas we construct for ourselves - this is absolutely what we want out of a woman. Maybe I need to find an Asian (but not you, D - I think you're much too self-actualized to selflessly nurture me properly).

      how's it going, rowbox? i am glad you agree that i am right. probably the only thing wrong with my description is the "not having a lot going on besides you" part, which can be problematic if she's needy and hangs around too much and stuff. i don't know what molly does in her spare time.. probably housewifing. you don't really want a housewife do you?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
and yep, the secret is out. i am nothing if not a terrible girlfriend. daedala WILL call you at 4 in the morning to tell you to check your email because she sent you a picture of pigs. daedala WILL lock herself in the bathroom until you admit that you prefer masturbating to relations with her, then she will open the door and yell "fine, i hate your stupid peener ANYWAY!". daedala WILL break up with you because being in a stable relationship is like being married and hella boring yo.  <br/>

      Yeah, I don't make a real good housewife, actually. I work full time, I'm not so hot around the kitchen and I definitely require.... <em>repayment</em>  for foot massages.

      My sense is that given how carefully CO builds his characterizations, he might feel uncomfortable drafting another female character or three.  It is true that Molly is a little on the light side, character wise, and most of her character is exposed through comparison and interaction with Beef.  Maybe it is more or less just self-confidence/insecurity (Achewood's biggest theme, after all).

      So...  The only reason a character would exist, and happen to be female, is to be a love interest?  Actually, in Achewood, that's true.  The person selling Polish sausages outside of the GOF: male.  The two scarred trash pickers at the trash dump: male.  Every act represented by Ray: Male, male, male and boy band.  The dead souls we see in heaven: Male.  The last throwaway character I can remember that was female was the woman with the 'lousy breasts' in the arc where Philippe goes looking for the couch, and that was so that Onstad could make a 'lousy breasts' joke.  Everything in Achewood is male.  If a character is introduced and female it is either a mother figure, a love interest, or an ass/set of boobs to be stared at. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Do you realize how unnatural that is?  I am not saying that tomorrow the strip would be better if he introduced twelve characters, all strong females with independent lives, I am saying that he has built a false world, one utterly deprived of female contact.  Girls exist, and I'm really sorry if that cause boys anxiety, but the happy little land of the cats talking about getting their bone on begins to look rather odd as a single gender society. <br/> 
 <br/> 
No, Molly is not a well-rounded character.  Molly is a foil for Beef, and is written off unless Beef needs to be yelled at/coddled/sassed.  She takes care of Beef, she works a chain of menial, service sector jobs where men scream at her/stare at her boobs, and comes home to a guy who can't bite through his own toast.  I love Molly, and I love Roast Beef, but she is a one dimensional mirror to provide the balance to the self-obsessed, uncaring, abusive shrew of a mother. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the whore/saint stereotypes are just lazy writing.

      There could be more girl characters without it being like a soap-opera and having them hook up with everyone.  Onstad is good- he could write them however he wanted. There could just be ladies doing dumb shit and getting drunk and bullshitting around and maybe even having a day where they get addicted to online porn (this has been a day in the history of my friends).  The possibilities are endless.

      I think you are misunderstanding Achewood's purpose.  The reason I see for Achewood's lack of female characters (and also for Molly being defined in part by her relationship with Beef) is because Achewood is about the guys. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By that, I do not mean it is intended for a male audience, merely that it is about the social interactions of a circle of friends, or brochachos, if you will, just generally having a rad time.

      Hm, I see. This is like women's television.  You feel you are not "being represented". <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the official record, Achewood ain't broke.  (At least not yet, I'm reading from the beginning first time through)  This comic isn't really about love stories.  Molly is a (complex, extremely well written) co-depressive, and she's here because Beef needs her in order to be functional and happy (sometimes, rarely).  Otherwise, these are stories about the baddest dudes in town.  <br/> 
I would SO read a spin-off or a side project, written and illustrated by Onstad of course, that was heavier on the females but I'm pretty sure it would just muddy the achewater here.

      what are you talking about?! this storyline not only makes up for the lack of female characters, it makes up for my life and the lack of anything positive happening in it. come on, how can you not agree that most women are clear horrible toys? i'm sure the male readers of achewood would not find the opposite of this strip offensive or man-hating.  <br/>

(Alex Borstein playing Lyle): "I think that men are opaque, like a yellow pus squeezed from a cancerous prostate filled with hair and unexpressed emotions." <br/>

      True story. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One of my first real jobs was working as part of a right-of-way clearing crew for things such as power lines and pipelines. My dad worked for the same company, so it seemed like a decent place to start my career. It was run by a psychopathic french canadian, but that is also beside the point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My dad, myself, and my brother who was on summer vacation were at a job site in Maine, which is about a thousand states to the north of where we came from. To save money, we had this little, pathetic pop-up trailer that we were wedged into. No amenities whatsoever - showers were in a concrete bunker through the pine trees about half a mile. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then we decided that since we were in Maine, it was time to eat some Lobster. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We went down to the grocery store, and picked up a few lobsters, but we couldn't figure out a way to cook the things. Pop up trailers aren't exactly big on stoves. So we decide to get these broil-in-a-bags and throw them on the grill. <br/> 
 <br/> 
First part of the operation was a success. We take the lobster, throw him in the bag with some water, roll it up tight, and toss it on the top of the hot grill. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Five minutes or so later, we're all getting nicely drunk, and we hear it. The worst sound ever. A sound that still haunts me to this day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The sound of a poor, pathetic claw scraping against foil. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We turn, as one man, to survey the grill, and there, SURE ENOUGH, there's that horrible sound, the forlorn hope of a doomed creature, being tortured beyond it's weak imaginings. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then it got worse. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>The bag started moving.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I could see the claw trying weakly to poke through the bag. I could see the little legs, sadly flopping around inside the superheated bag, antennae no longer even moving from the heat.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The bile started to rise in my throat. I wanted to sob, to scream, to rescue that poor creature or, being beyond my means, smash it's head with a rock and end it's suffering for good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Luckily, before I enacted upon such unmanly displays, my brother laconically found a solution to our problems. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He put the lid on the grill. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was the most delicious Lobster ever!

      And here's a flimsily connected true story of my own: <br/> 
 <br/> 
About fifteen years ago I was walking through a desolate field near the Kansas/Missouri border. I still lived at home and it was as good a place as any to secretly get high on drugs. So I was quite high on drugs and young, besides. In this field at this time, everything was very nice and imbued with that certain light fuzziness that comes with being young and stoned in a place where nothing is and little ever has been. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was in this state that I came across a shoebox. It was a shoebox which had been literally  <em>stuffed</em>  full of dead kittens. Really, it must have been an effort fitting them all in that one small box. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I was young and high (back when being high still meant something) and I was occupying the same forgotten field as this terrible little box. The kittens were still pink and soft and asleep-looking and somehow that was worlds worse than a box of decomposed kittens. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wasn't a big fan of this experience. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The End
