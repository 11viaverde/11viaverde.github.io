      This is basically what puppies are for. There is no more efficient way to make someone happy; even an ugly dog will please a dour woman or man, not giving a damn whether or not the fellow wishes to be pleased. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They run around and have just the happiest old time. That is their agenda and they'll do it whatever you have to say. You learn to roll with it, and everything they do is adorable. Between that and their surprising ability to like you no matter how shitty you are, it is pretty hard to be too sad around a dog. <br/>

Incidentally, the font on Beef's shirt is older than the micro or minicomputer. It is called Westminster and is almost as old as my parents. Hell of a thing.

      The difference between cat persons and dog persons is that cat persons like to spend money on something that hates them.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dog persons are just more likely to have kids to fill this role.

      Don't read too much into my comment above.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, that being said, if you're into gentleness and considerateness, why would you be into cats?  All the cats I've known seem to care only about themselves and thoroughly enjoy clawing things (e.g. my thighs).

      Yeah, one thing about dogs is that they emote. They have a big flag on their ass that lets you know how they feel, 24/7. Also, they've been bred through the generations to seek out human company and look to humans for support and help, and to supply the same in the reverse.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cats are... wild. They say that a dog is only a few generations away from a wolf, but I've never lost the feeling that when a cat looks at me with those alien gemstone eyes, it's thinking of itself, ten times larger, chasing me through dry scrub and smelling blood.

      Man, that is exactly the opposite of my experience with cats.  Most of the cats I've known have been affectionate, loving creatures.  My elderly kitty Natasha is sleeping on my shoulder right now.  Most of the dogs I've known are frankly too stinky and ungainly to cuddle with.

      I'm definitely a cat person, but it has nothing to do with gentleness nor considerateness. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean I don't hate dogs. They've got the stupidity of the average person without that oblivious maliciousness that humans have in spades. I want them to go away, but I don't want to flay them alive in the process like I want to do to people.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cats however, are completely honest, non-annoying, non-malicious, and generally fine in every way. They do their own sort of thing, let you know softly when they want attention, go away when they don't, reward you for doing what they want, punish you for doing what they don't want, and totally don't judge me for wanting to flay people alive because they totally maul things for fun too.

      Cats are good for a depressed person because they do not rely on you so you can't let them down. A cat doesn't jump on you when you come home or (usually) try to wake you up; they simply exist in your house, and they will not complain too much if you want them to sit and watch TV with you. I have four cats, which sounds like a lot until you realize that three of them spend most of their time sleeping in hidden places and the fourth sleeps  <em>on</em>  you, but even the one that hates me will come around and sit with me and purr when I'm upset. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cats are rad if you have enough of them to represent the common temperaments: angry and evil, invisible, occasionally invisible, and "Oh man you're just like a dog except if you bug me I can throw you across the room." <br/>
