In the idiom of Southern Baptists, this ritual is referred to as "sharing and fellowshipping." There's my bit of trivia for you guys today.

      It is my secret and private theory, (which I will only let out here, where I suspect very few will see it,) that the intelligent animals in Achewood are the result of Achewater consumption, similar to Terrence Mckenna's "stoned ape" theory of evolution. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the early days, (the 1930s) the intelligent animals were a lot more buck-wild. Luckily for dogs, they have since settled down.

      I really like the idea of an entire group of grown men tipping over a pedal-car. I mean, really how much effort would that take? A pedal-car can't be much heavier than, say, a tricycle, yes? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, was the child riding the car at the time of the incident? Probably not, but it's nice to think so.

      You know, my favorite part of this strip is probably the fact that Mr. Phepps was boozing with his cat. I know there's not a lot of cat/human relations in Achewood, but the idea of a man and his can drowning their sorrows together truly warms my heart.
