      What disturbs me about Yojimbo is the amount of detail in his head/face.  Regular characters are line-drawings with subtle details to suggest features and expressions.  Folks with detail are George Michael climbing over the fence or the Devil or Johnny Cash complaining that he's not dead.  I guess that's what I didn't like about Molly's father, too:  so many lines to capture his wrinkles and folds.

      Shit, and  <em>edwell</em> . I miss those motherfuckers. This place shore ain't hardly the same since they did away with hastily photoshopped buggery. I feel like a has-been musician who's suddenly stopped getting royalties on his old hit singles as they passed into the public domain or something.

      he is certainly not the one that got the image posts disabled - you can't blame him for this one at all.  the blame lies with assetbar management for not fixing very simple vulnerabilities in assetbar. <br/>

      not only that, I'm not even the one who wrote "rb is here" in all the profiles.  THAT is why imgs got disabled, and I didn't do it.  But I know who did, and he has posted on this page...  <br/>

 Also, to the best of my knowledge, the exploit that was used to write "rb was here" has not been fixed yet.  disabling images just makes it harder to trigger the exploit, but by no means impossible...

      This is not how copyright law works. At least in the United States. Intellectual Property remains the exclusive right of its creator until 70 years after the creator's death, or 95 years from creation/120 years from publication (whichever is sooner) for works copyrighted by corporations (eg. Mickey Mouse). However this will change soon, seeing as how the US government will not let Mickey Mouse enter the public domain. Copyright term was life 50 until Mickey was going to do exactly that in the late 70s, leading to the Sonny Bono Act. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also that is not how music royalties work. Royalties are paid by record companies (not end-users) to performers (not songwriters). How do you think people like Britney Spears who don't write their own songs make so much money? Royalties for the underlying copyright are a different matter altogether, and are often not referred to by that name in front of lay-people.  <br/> 
 <br/>

      as a modern parent, i have all the mickey shorts and all the looney tunes shorts in AVI.  over the years, i'm sure you've all come to trust me as a great critic of art, so i offer my judgment for your perusal.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
* looney tunes is the rudest, crudest, "lets be complete assholes to each other for absolutely no reason at all" kind of cartoons you'll ever see. <br/> 
* disney mickey/pluto/donald etc shorts are generally pussy shit in comparison.  problems are caused by people's ineptitude, or nature's lack of cooperation.  When there is people vs. people conflict, there is usually some justification of it. <br/> 
* they're both infinitely better than Lilo & Stich or Spongebob Squarepants or Clifford the Big Red Dog because they don't have the whole "bad people are people too and just need more love" or "it's ok for men to be feminine" or "let's make sure to put a lot of handicapped characters in the show, not bring up that they're handicapped, just show them doing awesome things so kids learn handicapped people are just normal people" type messages.  Your kids may learn how to be better assholes by watching looney tunes, but they were assholes to begin with.

      Yes exactly another way to put it is it's like when you rape a girl and then force her to pose with you for a picture which you toss in an album and soon forget about -- that would be normal and healthy -- versus if you cut off her face and take it home and wear it to bed every night for over a year -- that would indicate some kind of unhealthy fixation possibly as a result of an addictive personality which you might need to work through with the help of counseling and AA.

      It's like trying to rape a girl but having a penis so small that it doesn't legally qualify as rape and neither the supposed victim nor the police can be moved to care but still you run around town bragging to everyone that you're a rapist even though your penis is too small to legally be considered an instrument of rape.

      Until I read your post I had not considered that the cadet would be a woman. It is strange that my ideas of what gender a soldier should be are less flexible than my ideas about whether men can lactate. It must have something to do with my childhood, and the abuse I endured at the hands of my misogynistic, lactating, Drill-Sergeant uncle.

      in high school i was really excited to go on a trip to greece with 50 kids my age, but then i caught mono. I had the most severe case my doctor had ever seen. So i stayed home and watched the first 5 seasons of entourage, consumed only apple juice, and generally hated life.  <br/> 
 <br/>

okay what you do - and this is going to sound kind of gross - but you somehow or other get hold of a used condom...  and you cut a hole in the tip... and you use it...  if that grosses you out, you can wear a regular condom under the used condom... then a few years later when she comes after you for child support, you can be like "fuck you you cheating lying whore bitch" as you shove the DNA test papers in her face and the judge will be like "yep, pretty much."

      The worst part of watching hot dogs being made wasn't the meat that went into it. That was fine. I mean, chorizo is made from salivary glands and lymph nodes and announces it proudly on the back of the tube. The worst part was watching the meat get ground into a very fine paste before the addition of corn syrup and some sort of artificial smoking process. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hickory-smoked horse buttholes would be fine if they were actually smoked. <br/>

      I make my own sausages. Normally on Sunday mornings, while my girlfriend is at church, because she hates to see me doing it. This isn't some sort of euphemism by the way. The best one I ever made was hare legs and pork shoulder, with sumac, black pepper and juniper. Lamb neck, anchovy and caper tasted great, but the texture was a bit off. Beef shin and horseradish was a fucking disaster. Basically, there is a good reason why sausages are traditionally made with pork, except among people whose religions ban it, and while you can play silly buggers with the flavorings, you omit the pig at your peril.

 <br/> 
i only ask 'cuz it seems like guys who make their own sausage are usually knee deep in pussy. curiously, you may not be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
pork is crazy shit for sure. i mean, just the entire pig, from inception - like its whole life, how it lives and what it does - to what it becomes, mostly ham and bacon. i mean, you can pretty much cure any bland-ish, mundane run of-the-mill entre or appetizer by somehow incorporating bacon (implied: or bacon grease). <br/> 
 <br/> 
pork as a main dish is gross tho. i did a pork loin philipino style (broiled, boiled in vinegar, pan fried). next day after cooling, it looked like it'd been hit with pastry glazing machine. just thick white congealed fat. fucking gross. <br/>

      I had some trouble understanding your post due to what I assume was a technical error, but I'll respond to your questions as best I can. <br/> 
1 - No, not poison sumac. The type of sumac which is used as spice in middle eastern cooking. In future I will be sure to specify, in case any recipe tips I proffer go horribly wrong. <br/> 
2 - I suspect you are being light-hearted when you aver that guys who make their own sausages are usually 'knee deep in pussy'. Fair enough, but I feel I must point out that on the scale of peculiar things I do, sausage making rates rather lower than posting on a forum about a cat comic (and miles below my habit of sculpting life size models of Dwight Schultz out of soap).

 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Ive overheard people talking about Coddle in my office, so I went to the once place that I knew would have it. <br/>
<br/>
Coddle is a form of stew, made in Ireland, with sausages, bacon, onions, potatoes, pepper, and water. You take a saucepan two-thirds full of cold water and add as many sausages as you like, as many slices of back bacon as you like, as many onions as your appetite can handle, and as many peeled floury potatoes as your heart desires. Then you put it on the heat. When it boils, turn down the heat and simmer it for half an hour to ensure that all the pork products cook through. <br/>
<br/>
The culinary-minded will have noticed that at no point do any of the meat products go through the normal processes of browning, searing, crisping, etc., that transform sausage and bacon from mere oversalted lumps of pig into splendid delicacies. No, they are simmered in plain cold water with only potato, onion, pepper, and their own salt for flavoring. No wonder, then, that the sausages come out looking like boiled human penises, while the bacon is flaccid and greasy. Coddle is a really shit meal, the food equivalent of a wet Wednesday afternoon in Bray, which is a small and not very exciting seaside town about 15 miles south of Dublin that's chiefly notable for having a mildly pleasant view of the Irish Sea. It is proof that even traditional cookery with top-grade organic ingredients is perfectly capable of producing something that tastes absolutely fucking disgusting</em></div> <br/>

      itsd ben hyears since i rescaped form my psyche ward. my hands were temblin nah more den ebre. i could feel teh atoms of teh sidewalks under foot. eerry pebble, erry crack n teh road woz lik tremors sent up ma legs <br/> 
 <br/> 
the pain. i had to stop <br/> 
 <br/> 
i looked around a bit at teh empty streets, teh light o the moon elumin8n my vision as i panned arond, closed shops on either side wit teh foul stench of garbage, sex, and  <em>death</em> . the latter bothered me more than teh others, brignin back memries of ma past. memries of my time spent in psyche ward. <br/> 
 <br/> 
the smell seemed to be coming form dat alley over there <br/> 
 <br/> 
i start movin toward it, legs warblin form fatigue, smell getting ever more pungent as i near teh entrence. i try to peer in to see but is too dark atm. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i move closer <br/> 
 <br/> 
i can mak ott shapes of boxes, trash cans, assorted debris of dis sort. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>and a figure</em> --a moving figure! <br/> 
 <br/> 
my heart begins to race as i see its panic'd writhments upon seeing me. i hurry for my flashlight, my hand fumbles for teh switch--i turn it on--there he is, a black man, half naked, beard covered with feces, red, wild eyes fixed on me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
there is much anger in him; he begins moving towards me slowly (step: step) i move backwards at teh same base (sop: sop) he starts moving fasterer (step, step) and faster (step step) and faster (step--step) <br/> 
-- <em>and faster</em>  (step--step--step) i turn to try and run, but im too slow, i can hear him right behind me  <strong>(step--step--step--jump)</strong> --he tackles me, i feel his angry black weight on my back, i struggle to get away but he holds me down and starts undoing my clothes, pulling at my shirt and pants until they're removed. i scream for help <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Help! help me!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
the black man continues, i hear a flurry of zippers and clothes noise until i feel something prodding at my ass cheeks.  <em>it is the tip of his penis</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
" <strong>Help! sommmmmmebody hellllp me! heell*mrrrrrff*</strong> " he covers my mouth with his leather gloved hand and pierces my butt crack.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Ahhhrmrrrrfffff, rrrrf!"  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"shut up or ill kill you." <br/> 
 <br/> 
he starts pumping me with his member, up and down he goes, i contiue to struggle and writhe, but im no match for his ebonic strength. he holds me with his gloves and spreads my legs with his and has my ass all his own way <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Ahhrrffffggh, aghhhh, mrrrrf,  <strong>MMMRMRRRRRRFFFF</strong> " <br/> 
 <br/> 
i can feel his breathe on my neck as he violates me, i begin to cry, his putrid stench wafting with each movement of his body, the smell of unwashed leather under my nose and the intense pain of this mans penis penetrating my virgin ass. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"rrrrf. rrrrfrrr HElllrtrrfffhfghh" <br/> 
 <br/> 
my continue'd screams are all i can do, he pumps his last bit and finishs into my ass. in his ecstasy he lets go of my mouth for a moment and i try to call for help, ass bleeding from the punishment <br/> 
 <br/> 
" <em>helllllp meeee! somebody!</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
he cracks me on my head with the back of a knife, i am dazed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"i tol' you to shut up or i'd kill you." <br/> 
 <br/> 
he kneels down and puts the knife on my throat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>he slices</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
"--RRrrrrllll, urgle,gurgle, spahhhhhlll spurt" <br/> 
 <br/> 
i instinctively put my hands on my throat to try and stop the bleeding, but its no use. a few painful seconds pass before i fall over, unconcious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
then die.

      Did they put you in the max security ward with the killers cause you tossed cops around like beanbags? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I met this one Indian guy who'd been transferred there for observation because he ate forks and spoons in prison(to get out of prison for a while). He was a lifer.  <br/> 
He told me about when he was a little boy up in Nebraska he wandered onto the highway on the Res and got hit by a truck. He didn't speak English yet. <br/> 
They thought he was dead, but when he came to, he spoke this old dialect of Oglallah that the tribal elders barely could recognize. He didn't remember being that kid. <br/> 
It hadn't been spoken in 500 years. He was a shaman.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
He was a 5-year old healer, advising the old men of the tribe. He gradually came back to himself over a few months, forgot the old language.  <br/> 
Then he grew up and became a regular fuckup who killed a guy in a bar fight. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He said he'd never talked about it since until he met me.  <br/> 
Another guy there had been committed by his wife for sexual perversion. He'd gone down on her. One time. His name was Ira. I'm pretty sure he never was released. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Man, Grandpa sure is chatty today, ain't I? :)
