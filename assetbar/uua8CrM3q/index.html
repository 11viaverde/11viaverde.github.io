      I don't think you can know the objective truth.  There are only a finite number of observers reconstructing something infinitely complex, and none of them are perfect, but at the same time  <em>they don't know that they are wrong</em>  and  <em>you don't know they are wrong</em> . <br/>

      But sometimes they know they are wrong.  European chroniclers of Columbus' journey chose to portray the natives as soulless heathens.  This was objectively wrong (both factually and morally).  The subjective schema of the Europeans perverted everything to fit its divine grant of dominion over all of the non-Christian world. <br/>

      Chubbied for attempting proper philosophical debate, but I'm afraid I can't see the objective basis for your claims. It's impossible to know whether the natives are soulless heathens or not, that's the joy of scepticism and epistemology. We can at best intra-subjectively agree that they weren't, but that's still not an objective distinction...

      Probably one of those little horses you see on local news segments. Be Hard for Ray to crawl up on an actual sized horse, I figure. As long as you get the basic kind of picture, I think the size of the horse isn't the most important thing here.

Funny about the Hendrix reference; earlier I was looking at the Who's tour schedule in the 60s and kicking myself in the back of the head.  "What the fuck was I doing the nights of June 15 and 16, 1970 when the Who were playing Berkeley Community Theater?"  "NOTHING, FUCKING NOTHING!  AGHHHHH!"  Christ, I was like 15 years old and with a good start early in the morning could have literally walked to the fucking theater.  Life was so granite bound before you could look around on the internet and see what's happening.  You kids have no fucking idea how lucky you are not to be living the fucking dark ages! Fuck!

      Just the regrets of missing so many thing by *that* much.  I was so damn close, but almost never got there.  Hell, I wanted to go see the Beatles in the summer of '67, I knew about that, but couldn't raise the $5.  Try to imagine.  Now it's all gone.

      It's most def a different culture now; there are very few blockbuster bands that are big AND good, and even those that I can think of are certainly not at the level of bands like the Who and the Beatles. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, there are so many smaller bands that make fantastic music and tour all the time. The internet has also given us the ability to enjoy things that haven't blown the entire world away, but are still amazing. The fact that I own about 5000 songs and still don't have nearly every song I enjoy is something really crazy to me. So is the fact that I could probably go see a band I enjoy every month, even in my small city in Canada. Maybe not to the extent you describe, but still! <br/> 
 <br/> 
On a side note, living in the internet age is a blessing and a curse. It gives us access to all kinds of experience but also dilutes our life in a way, because there are so many things vying for attention that it makes it hard to focus on any one thing that you enjoy.

      Roughly $30 today. Can you imagine paying anything even remotely near that level for what is arguably the most popular band in the world at the time? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Tickets would be at least $80 face value these days and that's before Ticketmaster gets through raping you or you have to end up going to scalpers because all the tickets sold out in the first second since 60% of them were already given away to radio stations, corporate gifts, and the like. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember when the Smashing Pumpkins played their residency here a few years ago. You had to show up, get your ticket from will-call, and then they escorted you in and there was still plenty of scalping. A ton of it from people who bought their maximum allowable two tickets per night and were trying to meet up with other people who already had tickets so they could go on multiple nights. I mean, they tried, but for something like that I'd say no advance tickets is the only way to go. Let the seriously hardcore get it because they're willing to put in the work. It would suck, but at least I'd know that I missed my shot in exchange for a guy who was prepared to live in the line for a week.

      I'm slightly confused by this. Perhaps mostly because I have not seen my parents for Thanksgiving (or, for that matter, at all) in at least three years and I have no plans on doing so at any future time. I think it's closing in on six years since I last saw my father. I mean, I talk to him on the phone two or three times a year. <br/>

      I  <em>hate</em>  Ticketmaster. I am about to buy tickets from them and their convenience charges are upwards of ten dollars now! This is for twenty dollar tickets! <br/> 
I don't understand how they managed to get such a drastic monopoly. Last year I searched around for other alternatives and couldn't find anything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will be phoning the venue beforehand, though, and hopefully they can sell tickets to their own damn event.

      Haha! I bought tickets directly from the box office in the past and was charged a fee because I used a credit card for a pair of tickets. When the show was canceled they refused to refund the fee. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I read in the information for last year's Outside Lands Festival that if you didn't want to buy them online and pay a fee tickets were being sold from a local box office, were cash only, and there was a convenience fee to buy them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Other times you'll have shows, like Smashing Pumpkins a few years back, where sales were only online and there was a fee. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Most venues don't sell tickets to their own events, do so very grudgingly if they do, and tend to still charge you a fee to buy them from the box office or just a de facto fee where you pay less for advance tickets than day-of-show. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've been lucky though. Some local venues (the ones that aren't owned by LiveNation and their vertical monopoly) sell tickets online and only charge a fairly modest $2 fee to buy online. I hate being charged it, but considering taking the bus there would be $1.50 it at least works out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I recall from the last time I bought tickets from TicketMaster that they charge you more or less exactly the upward limit of what they're allowed to before they would start running afoul of anti-scalping laws. They tend tack on a bunch of other fees (my favorite is the payment processing fee!) on top of that which I think they get away with because they're not for the ticket itself, but the ability to buy it. The extra dollar to print the damn thing at home also really gets to me. Why in the hell would I pay that when I can get it from will-call or mailed for free? Shouldn't they encourage you to do it yourself?

      I don't miss that.  Even then the "popular" radio stations played crap about 70% of the time.  The only thing,  THE ONLY THING that saved my poor dorky suburban ass from complete crapotomy was that I stole my dad's FM tuner to see what it could do on the second floor of the house and found this station: KMPX!  They played real music.  They are long gone.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will never forget the time the announcer said, "We have the first album here by a band called Hot Tuna. Of course as you all know [I didn't!] that is Jorma Kaukonnen and Jack Cassidy from the Jefferson Airplane in their side project."  He played the whole thing from beginning to end.  I still go see those guys every chance I get.  Thank you KMPX!

      You're right it was '66.  They played at the ballpark in St. Louis where I lived  then.  I knew they were going to play, desperately wanted to go, but as far as I could figure it had no way to raise the $5 or get to the show.  I was a retarded 11 year old dork.  Course in 1966 who figured that the Beatles would already be done?  At the time I consoled myself with the thought that no way would I miss them next go round.  *[strange sort of ironic rue type] sigh*

      You know, for as awesome as it is to see the film of that show, think about how shitty it would've been to have actually be there at the time.

      Wait, what?  You know that they have footage of it, right?  It's the second half of the Let It Be documentary. <br/> 
There was a crowd of people sitting right in front of them, although I can't say how many of them were their posse and studio engineers and such.  I do think some of them were people off the street.  Also, there were a lot of people climbing to the nearby roofs.  Try [ul=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6G7MkBMVxE]Youtube[/url].

      I've seen it, man. I got the impression that most of the people on the same roof with them were entourage sorts. And I know some people were lucky enough to get to rooftops and that kind of thing, but this is the last Beatles show, yes? It just seems like Hyde Park or somewhere like that would've been more appropriate. I know they were eccentric geniuses and all that, but that shows that they had very little respect for their fans. It's insulting, now that I think about it. The physical arrangement of it speaks volumes about how they saw themselves in relation to the rabble.

      The Wikipedia article is interesting <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>A number of possible locations for the proposed live show were discussed during the rehearsals, with the leading candidates being the Roundhouse in London, a Roman amphitheatre in North Africa (where the Beatles would allow the audience to slowly fill the amphitheatre during the day before eventually performing either at dusk or dawn) or a cruise ship. McCartney also proposed a unusual concert tour in which the Beatles would turn up unannounced at university halls and small clubs around England to perform, an idea that Lennon apparently regarded as preposterous but was later carried out by McCartney with his post-Beatles band Wings. At one point, John Lennon jokingly suggested that he was "warming to the idea of doing it (the concert) in an asylum".[2]</em></div> <br/> 
I think the asylum would have been awesome . . . <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>The live concert idea culminated with the Beatles and Preston performing 30 January on the rooftop of the Beatles' Apple Building at 3 Savile Row before a small audience of friends and employees.</em></div> <br/> 
I guess that was their intent.  I don't know why they decided to play on the roof.  I suppose that they just wanted to get it over with.  They didn't want to go to Hyde Park or whatever, dang it, let's just do it on the roof! <br/> 
I am not a city boy, and I have no clue how audible the music would be, how distracting the sounds of the street would be.  I do think that most people heard it, at least a little.  They were looking up, the police were called.  Yeah, a lot of people heard the song, even thought they couldn't see the band or even really know who was playing.  I wouldn't call it insulting, though, it it was just for friends.

      While it certainly has issues and I agree that it would be more or less impossible to see I think the general idea of it was that they were doing a last concert and the damn thing was free and in public. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I, however, agree that a free show in Hyde Park would have made a lot more sense. Maybe do it as an unannounced sort of thing. Just go to the park, set up, and start playing like anyone else out busking. Fuck, how terrible would that be in compared to now? The Beatles played their last show for free in the park and you were just sitting at home or stuck at work or out running errands or something.

      Would have been me, except that I was in suspended animation all those years.  Undiagnosed severe Sleep Apnea.  I was a zombie for 30 plus years and had no clue what the problem was.  I only got a grip 3 years ago about the time I finally stopped self-medicating long enough to graduate from college.  So I am in the same boat as a lot of younger folks right now: all set to go, but nothing is happening much, and a lot of what is happening ain't so swell.  I'm not complaining mind you.  Damn glad to finally be awake!  And, hell, I live in Califreakinfornia, what me worry?  Still, if not for the Apnea, I know that I would be in a very different situation.  Just saying.  I mean, I was living in the suburbs of Northern California when Jimi played in San Francisco, I am sure at least once.  Clueless fuck that I was, I didn't even try to go.  Some kids my age had bailed on Suberbia and were hanging out with the Dead and the Airplane.  They didn't miss Hendrix or Cream!  WTF was I thinking about?!  Such is history.

      Modest Mouse played here in Phoenix about a month ago, and I went in spite of being high as shit.  Not on nail polish, mind you, but still... at the door they asked me to rip the barcode out of my printer paper concert ticket so they could scan it, but I heard "lick the barcode", and I complied.  I recieved the dumbest look of my life and was told to "get my shit together" by the doorman.  Good times.

      Well, we agreed about a movie on the last board, tekky, and now we'll disagree about this one. When it was over a felt like I'd been slapped. Really?  <em>Nothing</em>  is going to happen in this entire movie? I don't mean Murray and Johansson getting it on, or anything like that. Just  <em>anything</em>  memorable. Nope. It's over. Go away. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've given that woman several chances and she has done nothing but disappoint. Elsewhere,  <em>The Virgin Suicides</em>  was decent, but it should've been great. It was an eminently filmable story and under more able guidance I believe it could've been a classic - which it clearly is not in its present form. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, face it - if her name was Sofia Smith she'd be just another film school dropout working at the mall.

      He's made about five good to excellent films and a lot of fairly forgettable and mediocre ones. It's not the best ratio out there. That, of course, would be Kubrick who kept his number of films small enough that he never really made a truly bad film.  <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>  wasn't quite up to the caliber of his previous work, but I'll be damned if I'm going to say it sucked.

      You can say whatever you want about the movie itself. But I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here and let you say that Bill Murray's performance in it was anything less than stellar. Yes, it was quiet, it was tired, it was lackadaisical. It was SUPPOSED to be. He was playing a man who, for all intents and purposes, has forgotten how to take any joy in life, who can go to fucking JAPAN and not enjoy it whatsoever, and to top it all off, he has insomnia. If you ask me, Murray conveyed all of these things, and more, perfectly.

Your criminal negligence of Big Star is criminally negligent. They were a pop band in the early 70s that was still playing pop music. They influenced basically everyone in power pop and are felt rather deeply today. R.E.M., The Replacements, Cheap Trick, the dB's, Teenage Fanclub all have cited substantial influence. The theme song for "That 70s Show" was a cover of their song "In The Street".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pavement are probably one of the most important independent/alternative acts of the 90s.

      ah, in that case, it makes total sense. the acoustics of a concert are generally such that, unless it's being covered by someone who's really fucking professional, can't be properly captured by, say, a camcorder (unless it's a punk show). it's not until the late seventies that recording technology even came close to capturing/recreating the actual listening experience. oh man, now i'm turning into one of those guys... shit.

      Most of those bands are horrible. That is why it was a bad experience. Go see good bands. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or, if you must, listen to some really good live albums by bands that really did their best work in a live context. I am thinking, in this case at least, very specifically of The Who -  <em>Live at Leeds</em>  and Cream... well, there's just tons of great live Cream to pick from... maybe  <em>Wheels of Fire</em> 's live disc? I mean, the cut of "Crossroads" there is classic as fucking hell. Some bands worked much, much better live than they ever could manage to do in the studio. Some bands were much better in the studio. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In all fairness though most shows have crappy sound and if you're hearing a new band for the first time you're unlikely to hear them sounding particularly good and you'll be almost entirely unlikely to make out any lyrics. Seriously people, start mixing well. I'm sick of this crap. There's more to it than just turning everything up to the maximum (and bass off).

      One trick I've found is to stand by the mixing booth. Lots of times the mixing person is not stupid, they just have it mixed for that particular position, and the acoustics are too crappy for it to sound good anywhere else. <br/> 
Some of my best shows, I was standing right beside the mixing booth.

      I'll try that, but I don't know if it'll get over the typical problem of "everything louder than everything else" such that I can typically hear better when I'm standing outside. I've nothing against music being loud (though I did buy some nice earplugs a few years ago), but I think we've reached a point where it's just senselessly loud and for no good reason. It's passed the point where it's loud enough that everyone can hear and that it's, y'know,  <strong>loud</strong>  and moved into the realm where you really do need to bring earplugs just to protect your hearing and, frankly, there's no good reason to keep doing things that way. If we start turning things down just a bit more you'll get more than just boomy low end and slightly amplified high frequencies which, well, when you cut the midrange like that you're really hurting things. Turn it down (say, from 120 dB to around 80 dB) and there will be a flatter frequency response. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've also yet to go to a show where the vocals were even remotely intelligible unless you already knew the song and could kinda fill it in.

      I think this too, and he probably  <em>won't</em>  be considered influential in the future, but it would be humorous if he is.  Perhaps he will have an epiphany soon and realize he is wasting his songwriting talent and set to work on Serious Things, and do for rap what the Beatles did for rock/pop.

      The Asian Art Museum had an excellent Ukiyo-e exhibit about a year ago or so with a nice selection of shunga. I believe the majority of it was from Boston so if you're anywhere near there I strongly advise you avail yourself of their collection. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't want to be a dick about this sort of thing, but seeing it in person really does add to it. Some of the better works had shimmery, glistening semen. I'm not certain that sort of thing would show up well online. <br/>

      I meant modern, but frankly either will really work. I think we might have a bit more rape porn now. The older stuff seemed to be more consensual from what I've viewed of it. Not that they didn't have their share of women looking like they're not enjoying themselves, but yeah... I think we have more Japanese rape-fetish porn now. <br/>

      I believe he is referring to the frequency and the manner in which I go after them. However, while your religious and philosophical rants are based largely on opinion, my hatred of that band sits solidly on the steely foundation of the unquestionable truth that they are a ridiculous band. You need to back your arguments up with facts that no rational person can question, as I have done here.

      None of that is glam, with the exception of Bowie, who was glam for a while in the 70s and remains the poster child for glam rock despite having done numerous other things in the last three decades. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glam: early-mid 70s Bowie. Late 70s Iggy Pop, to some extent. Lou Reed's  <em>Transformer</em> . Gary Glitter. The New York Dolls, to an extent. Brian Eno's early solo output. T.Rex/Marc Bolan. There are more, but this is just off the top of my head. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glam is more than just the look of the performer, though the look is usually very important as well.

      Bowie yes, the rest no. Well, I don't actually know what you'd call The Darkness other than a sad and thankfully short-lived gimmick act.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, it's important to remember that glam is a musical genre, not a hair style. A band that wears make-up isn't necessarily a glam band. It's how they  <em>sound</em>  that determines that. Anyway, start with  <em>Transformer</em>  and make your way to T. Rex's  <em>Electric Warrior.</em>  If you like those, then we can really get down to business.

      That is because Queen was so perfect for Highlander that if Queen didn't exist already the would need to have been created for it. <br/>

      They also used the Hendrix cover of "All Along the Watchtower" rather than the Dylan original as was quoted in the book. They used in a "going to storm the castle" sort of manner when Nite Owl and Rorschach are approaching Karnak. It felt terrible and out of place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They also put in "99 Luftbaloons" in likely because it was from the 80s and about nuclear war even though it was totally out of place and was played at a really inappropriate time (I always hear 80s pop music when I go to four-star restaurants, they are inextricably linked in the minds of all people) and for no real reason.

      I don't think the extended version will be able to fix the flaws I saw in it as they're flaws in what was presented and how it was done, not just in things that were missing (aside from not mentioning Kitty Gennovese, that is crucial as all hell... one interview with Rorshach was not enough, I suspect that is something added back in though), but I'd suggest that anyone who has not yet seen it or who is even remotely on the fence wait for the extended cut. I kind of wish I had waited because now I have very little desire to see it again.

 <em>Wig in a Box</em>  seemed like it would be better, but I felt a bit unimpressed with most of it. I mean, You've got Spoon, They Might Be Giants, Imperial Teen, Frank Black, The Breeders, Sleater-Kinney w/ Fred Schneider, The Bens, Bob Mould, Yo La Tengo w/ Yoko Ono... the damn thing ought to be astounding as fuck, but it's not. It's just sort of good in a few places (Frank Black's cover of "Sugar Daddy" and Spoon's cover of "Tear Me Down" probably top my list), but not the sort of alt-rock orgasm you'd be expecting. <br/>

      I know, it's a great album, I just went off a bit there for some reason. <br/>

I liked the movie a hell of a lot though and I am going to continue saying you're entirely wrong for just wanting to watch the songs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I first saw it I was living in Manhattan, KS which is around 15 minutes away from Junction City. It is really like that. John Cameron Mitchell knows this all too well as his dad was in the Army and he lived there for a while. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you just want the songs without the story that gives them meaning and purpose then you're a terrible person or, at the very least, a philistine.

      If Tupac and Biggie still lived Lil Wayne wouldn't have a reason to exist because if they got to this point they would be doing raps renouncing the gangsta' way of life (Tupac was already headed that way anyway). <br/>

Imagine a world with ODB still alive, though. I mean, THINK ABOUT IT. Lil Wayne wouldn't have even been  <em>born</em> , and if he did he would still have nothing on Dirt McGirt. He was  <em>crazy</em> .
