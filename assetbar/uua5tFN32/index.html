      I'm pretty sure "tattie" in this context is a colloquial word for potato. Thus, tough potatoes. I'd guess that it's a phrase that entered American vernacular through Irish immigants, but the R words been thrown around here too much as it is.

      Damn. In the UK (or at least England) you have playgroup or nursery, at about 3-4, which is sort of to get you to start socializing with large groups of little kids, then you start Primary school with Reception which is the first year of actual education as opposed to just fingerpainting or whatever, at age 4-5, then Year 1, age 5-6, Year 2 age 6-7, Year 3 age 7-8, Year 4 age 8-9, Year 5 age 9-10 and then Year 6 age 10-11. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then you start secondary school with Year 7 and continue the cycle up to Year 11 when you take your GCSEs at age 16, then you can leave school if you want to (although I heard they're changing it?), or you can stay on for Sixth Form up to Year 13 and do A levels, or you can go to another school's Sixth Form (like I did), or you can go to a college and do A levels there, or you can go to a college and do a vocational course. Then you may or may not decide to go to university, usually at age 18 depending on whether you repeated any years or took a gap year or whatever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And now you know lots of stuff about the British education system. Any questions?

      College is "further education" and university is "higher education". You can go to college at like age 16 but you can't go to uni until you're 18. There's probably more important distinctions but I'm really hungover.

      I think that's what it's supposed to be pronounced like. It looks as though there's an accent over the second i. <br/>

I'm not quite sure what hellofditties is so outraged about.

      Once upon a time, I believe it was right around first or second grade, our music teacher said the n-word during class. I'm not quite sure why. She was talking about... John Phillips Sousa? Apparently he wrote some music for... slaves? Maybe she was quoting from a book? I don't quite remember, but she definitely said that word. I'm not sure if I'd heard that word before but I knew there was something wrong with it and I was confused about the whole thing because the teacher was one of my favorites. I went home and I guess the issue wouldn't settle peacefully in my subconscious because later that Dad and I were reviewing for a spelling test and he asked me to spell some word and out of my mouth comes: "N... I... G... G... E... R.."
