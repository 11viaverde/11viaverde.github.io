      Ray is spot on though, this has certainly happened to me.  A lady and her family walks into the store where I work, and after talking for a spell I ask where she's from.  "Well..." she hesitates, "just outside of London." <br/> 
"Really?  My father grew up near Esher (just south of London)." <br/> 
She then realized I knew quite a bit more about England than she had anticipated, as her eyes lit up when I said Esher.  After a quick chortle to herself, she says "Well, I'm  <em>from</em>  Esher." <br/> 
We began discussing how lovely the area is and so forth and so on, her husband bought a load of stuff, and we all had a laugh.  While it was a stroke of coincidence that we had connections to the same area of England, her initial hesitancy to say where she specifically lived was proven to be unneeded. <br/> 
To be fair, Ray didn't ask Waterbury whether he was a Chelsea fan or loved EastEnders or anything though, did he?

      I dunno about that. I've never claimed to be a Londoner. A lot of Americans think all Brits are from London, because when you tell them where you live, they say, "Never heard of it. Is it near London?" and you say "Well, it's about 250 miles," and they say, "So it's near London."

      I'm from Greater London. At uni (particularly earlier on in the year), everyone always asks everyone where they're from, and I say either London or Greater London. This satisfies most people, but if I meet someone who is  <em>also</em>  from London, they'll ask whereabouts, I'll tell them, and they'll say "THAT'S NOT LONDON! YOU DON'T LIVE IN LONDON! I LIVE MORE IN LONDON THAN YOU DO! IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT I BE MORE LONDON THAN EVERYONE ELSE!" <br/>

      I may be wrong, but to me, the fact that he thanks  <em>Your Grace</em>  rather than  <em>Your Highness</em>  indicates he may work for the Vatican rather than the Queen. <br/>

      I'm from England and I've never claimed Londonage. mostly, as this comic says, cause it sounds cooler if I say I'm from Southampton. also I know a little about American geography so I'm the worst for asking if it's near this or that city, especially if it's in the north or west...
