I'm sorry, really. It really wasn't intended to be the cool kids, just the people that I'm most familiar with and the ones who changed their icons the earliest. I mean if I weren't the one who made it, I probably wouldn't be on there either. So please don't feel bad about not being included on a crappy image made with MS Paint and a photo taken from the Ikea website.

      I am sorry about this autre, but we can no longer be steady dates, as you love Dr. Phil, and I am of the mind that he is a terrible psychologist. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To be fair, my disdain for him also stems from his seeming inability to deny his percieved infallibility. It is basically a terrible thing to speak to a patient and have them think that everything you say cannot be false. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also he spends nowhere near enough time with people to make an adequate assessment, at least from a clinical perspective. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Front: I am sorry I got so steamed about Dr. Phil. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Inside: It's just that he is so terrible at helping people that have problems. <br/>

Also, tell me more of this House of Hate!

      Awesome work, achilles.  I especially like the chorus of spinynorman appreciators, and the Doritos-thieving giant sea lice.  This weekend we experienced a remarkable phenomenon on assetbar, and I'm glad you took the time to document it.   <br/>

      wow, that was really cool achilleselbow!  Very nice of you!  You are rad!  Gee I feel undeserving to be included what with how socially awkward and anxious I am about making connections with people, or avicons, as the case may be.  I've only been hanging out here for a little bit but yeah I do feel like I know you all a little better, and maybe you all know me just a little better, maybe even a little more than you might like sometimes heh heh. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What is really neat, however, is to see folks really connecting in some meaningful way, and to see everyone's enthusiasm for connecting, as spontaneously exemplified by the hand-face incident.  This is probably what sky-net felt like when it spontaneously gained sentience.  What a beautiful thing!  I'm in my 30's, so I remember when the internet was comprised more of enthusiasts and intellectuals and was much less crowded with idiots like me.... eh heh eh.  To quote Clinton Fein, it's becoming "a world of superficial sound bytes dominated by a generation absorbed with the self and the surface of things." <br/> 
 <br/> 
But ya know what, all the frickin' APIs and giga-byte hogging poorly developed so-called 'social networking' market capitalization web sites out there don't equal the power of some weekend assetbar hack, when it's charged with a few good compadres.  You all is good people.  To quote Alan Kay:  "The real romance is out ahead and yet to come.  The computer revolution hasn't started yet." <br/> 
 <br/> 
So in the spirit of continuing a little bit this experiment of sharing and connecting, I have posted a few random pics that I think are cute, and a few of myself as well.  I don't mean to be too forward or insinutating, but I reposted Achilleselbow's tribute too, with an open offer to add to it if anyone wants.  Hope y'all like them.  Ahh.. who am I kidding!  It's not like I need to know if you care! XD <br/>

      No Comply is my favorite skateboard trick name.  Kids today probably don't know what it is.  It was huge for about 10 months back in '89 or so.  Then people  <em>never did it again</em> , at least while I was still skating. <br/>

      1.Take piece of paper fit for writing on. (decide on quality of paper according to desired quality of card) <br/> 
2.Fold paper in two. <br/> 
3.Fold paper in two again, in the other direction. (This makes for a less flimsy card that is easier to get to stand up. No one likes a card that just lies down on the desk or table. That is depressing and they'll think you shouldn't have bothered.) <br/> 
4.Write and/or draw stuff on the paper. Make it clever if you can. If you can't well try to be honest at least. No one likes a lying card. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also you can use cardboard instead but everyone can find some blank paper lying around the house if they look hard enough. Besides if you already have a supply of appropriate card-making materials then you probably do not need this basic Guide.

      I really gave this "real face/hand face" avaticon thing a lot of thought, to the point of creating a "pogo2" membership to try out my mug shot without changing all the old, more acerbic "pogo" posts going back through time, some of which were pretty shitty, depending on whether I had depression or not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then I remembered by first membership had been in my real name -- imagine my innocence/bravery/naivite -- until I became slightly embarrased at some of my early comments and asked Onstad if he could change that (no, sorry), so I started anew as pogo and pretty much said whatever I wanted under that disguise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fine, I got a lot of shit out of my system, and came to love and respect my fellow Achewoodians, and now I want to be me, in the open, honest and true, edgy and sappy, whatever dude, deal with it.  I have Lifelock on my personal treasure, and God on my honor.  Lo though I trapse through the Valley of Achewood, I shall fear no evil, for thine is the kingdom of free expression, hail Fallujah, USA! USA!

      Well this one time... <br/> 
 <br/> 
*cue harp music and misting screen* <br/> 
 <br/> 
In my first (or second? So much Vodka) year of Uni, there was this girl I was seeing, and she was pretty down on her luck, and the very next day a horny other girl shows up. Well, one thing led to another. You can pretty much guess what they did. It wasn't too cool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm not against gays. I'm actually pretty open minded once you get to know me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it is just that if I see girls making out, I am reminded of heartbreak. I guess it is dependent on context, you guys can lez out if you just GOT to.

      I think there are a lot of dudes who wouldn't really consider lezzing out cheating but would on the contrary encourage it. Unless of course she then decides to permanently change her orientation and dumps you. Then it sucks.

      Being heteroflexible, I fail to see the difference between cheating with a dame or a fellow.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really wouldn't mind if someone that I was seeing ran the bases with other peeps, as long as I wasn't kept in the dark about it (I am aware this is not common), but being secretive about it infers... dishonesty? There is probably a better word. Anyway, there was a "lipstick on the collar, lady on her breath" moment, she said she wanted to exclusively see this other girl, I was all "cool", and later realised that the hollow feeling in my guts that lasted a while was because I liked this girl. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically I am like Pavlov's dog, but instead of bells and food, it's chicks lezing out on Cuervo, and me sobbing while watching Love Actually on repeat.

      Ah, well heteroflexible might explain it I guess. I'm just saying that if you're entirely straight, it's hard to see girls as sexual competition. But of course being deceived and subsequently dumped is never cool at all. In any case, the saddest thing about all this is that you are now forever incapable of enjoying the idea of chicks lezzing out, which is probably even worse than not being able to enjoy Beethoven's Ninth.

He never wanted us to worry about him -- always said he'd be fine -- and I'll always remember how during on of the later heart attacks, he offered to walk himself to the ER so we wouldn't have to miss the ending of Monk . . .

In OTHER news - Jesus, arguably,  <strong>could have actually had red hair</strong> , if it was passed down that far from the line of David (who, by tradition, arguably  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110416101128/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_hair#Religious_and_mythological_traditions">also had red hair</a> ).  Possible, but pretty doubtful given that it's a recessive gene and the general complexion in the area at the time was pretty damned dark.

      Oh man, in all seriousness, I am super-glad you said that. Earlier today I read all of the replies to my post yesterday, and saw what I thought was a regular thing transform into this thing in which I am a creep. I was considering writing something along the lines of "oh but that is not what it is like!" but realised it was  <em>yesterday's post</em> , and in the world of assetbar, was as good as dead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I basically meant that if there has been flirtation with a lady, that has been returned, then for no discernable reason, you get politely shunned, I usually like to try and figure out why, just so I know it's not that I smell like carpet, or have hair between my teeth or something. I did not want to sound like a date rapist.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>I cannot stress this enough</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, they are not even my aviators! I took them from an Israeli fellow. I was going for a Jesse "The Devil" Hughes look, and instead, looked like a fat-headed twat.

      yeah I have a similar phobia - when I am swimming I am afraid my foot is going to hit something bad.  Not sure what... well I'm afraid of the water in general, always have been, even more so since that time I was sailing in rough weather and was trying to right my sailboard and drifted so close to the shore that my foot hit the bottom of the lake, and I was like 'oh my god, it's a something!' and it was only a fraction of a second later that I realized that hey, I had simply gotten close enough to shore to get my feet on the lake bottom, but that was all it took, since that moment there is this permanent and specific phobia implanted in my mind, no different than when a severed penis bumps against your lips while you're drinking from the milk bottle.  It only takes a fraction of a second to consciously realize that hey, it's probably just a severed penis, and the milk is all steralized/pasturized anyway, so it's really not a big deal...  but... in that fraction of a second, that neuropic synapse is permanently formed, and from then on, you need an oral barrier to be able to truly enjoy chugging milk from a bottle.  Such is life. <br/>

      I have that same phobia (the lake thing, not the penis thing). Even if my foot just brushes a clump of seaweed or such as a basic thing like a shell, I freak out something terrible. I have to be thoroughly convinced that I am treading in clean water. Now, hear this. When I was a wee lassie, I went to camp, and we had kayaking. Now, I do not trust lake water  <strong>at all</strong> , and some kid held a plasic bag underwater, and I, convinced that it was a jellyfish, was uncomfortable going near him and his stinging friend. He started laughing at me, and he threw the plasic bag/"jellyfish" into my kayak, causing me to throw a fit, because I thought he threw a goddamn jellyfish on my leg. Now, this is a legitimate fear, yes? Still, for the rest of the summer, I was called "Jelly Belly" and (this is a direct quote, by the way) "a big fat jellyfish who's so fat you can't even fit in the ocean!" Yeah. Original. So for the rest of the summer none of the kids wanted to be my friend and mocked me no matter what I did and made my wee little self cry on a daily basis. So goes the story of the Worst Fucking Summer. <br/>

      I'm not well-versed in current slang:  Is Beef using the word "Sick" here in the more recent meaning of something that is good?  Or does he use it in the more conventional way as something that is not good at all? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, do people still say "Phat?"  They never seem to in Achewood, though Beef thinks filing taxes early is "dope," which I also took to be somewhat passe.  (Imagine your own diacritical mark or whatever on "passe.")

      I think "sick" isn't necessarily still used by the origninators, but it is being kept alive by the new booming poker culture. They use "sick" a lot, essentially it means "crazy," as in "That is some crazy shiz to be happening!" when something statistically unlikely happens.

      Fellas, what I need to understand, and which remains unclear, is:  Does Beef think that dudes will LIKE to receive cards from other dudes, or not?  I for one would enjoy getting a card related to times of dudes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have lately heard dudes such as Moto-X riders or skaters or whatever say that some move is "Siiiiiick", by which they mean freaky good, but Beef in the main does not employ the slang terms of these people.  I did not know that poker players were also using this term, but many of them strike me as people who wish they could do radical BMX tricks.

      I use the word "sick" all the time to mean like, good or awesome or whatever. I sort of assumed Beef was using it with the same meaning, but then again he is supposed to be from Californian Circumstances, and I am a white British upper-working-class girl who just tends to get infected with the language of the "cool kids" every now and then, so who knows, maybe are meanings are completely different. <br/>

(I also say "bare" and "jank" if anyone here is familiar with those terms.)

      I totally read it the other way at first, but on further reflection I think  <em>sick</em>  means  <em>good</em>  here because we have established that a  <em>dude</em>  is someone you have had times with, not just a synonym for  <em>guy</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, yeah, with the dictionary meaning of sick this card would still sell.  Whenever my dudes and I have to buy each other cards for an occasion, it's always  <strong>Happy Bar Mitzvah, You Are Now a Man!</strong>  or  <strong>To My Favorite Step-Aunt</strong> , just to show that you're not about to get all mushy on him.  A card that essentially said, "You just got a greeting card from another man!  Ha, Ha!" would fill a certain niche for men who are uncomfortable being in the same room with their feelings.

 <em>For the uninitiated</em> : IRC is an oldschool chat program.  You'll need to download any of a slew of clients to connect.  A lot of people find  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110416101128/https://www.mirc.com/">mIRC</a>  to be quick and easy.

      Oh, wow, I was actually at a bead shop yesterday, with Kate and two other girls that I don't love. But it was a fun time anyway. I looked at the beads until I could no longer convince myself that they were sweets, then busied myself with examining the pliers and superglue near the entrance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All the time, I was humming Cliffs of Dover under my breath and praying that my testicles didn't implode.

      It has recently come to my attention that "hook up" has lost practically all semantic meaning. It can mean anything from "make out" to "have sex," and it can even mean "have sex with someone with whom you are in a committed relationship."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It has been theorized to me that this is because it allows girls to make themselves seem less slutty and guys to make themselves seem more studly. That's a really interesting social function and all, but I would really appreciate some linguistic precision.

      I don't know what Tom Wolfe says about anything, but the base system was something I could get behind. Why has it fallen out of style? It may not have always been the suavest way to describe sexual encounters, but it was certainly steamier than "hooking up."

      Being Australian, I was raised without access to the base system or the term "make-outs". We had to make do with pashing or the less common snogging. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My understanding of the bases was: <br/> 
1st- Staring. <br/> 
2nd- Headbutting. <br/> 
3rd- Doing it in an elevator. <br/> 
4th- A Dutch oven. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I assume I am wrong- could someone from one of the older colonies explain them to me?

      I would second that, but it would really be just out of selfishness. I mean we could do a bunch of separate regional things, but that wouldn't be nearly as cool. <br/>

I mean am I wrong in assuming that people wouldn't be willing to actually fly somewhere? If they were, I guess we could put up a bunch of options and vote on them. If we could get Onstad to make an official thing of it I suppose it'd be in California.

      I think this is a common misconception about New York. I mean rent is definitely more expensive, but in terms of everything else, there's plenty of cheap stuff if you know where to look, like $2 falafels, $1 pizza slices, and bars that give you an entire free medium-size pizza with every drink. I guess hotels might be expensive, but I don't really know that it'd be that much more than any other major city.

      "In addition to consecutive league titles, the Dynamo advanced to the semifinal of the preseason CONCACAF Champions Cup, and semifinal of the first-ever SuperLiga. Dynamo star Pat Onstad became the first goalkeeper to win three MLS Cup Championships, and Onstad was a force behind the team's modern-day, professional team sports shutout record of 727 minutes without allowing a goal. Dwayne De Rosario became the league's first two-time MLS Cup MVP. Aside from the team's on-field success in 2006 and 2007, the Dynamo enjoyed three consecutive record-setting crowds of over 30,000 toward the end of last season."

      OK, but as someone who has spent what I now see has been over TWO HOURS reading this and the previous strips' comments, and has enjoyed them immensely, but who also doesn't maybe comment so often, and, too, is a little bit older than the average Assetbarian, I want to know: is it too late for me to get on the handface avataricon bandwagon?  <br/>

I think maybe it is. Well, there's always the next big paradigm shift, isn't there?

      Like the 1960's, or the 1790's or whenever the hell folk invented fire, this was a revolution.  A moment where the normal hegemony of a simple webcomic message board was overturned to create a  <em>movement.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Those of us who missed it are forever impoverished of the experience, but can still live in the shining new world it's created. <br/>

      I guess it's hard to overlook the whole age gap thing sometimes, even though I am almost sure that you're not a stalker. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously though, if that's really your age you're probably the oldest person here, and though you'd probably prefer not to have attention called to that, I think it's awesome. I mean I doubt most of us will still be able to 'connect with the youth' by the time we're 40, let alone 59. I can't help but feel like you should be giving us insightful advice on life and such since you probably understand our mindset better than any of our parents do, on account of your enjoying this comic. Ok, this is getting awkward, my apologies.

      No apologies needed, I was just thinking about that aspect, of how it would have been so cool in my youth to have an adult I could feel comfortable talking with.  The Nazis who ran my high school could give a fuck about anything but haircuts (this was during the Beatle days).  Not get get maudlin here, but my dad died of a heart attach when I was 12, and I pretty much raised myself, so that's probably part of why I can relate to you street urchins and geekoid shutins so well.  Please consider me 19 at heart, but with another 40 years of hard knocks to share, and who's got the drugs, man?
