      My favorite part of this one is Beef's instinctual response to the 4 AM phone call. It's not funny per se, but it's a really nice, concise way to remind us of his fretful nature and strange relationship with his deadbeat brother. As with the best of achewood, it suggests much more than it says & establishes depth of character in an unobtrusive way. I just thought that was neat.

      I do that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Earlier this week I saw I got an email from home and I just thought, "Dad had a heart attack."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
He didn't, though. But my great uncle did die later this week, so that's odd.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Similarly, today I got a text message from my roomie and thought, "I left the oven on and something is on fire." Turns out Ford is coming out with a Bullitt Edition Mustang instead. But I couldn't stop thinking about it, so instead I came up with a long rambling reason to call him back (it involved the garbage disposal) and then mentioned, as a hilarious joke, what I had presumed his text message would have been about the oven, but hey, just as a total curiosity-thing, could you ah... ah, check on the oven and just, y'know, just... see? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then he paused and said, "...that's actually why you called, isn't it." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Y...yeah," I said. "Yeah, it is." <br/> 
 <br/> 
He sighed, said, "Damn it," and hung up.

      When my kid sister was on vacation with my mother and my mother's boyfriend, every time the phone rang or they said on the news that Something Bad had happened, I thought her plane had crashed. (Until a week in when we stopped getting calls and I was sure they'd taken her to Mexico forever.)

      Whenever I get a call from home I'm sure it's that my dad's died, or the dog's died, or something else.  And I always fret when people I know are on trips that they've had an accident or something, and  <em>that's</em>  why they haven't called. <br/>

      I received a 4:30 AM call several months ago, believing for sure it was my ex in dire straights. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 No, it was my closest companion of childhood years, drunk as a lord, asking me where he could find girls at such an hour... "filthy whores", to be more specific. He insisted that I was the one who would know where to find them, their names, where they liked to be tickled. Many minutes passed as I tried to explain to him that, as I was in South Carolina, and he was in Chicago, and I had never lived in Chicago, that his expectations were rather unrealistic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 At long last, I suggested he go drive through a bad neighborhood, fanning money out the window, knowing full well that there was every possibility he would act on my horrible advice.

      I once received a 3 AM phone call from a person I had not known or spoken to since pre-school and who I could only vaguely remember. This was while I was in college. I have absolutely no idea how he even knew where I was or who I was. I basically know him because my mother insists that we had been friends. He was drunk and wanted a ride home. I eventually had to unplug the phone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still have no idea how he even knew my number or, given that I have an incredibly generic name, that it was even me.

      I have received many a 3am phone call. Mostly from drunken friends, who are so drunk that I am not sure if they are speaking English or just slurring random syllables into the phone. Sometimes I'm not even sure of who's calling. <br/> 
There needs to be some sort of call filter that just detects when people are drunk and sends them to voicemail or something.
