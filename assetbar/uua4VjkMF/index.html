      I COMPLETELY AGREE <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I  <em>can</em>  think of a rationale, sort of: If they use BBcode, they can categorically deactivate everything in angle brackets, making it really easy to prevent screwy script injection exploits and blah blah blah. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But this isn't a very good reason, I think. It would be only marginally more difficult to allow the obvious tags like <i> and <b> and disallow DHTML and other things likely to fuck with their shit. And, anyway, it seems like they could just leave their HTML-donker intact and parse <i> and <b> tags themselves in exactly the same way they're handling BBcode now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It would be pretty great if they did this, I think, and allowed, in addition to the current BBcode tags, equivalent HTML tags. Any assetbar dudes watching?

      Exactly. Allow A, B, I, U, STRIKE, and IMG and you've got basically everything you need. Add filtering for too-wide elements and you're done. <br/>

Then again, I've been waiting for LiveJournal to add an HTML-aware spellchecker for about four years now, so maybe we'll have to wait a bit . . . :-(

      <em>OK!</em>  Enough with the nerdistry, already. I need an English major. My question is this - are the gerunds referred to in this strip of the linguistic variety? If so, please help me to understand the joke. If not, what are gerunds? Please help. I love this strip so much as it is, but feel as though I'm missing something.

      Dropped gerunds are typical in Ebonics, which Teodor is mocking here. A dropped gerund is a gerund (words like running jumping etc) minus the "ing" suffix, so, for example, "I've got to tip the Panamanian boy who is vacuuming the gerunds from the Escalade's carpet" becomes "I got to tip the little Panama boy what vacuums my dropped gerunds out of the bottom of my Escalade."

      Disagree.  Beef's speech isn't in weird patterns, it is just understated and low.  Who in Hollywood does understated and low?  William H Macey or perhaps Steve Buschemi come to mind, but neither is perfect.

      Just to elaborate on this, it's implied Cornelius was born in Cambridge, as that's where he first lived. Whether that's in Cambridge, MA or the famous English university town, I'd assume the latter. <br/>

      As uncomfortable as I have always been with the thought of an animated Achewood ( <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021357/https://youtube.com/watch?v=nH432AFoDU8">those types of things never turn out right</a> ), this is a fun game and, in spite of myself, I've definitely spent some time thinking about it. One or two of these ideas were mentioned by others at various points - if I could remember who said what I'd credit them. Here are the possibilities that I (and they) have considered: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Beef</strong>  - Crispin Glover <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Cornelius</strong>  - Michael Gambon (Please everybody, stop this Kelsey Grammer nonsense. The man's got no class.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Teodor</strong>  - Adrien Brody (I understand that Teodor's Belarusian and Brody isn't, but I know a few people of Russian decent who've lived in the states their entire life and who, unlike their parents, speak perfect American English, so this doesn't feel far-fetched to me). <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Molly</strong>  -  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021357/https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/theoffice/characters/profile_dawn.shtml">Lucy Davis</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Ray</strong>  -  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021357/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_3000">Andre Benjamin</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Lyle</strong>  - Benicio Del Toro (I realize that Lyle isn't Hispanic, but I think Del Toro could bring a lot of life to the part. Think Fear and Loathing.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Philippe</strong>  - An actual child. By "actual," I guess I mean "not necessarily an actor." Think Charlie Brown Christmas. Like that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Pat</strong>  - David Hyde Pierce <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Lie Bot</strong>  - Christopher Walken ( <em>perfect!</em>  thank you, riazm) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Again, let me stress that I do not wish for this to happen. But if it had to, this would be pretty ideal.   <br/>

      Tuff Gong is a record label that was formed by the reggae group The Wailers in 1970 and named after Bob Marley's nickname. The first single on the label was "Run For Cover" by The Wailers. The Tuff Gong headquarters were located at 56 Hope Road, in Kingston, Jamaica, Bob Marley's home. The location is now home to the Bob Marley Museum. <br/>

      I find the letter-writing process very stressful and often confusing. If I'm mailing something extremely important then sometimes I put the return address on the wrong side of the stamp on the wrong side. One time I mailed a completely empty letter because I was so concerned with the envelope turning out looking nice I forgot that they usually are supposed to hold things, namely letters.
