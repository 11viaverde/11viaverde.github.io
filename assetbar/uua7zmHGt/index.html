      No way, those kids had  <em>power</em> .  They painted "Mystery Machine" on their van, and everywhere they went, they were greeted with mysteries.

      It depends where in Texas you are. In some parts they're grudgingly accepted; my Dallas suburb was about 1/6 Mormon. (Of course, that didn't mean that they were embraced-- the Southern Baptists still thought they were a cult-- but they were tolerated.)  <br/>

      That's a real quandary to me... On one hand, the methods and attitudes of Evangelicals are unbearable to me, such as being threatened by a large Southern boy who had just shotgunned a beer that if I said "goddamn" again he would clock me, and that word should be illegal and only "disrespectful motherfuckers" used it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The irony of the situation was lost on him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, you have Mormons, who believe something so illogical and strange that it almost makes my feet hurt. Also the time a Mormon lady asked me, "What part of the Bible was Jesus in, the Old or the New Testament" doesn't exactly recommend them to Christianity, whether you believe in it or not.  <br/>

If I was to choose who I wanted to be trapped in an elevator with for a day, I'd choose Mormons in a heartbeat, though.

      My Texas comment was a complete non sequitur. I've spent approximately two hours of my life there. To put that even further into perspective, I was in the Lubbock Airport on a layover en route to L.A., so, in truth, I've never even tasted the sweet, sweet Texas air. Add to that the fact that I was, like, eight years old and you get the idea. <br/>

      If you never do anything but vice, she will definitely catch you doing the stereotypical ones.  But are these all the vices she can imagine, or has Onstad self-censored all of a sudden?  There's the somnonanism, the boning (but not lately), the unsavory cake fetish, the hiring of self-mutilating serial killers to scare children, the bribing of public officials to avoid punishment for aforementioned vices, the drinking of really bad tea....    <br/>

      You can deny it; it makes it no less true. This comic illustrates that Ray was constantly henpecked throughout his entire childhood - and beyond. It's not like Gramma K. is calling Roast Beef on the phone to tell him to stay away from ditches. He got out. Ray cannot.

      You know, for a while there in the "Ray was rich as fuck as a kid and Beef ate kleenex sandwiches if he was lucky" series of comics, Ray's mom sounded sort of like some Cosmopolitan bitch. The only store she knew was Neaman Marcus and she bought her kid the nine dollar pizza pocket with seven foot layers of packaging.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But originally she was just some homespun lady who just thought that if Ray is true to his own self then the good Lord will provide. Seems like Sondra is more this version of Ray's momma. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's nice that Onstad knows not to give a fuck and make up shit like an Infinite Crisis or whatever the hell for continuity's sake. I don't know who you are or who you thought you were before, but this Achewood, and in Achewood a long arc in which a demonic banjo drags a closeted gay down a street can suddenly be interrupted with baby info and pictures of cocktails, weenie dogs, and sketches, and you will just have to fucking manage.

      There was one recently that really pissed me off - everyone knows the Simpsons don't age, but they also know that Marge and Homer met in high school in the 70's... But in this recent episode apparently Homer was a kid in the 90's and started a famous grunge band that was a huge hit.  <br/>

I know most of the writers grew up watching the Simpsons, so they're basically kids, but still, you should  <em>at least fucking try.</em> <br/>

      I saw that, and had the same thought, but then i realized that comic books do the same damn thing all the time.  Every once in awhile, they gotta reestablish that Batman was a kid at the right time to be thirty today (In ten years, he will have grown up with the Power Rangers and Pokemon).  Hell, James Bond did some similar stuff with the last movie. (Connery Bond would have no idea why he'd be bashed in the nuts for a computer password, but this takes place at the beginning of his career).  Like it or not, the Simpsons have been around long enough for a retcon to be necessary, just to establish that the family is experiencing things in 2008 instead of 1995. <br/>

      This has been exactly my take on Achewood for some time.  I love the same thing about it that I love about Krazy Kat (well, there are differences too, of course) -- it's a comic strip!  You're not fettered to reality at all, take advantage of it!  I don't mind seeing the evolution of characters, and I don't even mind seeing Chris play with characters at the expense of continuity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Achewood is a crazy, crazy train, and we are all just passengers.

      Echoing this sentiment, but also, I don't think that there's a strong contradiction between the old and new evidence about Ray's mom. I think it's pretty plausible that she was simply very wealthy and liked to dote on her child and shop very upscale while at the same time maturing into a more "conservative" incarnation. Actually it seems to occur naturally in real life fairly often, come to think of it. Don;t you agree? It might not even be Onstad changing his vision so much as just deciding what direction things eventually went it.

      I don't know. Bloom County had its moments, and it was certainly one of the most unique and interesting strips overall. But large swaths of the comics were just not that entertaining. I think Calvin and Hobbes wins both in peak quality and consistency. Far Side was excellent, but I can't really compare it to Calvin and Hobbes. It's just a different thing.

      foxtrot has always seemed mediocre. better than the majority of stuff on the comics pages, but never great. the art is lazy and the writing is formulaic. i  <em>like</em>  it, but i wouldn't  <em>praise</em>  it. like AC/DC.

      yeah, individual characters in achewood are copied and pasted, but <br/> 
a) the facial expressions are always treated with care, particularly eyebrows; whereas characters in foxtrot have like four stock facial expressions <br/> 
b) different characters look completely different; whereas the only distinguishing elements of foxtrot characters are height, hair, and glasses <br/> 
 <br/> 
i'm not saying achewood has the most impressive art around, but i think it's much better than foxtrot's

An excerpt: "Hmmm, Mom left me home alone. Better go through the medicine cabinet and drink all the medicine for no good reason. Wait, what's this? A note telling me not to 'drink any medicines'? Thank God! I was about to do that. I was about to drink all the medicines and kill myself because I'm retarded... Ah, dinnertime. There's a tupperware container full of pasta in the fridge, but it's cold! How will I ever heat it up? I guess I'll just starve and die because I'm not competent to warm pasta. Whoa! A note telling me to put the container in the microwave and press EASY MINUTE! Thanks, note! You saved my life! I hope that when my mom comes home she asks me some very specific, humiliating questions about my changing body."

      Hmmm.  Beef seems like the fatalistic type to refer to the "Cork and Cask" as the "Cork and Casket" (like Ray calls that one Mexican place "El Guapo"), but he would not be a strange voice to Sondra.  Todd certainly isn't afraid to drive drunk, but he would try to hit Ray up for at least a hundy and keep the change.  Lyle is a likely suspect; he calls Mr. Beam by a familiar name, and expresses the right amount of distress at his passing.  But is he the man of action who would volunteer to procure a replacement, or would he pin the $20 and his ID to Philippe's shirt and send him instead?  It's a head-scratcher.

      Grace Jones usually eats animals about the size of a house cat, but larger food items are not unknown: she has been known to take down adult Deer and Gazelle. Prey is swallowed whole, and may take anywhere from several days or even weeks to fully digest. Despite her intimidating size and muscular power, Grace Jones is generally not dangerous to humans.

      I think you need to re-evaluate your concept of necessity, at least as regarding a webcomic about stuffed animals and talking cats. Also, it's pretty evident that the strip is just as much about Ray as it is about his mom. Besides, I always liked the minor characters better than the main ones (oh how I miss Mr. Cropes).

Minor Characters = Awesome. <br/>

Reason being: you don't have to develop them as much.  And then when you  <em>do</em>  develop them, it makes the audience feel like they're learning some special secret history.

      This is a good strip. That said, I remember writing a long time ago about how dumbrella, where the old achewood forum used to be, wasn't so bad. I got lamed about it and some folks were all, 'no man, it was shit', 'the whole thing went to hell', etc. I couldn't remember when it went downhill, I think I stopped going there for awhile but still read the strip.  Unfortunately, it seems like assetbar is starting to, although not fully, slip back again to awhile back when it was just... retarded here for about a month.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Uhm. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had a bad day and a lot to drink. What I'm trying to say, I think, is everyone just chill out and enjoy reading achewood because that's why we're all here. If we hated it, we certainly wouldn't have signed  up for an account, and if we think a strip is bad, stating a reason or a critique shouldn't be considered an asshole move. This is also the internet and is generally where we all go to forget that all we do is sit in cubicles or draw pictures all day so please lets carry on.
