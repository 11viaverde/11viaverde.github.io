      It's true. My hat is of weak morals. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Walking to work this morning, my hat totally gave me hat hair. Dick. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And once before, this same hat, which is warm and friendly, contained my keys for 16 hours while I desperately searched, almost turning to a locksmith to change the locks on my car and apartment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And there have been several times when I have caught my hat stealing eggs and broccoli from the frigde late at night. I know he stays up cooking foul smelling omelettes and then leaving the dishes in the sink, stewing in a fetid clump of oil and egg and onion, going rancid through the night, waking me with a stench not unlike unwashed socks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In a more subtle case, my hat has employed passive agressive arguments in conversations of which he is scarcely a part. My girlfriend and I will talk about movies and my hat will butt it: "Come on, you know Polanksi wasn't trying to hint at pathos. Dude, you're smarter than this!" implying that his position is one gleaned from high intelligence and not opinion. He does so snidely and smugly, leading me to doubt my positions and my wisdom. I dismiss him, because he is made of wool, but inside, I am left to question plaintively, cyclically. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I cannot distance myself from this hat of weak morals. This hat who grew up in a broken home of a drunken tweed father and an indifferent woolen sock, along with his 3 older hat sisters who ignored him after the age of 5 and left him starved for attention, starved for knowledge and love. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At night, I see my hat in an unfolded lump, I know he waits cautiously until I sleep, I dream of him stealing off in the night with my television, pawning it and travelling the earth like a vagabond atop the head of a bum or the skull of a poor child who picks him up at a thrift store, unknowing, unsuspecting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm embarrassed too.

      Me too. Vlad is the fucking King, you all know this. When has Vlad ever been wrong about anything? He knew Pat was a threat to him in the Subway game, so he played him like the world's sexiest guitar and had him commit involuntary manslaughter. Once Pat is good and scared in prison with Nice Pete, he has Ray take him the lock picks in the cigars, then honor-binds him to working in his Subway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then when they're giving Roast Beef the makeover, Vlad cuts to the heart of the problem. He describes Beef's one time sad home life more succintly in a few sentences than anybody else could hope to, forcing Beef to consider the whole thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Vlad knows what happens to couches when they're gone. And he knows the only thing you can do is let out your emotions, cry a stream of tears so fierce as to rival the streams of alcohol you will consume in dealing with that very sorrow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Vlad ALWAYS has an appropriate haircut for the situation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Vlad doesn't let anything stop him from having a raunchy sex fantasy while answering a phone call an elderly, worried mother placed to her missing son.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know about all of you, but I dream about living Vlad's life. And you all should too. There's a reason he's called the Make Out King. It's because he's taken life, and he's made his sweet, sweet baby.

      <em>Vlad assured him that the time was propitious and Vlad knew the world. <br/>
<br/>
Vlad knew what games the children on street-corners are playing- games that all other grown-ups have long since forgotten. Vlad knew what old people by firesides are thinking of, though no one has asked them in years. Vlad knew what young men hear in the rattling of the drums and the tooting of the pipes that makes them leave their homes and go to be soldiers- and he knew the half-eggcupful of glory and the barrelful of misery that await them. Vlad could look at a smart attorney in the street and tell you what he had in his coat-tail pockets. And all that Vlad knew made him smile; and some of what he knew made him laugh out loud; and none of what he knew wrung from him so much as ha'pennyworth of pity.<br/>
<br/>
So when Vlad told his freind, "You take look at universe and say, 'Nope. You get sloppy. I fix,'" Mr Smuckles believed him.</em>

      Okay, sje, you know I like you, but it is actually getting annoying. Not so much the actual meme itself, but the fact that you make a ton of posts for no other reason, and that you seem to actually still think it's funny.

      I am beginning to get a little bored with the non-stop arcs we have been getting.  Most of what I like about Achewood is the variety we used to see.  I enjoyed how many characters would get air time by the variety of short stories Chris would tell.  The Party at least had appearances by every character, and each of their appearances was handled well.  I guess I just don't feel where this is going. <br/>

      I would prefer the KoOkY one-offs like "Morally Challenging Hot Sauce" or Phillipe Lie-Bot and the Skeleton, or "When Friends Talk" (Kings were  <em>raw</em> ) or the one about Ray being a bitch about parking.  Those are my favorites, when there's either a surreal, anti-humor, non-punchline ending or when Ray and Beef just bounce off each other for a while.  Either way, they're both totally based on character interaction and development, and that plus dialogue are Onstad's strongest points anyway.

      But that just wasn't up to snuff, and it was definitely because of the tour.  Give Chris some time to recharge after Christmas and I foresee a return to form.  Hopefully less arc-heavy, unless we get some kind of GOF reprise.

Not according to art theory; artists agonize because as soon as they release their art to the public, the public owns it.  The artist cannot possess his or her work.  The collective consciousness is in charge.  What people think of art is all art really has going for it.

      But we don't make it, so no matter how much we protest, it's still up to Chris whether he bends to our will or not.  When you change because your public wants you to, isn't that selling out?  But then on the flip side, you want to satisfy your loyal fans.  Flip that flip side and you have "Loyal fans should welcome change either way."  And so the argument goes round and round.

      You bring up a good point, and one we need to consider.  Characters change.  Where would we be if Onstad still had Connie lamenting about AIDS, or Teodor and Lyle punching Phillipe in the gut?  If this is indeed an evolution of the comic or  characters (I still think it's typical Vlad), then we need to roll with it because it might belong to us as fans but as the creator, Onstad has more say than we do.

      I dunno.  I used to work with a Russian guy, 5' tall (I'm 6'5", much hilarity ensued when we carried heavy objects together) who would often punctuate his musings with "bullshit".   <br/> 
 <br/> 
As in, "In Russia, Russia...we have welded ductwork.  Welded. And all round! Round! Three foot wide!  This ductwork, this ductwork....is all  <em>bullshit</em> , yes? Flimsy, yes?  <em>Bullshit</em> ."   <br/>

      I can't tell you how powerful one Balrog punch is.  I never liked him and I bet most people don't, but get your opponent in a corner (ie: against the screen) and he/she is  <em>done.</em>   We only picked Balrog because we ran out of other characters to beat one particularly stubborn upper-level character (on the PSII anniversary edition thing) and from there out it was smooth sailings.

      Yes. The joke is that I do not want to offer you an interesting and career-enhancing position doing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but I wish to lure you into a scenario where you will be taken to a local dungeon and/or sex club for an extended session of Cock and Ball Torture which is a most actual thing. I could likely hook this up very easily. We have some of the main sex-preverts in this town and this is a thing that makes it great. Folsom Street Fair, for example, is one of the third largest draws for the entire state and has flags on the lampposts all along the main street of town and it's a massive street fair for BDSM and leather culture. Specifically gay leather culture. Last year photos ran of a man getting anally fisted in the middle of the street (not on the street though, he was kneeling on a small platform) while a small crowd watched him or a man being fellated by another man in front of the Port-A-Potties (this struck me as an odd choice for this behavior) or places to get whipped or whip others. This is a major civic event. It is also derided, in some circles, for being too mainstream and touristy (I can agree with this, I did not go last year myself because I do not own fetish clothing and did not plan on taking part and did not want to be the sort of wander around watching others... that seems impolite and just plain incorrect) so there's another slightly more underground and more extreme Dore Alley Street Fair that occurs a bit before Folsom. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is why San Francisco is one of the greatest places to live in the world. Sadly there is only one major open to the general public hetero (and gay as well, but there are separate floors so everyone gets what they're looking for... along with a couples-only floor too) sex club and a lot more gay ones. There are more application-only straight clubs, but that's not quite the same thing. Good Vibrations, the notable sex shop, has ads on the subway from time to time. Discreet, true, but nevertheless ads to go buy sex toys aimed at the general market. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You want to get over your fear of juices? I can arrange some intense exposure therapy (in more ways than one) lickity-erm... well, lick.

      You asked why I hate you earlier and while I do not hate you I do have to say that it definitely feels like you're trying to antagonize me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically I was just trying to lure an unwitting SJE into a lengthy session of cock and ball torture and then when describing it the whole thing sort of got away from me into a more general discussion of how easy BDSM practices are to come by around here and how sexually permissive the city tends to be. I was rambling a bit, but you don't have to come after me like that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only other major places I have said are not amazing are Kansas and the South. Oh and the other day I said that most people probably don't think of Denver much aside from being stuck at their airport. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously man, get off my case. You think I hate you for some reason, but you're always trying to give me shit. Just lay off.

man, i remember when my roommate forced me to watch 16 candles with her. actually, she told me not to watch it because she and her friend were watching it and she knew i wouldn't like it and i'd just make fun of it the whole time and ruin it for them, but i insisted on watching it with them because i didn't have anything else to do that night and i promised i wouldn't make fun of it but i did and they ended up getting really mad at me after the movie ended but the point is that DAMN that movie was racist as all hell. they'd all sound a gong whenever long duk dong came into or left the room. i mean shit. i don't ever get offended but i got pretty close with that ignorant ass film.  <br/>

      I believe The Straight Dope addressed this issue and found that based on evidence black and white dudes are roughly the same size. I believe there was an explanation that perhaps it had something to do with skin color and typically being seen in a flaccid state - such as when showering in a communal manner - that these factors would contribute to a general impression of size that was not actually found when dealing with an engorged member that is actually measured.

      It makes sense to me.  I don't see what about it is inherently dumb.  It seems reasonable that some slaveowners picked their slaves partly due to the size of their genitalia; it is at least one factor that they might have looked at.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And artificial selection works just like natural, only much faster.  I fail to see what is so self-evidently dumb about this theory. <br/>

      Humans can't be artificially selected to alter the population in that short a period of time. We're talking about not much more than maybe six or eight generations here and that's being a tad generous. Even if there was a slight change it is too large a shift occurring over an impossibly short number of generations to show that kind of change. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As well there is no sensible reason to have made that change or the ability to restrict mating that severely to cause it to have such a pronounced effect. <br/>

      I don't know.  Five generations seems like it would have an effect.  I don't breed dogs or anything, but I'm sure by the fifth generation, the dogs would have bigger ones. <br/> 
It wouldn't have an effect on ALL the blacks in the world; just most of the ones in america.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But you're right, though.  I don't think slaveowners would not make too big a deal about down there.  And I don't think that those not chosen would have been significantly less likely to have bred. <br/>

      I don't know if it was listed here right now or not, but it fits into the stereotype of being a wild, animalistic "other" and I think it really comes most from our racist past, i.e. the black man wants to rape the white women with his massive animal penis. In time this has mutated to its current form. Also, Blacks on Blondes porn which carry the same racist undertones (and overtones) and are basically completely terrible. There's a lot of very racist porn out there about black men and it all conforms to this same basic stereotype even when it's being used in an emasculating context for humiliation fetishists.

      Dear sje46, not only would slaveovers NOT pick males with large genitalia, since they would not "fit" some females, Southerners often attacked black gentialia when lynchings occurred, often cutting said organs off and stuffing them in the dead black guy's mouth as he hung there.

      Not always. Some women prefer larger, some do not. It all depends on personal preference and your own size. I recall a Savage Love column a while back where a bunch of men with larger-than-average penises wrote in and complained about how hard it is that some women specifically do not want to have sex with them because they're afraid it will hurt, how they never get anal, how they can't go very deep, and how they rarely get deepthroated. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Porn and Craiglist's Casual Encounters sections are not the best sources in this case. People have different preferences. For every size queen out there (and I suspect a lot are just curious and expect bigger to be better) there are plenty of women who don't want to put up with some monster that they can't deal with and a sad, sad man lamenting his giant penis.

I think this is saying that wang size is related directly to escaping from lynch mobs. Though not carrying an entire damn butcher shop down there would certainly make it easier to run I do not think this is a strong enough correlation. <br/>

      I lived in Kansas during those issues both times. It was not at all fun. Not only am I a biologist, but my girlfriend who was also a biology major got a second degree in secondary education with the intention of teaching high school (student teaching taught her that this didn't agree with her) so it had plenty of impact on me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically I think the thing we eventually agreed on is that if they make you teach "alternative theories" or about "intelligent design" you start in with Greek, Norse, American Indian, etc. creation myths.

      Not only are there religions from the Fertile Crescent that believe that, there was a sect of the Cult of Jesus in the first or second century that believed that the things that came out of the human body were color-coded.  White was good, and black was bad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So they had orgies for Jesus. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When they were assembling the various texts that would become the bible, including the ones that help those in power stay in power, and rejecting those the empowered the hoi polloi, they chose to leave that one out. <br/>

      OK, I have done the minute or work required to find the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110104042210/https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/461/does-average-human-penis-length-vary-among-ethnic-groups">article in question</a> . The sample size is not quite as large as it ought to be, but it was found that the average length was found to be 0.3 inches longer when flaccid, but only 0.1 inches longer (and thicker) when erect. Again, low sample size, but this was Kinsey's data.

      Ummm, there is a problem here.  That article is terrible, because it doesn't even discuss what would be wrong with this study.  This one is better: <br/> 
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110104042210/https://www.mraverage.com/results.htm">https://www.mraverage.com/results.htm</a> <br/> 
You can see how inconclusive the results are.  Plus your source cites Kinsey.  KINSEY.  Do you really think Kinsey is that reliable of a source?  No, no bias there at all.  59 black men in the sample compared to 2,500 whites.  Hmm.  And respondents.  Of course dudes with bigger ones are more likely to respond.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The average length, they think (it is difficult to measure for many reasons,) is about 5.75 inches.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
This site doesn't have any information on blacks, but I'm just saying that your site doesn't seem very reliable.

      I and the article both noted the low sample size, twice, in fact. As for respondents since this was a comprehensive study it is unlikely that this was a significant source of bias. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your source, for comparison was sponsored by a condom company during Spring Break in Cancun, had a lower overall sample size, was for a specific datum (erectile size), has no information on ethnicity, and also features a picture of a scantily clad sexy nurse. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Straight Dope is not entirely scientific, but he cites a far more reliable source and generally attempts to do adequate and reasonably thorough research. I would cite that in this case it is a secondary source for Kinsey's data.

"dude, check out that chick at table 15a"  <br/>

      While you can get astounding cleavage when not constrained in a top or bra large breasts can look not so great. It's a tough problem and you generally have to accept trade-offs. Small, perky breasts generally look better when fully nude, but large breasts often accessorize better. I say just try to find what you love about what you've got.

      i love how you guys all assume i have no achewood-loving friends who went with me.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i have no achewood-loving friends who went with me. this dude named Colin took it for me. so, funny story. because he didn't bring a camera, i offered to take one for him, and after i did, he writes me his email address to send him the pic. a week goes by, i've forgetten to do it, then i check my facebook to see like 4 messages from the dude. he's all like "i didn't get the pic because i gave you the wrong email address, thank god i remembered your whole name from those post-its on our books, here's the actual email" "oh noes, wrong account. i sent that from my OTHER facebook account, this is the real one, lol, how's it going?" the funny part is coming.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
so about a week ago i started getting these text messages from someone in illinois that said things like "wouldn't morrissey be a good name for a horse?" and "have you seen this art exhibit *inserts picture*" and most recently "i really need a shopping partner this weekend". i am thinking, uh, some chick who i was friends with and had graduated? upon asking who it was, i got back "it's Colin! the guy you met at the achewood signing! i lifted your number off facebook, creepy huh!?" haha.. eh. kinda. not that he's not a cool dude. i'd hang out with him. actually, i think i'm already set up to at some indefinite time in the future.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
if you're reading this HI COLIN WELCOME TO ASSETBAR THESE ARE MY FRIENDS. <br/>

ASSETBAR, SAY HI TO COLIN! <br/>

      I don't see it as a situation where you are unable to please us.  I see it as a situation where this particular avicon  <em>displeases</em>  us. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your apparent plan to constantly change your picture to please us is doomed to failure for two reasons: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1)  When you make it seem so important to please us, you seem needy, and we view your efforts with disdain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2)  With as ornery a bunch of people as we are, pretty much every icon will have one or two people who dislike it.  You ain't never gonna make everbuddy happy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Find one you like, and stick with it.  Or keep changing frequently, and be prepared to endure periodic scorn.  It doesn't really matter to most of us. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But for Bog's sake, get rid of the creepy one you are using now!

      For once we agree, High Fidelity is the shit, so is Better off Dead. In fact, I recommend pretty much any John Cusack movie up to Grosse Point Blanke (he hadn't made Serendipity by that time, right?). Everything after that is less John Cusack and more a parody of John Cusack.

      So Grosse Point Blanke is in? Your phrasing makes this uncertain. Because that is a great film. Better Off Dead could have been better, but yeah, was good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd say that this is not a hard and fast rule though because Hot Pursuit was terrible, but he had a small role in Stand By Me and that was great. Also, Being John Malkovich was post-Blanke and very boss. Actually, High Fidelity is also after Blanke so this is a bit wrong. <br/> 
 <br/> 
America's Sweethearts came right after High Fidelity and I think that was the turning point. I haven't seen Max or The Ice Harvest though, but I've heard good things about both. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil could have been better, but I liked him in Con Air. It was a terrible movie, yes, but if you can accept it as a movie with a disturbingly good cast (Colm Meaney!) where things blow up it becomes a lot better. I'd rank it basically at the same level as Demolition Man as "bad, silly action movie that is actually kind of really fun if you don't take it seriously". <br/> 
 <br/> 
While on this subject we need some love for The Road to Wellville. I think I was the only person to really like that movie. I keep seeing the book for a good price at used bookstore and I ought to pick it up. It was really a great satire of the modern (or at least, early 90s) health craze and culture as contrasted with the Victorian era's sham health crazes. Also a great deal of sex. Once again it features Colm Meaney and is elevated for it.

      I will agree that there have been some post-Blanke movies that were decent (I keep forgetting he was in BJM) but for the most part he's just been playing a parody of his public persona. I mean War, INC was just a rehash of GPB but on a bigger scale.

      He's a mildly self-centered dude who works in a record shop, and can't keep it in his pants.  Sounds pretty masculine to me.  (Almost to the point of male stereotype.)  I thought the movie (and the book) were great, because he was an imperfect main character.   <br/> 
The movie for 'About a Boy' watered down the book quite a bit, but the main character in that book was also borderline-jagdouchenozzle.  (I recommend the book.)

      <em>About a Boy</em>  is very good, and the book and movie complement each other well, I think. There are some things I like better about the movie, and some things I like better about the book, so they sort of balance each other out. <br/>

      Working those kinds of record stores with those kind of people is a fucking nightmare, though.  I was working in a mom n' pop hipster college record store when High Fidelity came out, actually, and it made me realize how asinine the people I worked with were.   <br/>

There was the 35-going-on-16 year old asst. manager with his monthly DUIs and who only played The Smiths, Morrissey and the Pixies (I don't care how much you might like those bands, it gets fucking tiresome); there was the chubby white guy who only listened to backpacker hip hop and never stopped talking about "wax;" there was the weird old guy in the basement who did all the ordering and only listened to hard-to-find bluegrass records; and there was the predictable tall, skinny, indie rock kid who played the Shaggs on Sunday mornings to see how many complaints it would get.

      When I was a sophomore in high school, my best friend and I hated gym class really hard. So we used to make deals with the gym teacher. We would get changed and participate in exchange for cool things. Once, it was him pretending not to know that we stole a basketball at the end of class. Another time, it was giving us an A on a gymnastics routine that would have easily received a D or worse from any other gym teacher. But my FAVORITE reward was the week that we had to go outside to do the ropes course in the woods behind the school. (Yes, we had a complete ropes course in our woods.) In order to get to the course, we had to walk down this really big hill. In a moment of ultimate genius, I suggested to my friend that our reward for doing the ropes course should be the ability to leave class five minutes early to roll down the hill. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let's just say I finished that week with grass stains on my gym clothes.

I am unclear what this "ropes course" thing is, the mandatory health course I took mostly involved the "beep test" and badminton.  We played hella badminton.  Using cafeteria tables.

      Actually LHS is a very LOSER-ORIENTED high school. <br/>

This is true because they are a rival of my high school, which is awesome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(I actually don't have that much school pride). <br/> <br/> <br/> In my middle school (Chester), we had a huge moral on the wall of a New Hampshire landscape, and it was a climbing wall.  We would climb to the top of the gym and then jump for a ball.  It was scary.  Anoher time we were hooked up to a pulley and swung around the entire gym.  It was awesome.

      They tried to teach me to type, but I never learned. I learned to type by spending a ludicrous amount of time on the computer until my muscle memory taught me to type quickly and effectively. <br/>

I don't do it correctly though. I tend to type with the first two fingers on each hand primarily, but I have a pretty damn good speed and low error rate.

uh, Mario Party mini-games take like 10 seconds each. if by game, you mean a 50  hour RPG, then fine. but some of us can't spare days or weeks at a time on a proper "game" cuz we've got classes and assignments plus a 20 hour/week job.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
not that i play Mario Party either. the term "mini-game" has just sort of stuck with me. if i wanted a quick fix, i'd whip out soul calibur II or katamari damacy. i do wish i had more time to get into my yet unstarted copy of ICO sitting on the shelf, but sometimes i just think me and video games were not meant to be. maybe if i marry a rich doctor and become a stay at home wife, then i can play all the video games i want! and we'll probably have CABLE!!! ooooohhhh

      Actually I'm just terrible at finishing games. I don't just play one game at a time and do it intensely until I'm done with it, I play a bunch and go back and forth between them as I feel like playing each particular game. There are still NES and SNES games I haven't finished. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus no matter how much time it takes nobody says you have to play more than an hour or two at a time. I never got that whole thing about a game taking too long to finish.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I suspect a lot of this is just because I grew up in the days when you kept playing your 6 level game until you were amazingly good enough to even be able to consider beating it. You weren't expected to get to the end easily. So when I got frustrated with one game I'd switch to another one.

      playing several games at once is a really interesting idea, but i'm not sure if i'd be able to just switch modes like that. usually if i get stuck on a game, i will get up, make some food, come back, try again, fail again, fail again, keep failing. and then i give up and don't come back to it for like 2 months. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i think my problem is that i treat games like something that needs to be finished quickly, not something to be slowly savored. i mean even though i enjoyed God of War like nothing else (i had  <em>dreams</em>  about it), i still couldn't shake myself of this feeling that "damn i wish i were done already, i have other shit to do" whenever i played. i don't feel like this is a normal thing to think, and it probably degrades my enjoyment.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
as of other news, i should be getting Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem in the mail any day now. i'm totally tearing into that the minute my finals are over.

      I play it for a few days, but then... something happens and I typically lose interest. I drift into other games again. I pick it back up in a few months or longer and then maybe I play for a bit more. It's not even failure, I just burn out on most very quickly. Not even that really, I just, it not longer feels compelling after a short period of time. Very few games really hold me long enough to finish in one period. I think God of War 2 did, but yeah, I kinda wanted it to end. The original took about two dedicated periods to finish I think. Shadow of the Colossus took a lot longer because it was so easy to only do one or two and put it back for a while. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's all about the game I'm in the mood for and after a couple days of playing a game I'm usually sated and no longer in the mood for it. The majority of the games I own I'm halfway through or on the last level or such. I'll finish them in time.

      Hard to say. It has good ideas and a good plot, but the game itself isn't great and there are only four or so different enemies swapped around a bit (mainly depending on the choice you make at the beginning) to make them seem slightly different. Sanity effects are cool, but it's usually pretty easy to tell when they're happening and it's often fairly easy to avoid ever having your sanity sink that low. Late in the game you get the ability to heal yourself in all stats fairly easily and since magic resets by just walking around it takes away some of the challenge. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd say it's worth playing, but it could have been a lot better.

      Those effects didn't work on me at all. I know exactly what my system looks like and the sound and video switching is run entirely through my receiver. There were two that got to me. One was because I bought it at Gamestop used and I thought they might have just dicked me and sold me a (don't read further people, might be spoilers to cool things that will freak you out) demo copy by mistake and the other was when it crashed because I could almost see that happening, but it never throws up an error message like that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The others were clever, but well, if you know your home theater system they shouldn't work on you. If my TV volume went down I'd never even know. I have the TV speakers turned off.

      Dark Cloud 2 is a lot better than Dark Cloud. In every single possible way. There's no reason to even play Dark Cloud. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think, in some ways, I liked Rogue Galaxy a bit better. It's roughly the same game, but the dungeons aren't random and there's no Georama and the invention system is vastly reduced and not really at all the same (there are no pictures to take either). But the combat and basic gameplay nature and such, they're about the same. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Level 5 has really been doing well lately. White Knight Chronicles looks great. Of course, it looked even better two years ago.

      Mario Party has been all about the mini-games since it started in 98 on the N64.  The truly fun part of Mario Party has always been the mini-games, learning them and remembering them.  That's kind of the Deal with Mario Party.  Going around a board map and collecting mushrooms and stuff to get a star was not possible without the lucrative winnings of mini-games.

      Having started with the beginning of the franchise, I have to say that the game has become monotonous and repetitive.  It is like Monopoly.  It is fun, but halfway through the game you're frustrated with everyone and can't stand it anymore.  At least this was my take, but I have played 4 iterations of the game.

I was afraid to mention it though because I read all those books in seventh grade and thus do not know if they are actually good or if I just liked them at the time and would find them completely embarrassing now. I am pretty sure it is the latter case as far as the Shannarah series is concerned.

      It is kind of a mix of both. I read them in my sophmore year or so of high school which is how long I've been using this name. They are not... they do not hold up very well, but they still hold up better than a lot of things. It's mainly hard because the earlier books are worse than the later ones so it's too easy to drop out at the beginning. Belgariad and Polgara are both still pretty readable.

      I'm amazed that you were able to make deals with the gym teacher. I mean, most don't seem like the the type to care at all let alone make deals with students to get them to participate. Most would just give you a 0 for the day and be done with it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At my school there was a solid group of kids who couldn't be bothered to dress out and who would just hang around getting 0s all the time. I dressed out, but did the minimum necessary. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We too did not have a rope course or anything really. We had to do a bowling segment that meant a few fields trips. They made us learn to manually score bowling. I remember the best part was that I went to the only school in the district without a pool. Then I switched to a new school that had a pool and shortly after I left they built a pool at my old school. I narrowly avoided having to swim in front of my classmates. <br/>

As fate would have it, I was on the tail end of Surfer Rosa when I read your post and the subsequent one by the lovely fellow with the hat.  Vamos ends, I'm Amazed comes on and that wonderful intro plays in my ears for the hundredth time.  "My god!" I think, "Some divine being must have wrought this, I must comply."

      The opening of "I'm Amazed" starts with some studio banter of Kim Deal talking about her gym teacher:  <br/> 
"...girls and fucked em at school <br/> 
All I know is that there were rumours he was into field hockey players" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then the song starts up with the lyrics listed. It was pretty ham-fisted, but my intent was to relate it to  <strike>GoodTimeGirl</strike>  GoodwillGirl's own story of sexual escapades with a gym teacher by removing the parts that explain things and make it seem less dirty.

      Ray's bad dream is about to turn worse. He is onstage to sing Bolero on America's Next Superstar, but has forgotten the words and misplaced his guitar. His manager the robot tries to signal something to him, but he can't make it out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 The setting changes to a club full of expectant patrons. <br/> 
 He tries to improvise by doing a fandango on the table, but has no castanets to click, no taps on his feet, no background accompaniment to impress Cornelius' recently bereaved young widow.  <br/> 
Also, he is now only dimly aware she's not bereaved, nor is she a widow, and Cornelius is very much alive and rather put out.....but he cannot help any of his actions. <br/> 
 That is the whacky timeline that can ensue when good dreams go bad. He only had the best of intentions of comforting Polly in her time of loss. <br/>

      PEDANT ALERT!! <br/> 
 <br/> 
A  <em>bolero</em>  is a type of music that can be just instrumental, or a dance, or a song. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When most people hear the term "bolero," they think of the music from  <em>10</em> .  That piece of music is  <em>Ravel's Bolero</em> .  In that context, bolero refers to a piece of music that has an ever-increasing dynamic, that is, it constantly is getting louder. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do not know of a song that is just referred to just as "Bolero,"  but I am sure such a thing must exist.

      <em>Bolero</em>  refers to Ravel's  <em>Bolero</em> .  The piece is fairly ubiquitous.  It also led to Maurice Ravel nearly pimp-slapping the shit out of Arturo Toscanini, which would have been hilarious. <br/>

      Yes, I am intimately familiar with that particular piece of music.  It premiered in 1928.  It was written as the orchestration for a ballet.  It was originally titled  <em>Fandango</em> .  It is almost never produced as a ballet any more, but performed solely as an orchestral work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But it has no words.  It cannot be sung.  It therefore cannot be what  <strong>Scorpio_nadir</strong>  was referring to. <br/>

      I thought that the producers cooked it, but you had a rock or crystal or something and... smoke it? I do not know much about drugs.

      At the ghetto school in the local public school district, it is against policy to use red pens to correct tests and papers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Because the students or their family members may be Crips or Hoovers, and red is the color of the Bloods.  Having red on the papers would be seen as "set trippin'," and that could bring the gang wars right into the school.

      "However, in a National Post article from August 29, 2008, Michael Cera was quoted as saying he hasn't heard anything about an Arrested Development movie and is not interested in making one, remarking, "I don't think I would want to see a movie of the series if I was a fan, anyway." "And I don't really see a need for it if you can get the three seasons on DVD."[40]. A few weeks later at the Toronto Film festival he elaborated, "We%u2019re not in production and I haven%u2019t read a script. I know Jason (Bateman) wants to, and I don%u2019t know if Mitch (Hurwitz) wants to. But, I would only want to be a part of it if it was going to be good. Because, it's good to end on a high note, I think, and go out with a bang and leave the winning war. That%u2019s just my instinct. I don%u2019t think it would be worth doing unless it was going to live up to the expectation that might come with it."[41]"

      The last I heard was that it was on, but that was from Tambor. Then again apparently Hurwitz and Ron Howard have reached a deal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As far as not making one, uh, Michael Cera basically is playing the same role in everything else he does so it shouldn't be too much of a problem for him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kim Deal said the same sort of thing about a new Pixies album though. That if she was a fan she wouldn't want one. I don't get that sort of mentality. I mean, it's not like Billy Corgan dragging Jimmy Chamberlain along once again to do another half-baked project and just calling it Smashing Pumpkins because he wants the money or Axl Rose trying to claim that he alone (and 15 years) makes it Guns and Roses. This would be a full reunion. Actually, based on that particular article I found that I kind of don't like Kim Deal very much. Which is a shame because I used to really like her.

      I also call bullshit on "a fan wouldn't want one" because fans having been crying for a movie for the last 3 years, me being one of them.

      They aren't the same, but he's been typecast and keeps doing it again and again. It is not always bad. I saw Juno on opening weekend for select cities after the trailer I saw for it before Darjeeling Express looked really good so I was able to enjoy it a lot before the trend and then backlash started. <br/>

On a related subject that movie had terrible TV ads. They kept trying to push it as different types of films none of which it was. I swear I saw a ton of "heartwarming family story" ads. I liked it quite a lot, but an Oscar? So not justified.

OK, to get into that, I really don't like how they made the Reavers into some botched terraforming deal. That was awful. Rumors of men driven mad at the edge of space is awesome, but just some sort of radiation or chemical exposure? Very lame.

      I have an intimate knowledge and understanding of orbital mechanics.  And the ignoring of orbital mechanics in  <em>Serenity</em>  made my suspension of disbelief way more difficult than I wanted it to be. <br/>

      Orbital mechanics says:  If you don't want to fly straight through the middle of the enemy camp,  <em><strong>JUST FLY AROUND IT FOR FUCK'S SAKE!!!</strong></em> <br/>

The whole camouflage  <em>Serenity</em>  and then fly right through the middle of the Reavers was utter crap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But then it was necessary for the fucking  <em>plot</em> , so the Reavers could distract the Alliance, and so Wash could die, and so there could be the hook up between Simon and Kaylee, and so River could have her battle scene. <br/>

      Why do you think it would suck?  If all the original writers and director-types are working on it, hopefully, it'll have the same feel and tone as the series, which as far as I can tell, never deviated from the pilot to the last episode (except for the whole Rita arc, which was a lot sillier than the rest of the show, but in a good way).  Also, the show left us with a cliff hanger, and we need to find out how it all really ends.  Although it might be weird to watch a 2 hour story start and end, when really the entire series was one big story.

      I disliked the Rita arc and felt that it was generally a bad move for the show and conspicuously weaker than the earlier seasons. The ending though, they tried to wrap it up. George Sr. was totally off the hook and Michael and George Michael finally leave the family. It felt a bit too silly and a little off to me, but I saw what they were trying to do. They even went back to another boat party in order to try and return it to the beginning.

      I hear this from people but I always liked the Rita arc.  The one arc I never liked was the  Maggie Lizer story.  I mean, every episode has like 20 memorable quotes, but the overall story was just not for me.

      The asshole I pirated AD from labelled the last season wrong, so I watched them heck of out of order.  Once I figured out what was going on it made a lot more sense. <br/> <br/> <br/> I'm not sure how much of a running joke you can fit into a 2 hour slot.

      well, one of the good things about hulu is that it is legit. Everything on there by whoever owns it. Also, it has the upside of having hi-def options, there are some commercials, but I don't mind them. Bad thing is that is U.S.A. only. <br/>

      This just reminded me of a linguistics paper I read recently where it was assumed that these two sentences have a different meaning: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. Someone considers every Congressman a fool. <br/> 
2. Someone considers every Congressman to be a fool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
According to the guy, #1 means that there is a given person who considers every Congressman a fool, while #2 means that for every Congressman, there is someone (not necessarily the same person) who considers them a fool. This is bugging the hell out of me because I cannot see how you would get the second reading.

There is a difference between a number and a numeral.  It's the same difference as between a word and a letter. <br/>

      I will also be a pedant.  I was incorrect to say number there, but given the lexical context of 0x (implies hexidecimal), A-F are not alphanumerical, but strictly numerical.  The symbol 'A' is merely an abstract symbol until the context of hexidecimal is set to it, which transforms the whole lexeme into a numerical token.

      I doubt you hate him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
See hate and love are like a road, a one lane highway with cars coming this way and that.  Now if you stand in the middle they will pass you and you will live (unless they hit you i guess) but if you stand in one of the lanes (love and hate) you will be struck and you will die.  If you are not killed in the initial impact I will come over and hit you in the neck with a shovel until your head has serperated from your body. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also if you try to run to either side and out of the middle be careful, because love and hate might hit you before you can make it to the sidewalk.  Also I am on of the sides and I have a gun and I am going to shoot you if I see you.  She was a nice girl and you got her with child and you wont assume responsiblity, she was my sister and I cannot forgive this.

      It says above her comment that she said it an hour before you did. At least, to me it does. It's also the problem that Assetbar puts newer comments above older ones most of the time in the threading when they're both replying to the same thing. It is astoundingly bad for a message system.

      It was not especially important for Magnum so, no, I don't think so. As long as you can manage to cut a head almost, but not all the way off it would seem that, at least in this day and age, you'd be as good a choice as any. Besides, it is you whom I have wronged.

      yea, sje, i totally agree. tortilla's and other soft mexican flatbreads have this  <em>stench</em>  to them, like they were stored in a room with rotting rats for about one week before the undiscerning employees of taco bell wrapped you up a nice soft burrito with it. this is also what i imagine the inside of women's folds to smell like. or women's armpits. i have a serious issue with smells. sometimes i catch myself in the middle of the day thinking up some smells that i am glad to not be smelling at the moment and that i am largely terrified of on the whole.

      I have long been aware that there are certain things I cannot taste, things that other people can normally taste.  But your comment that tortillas have an overwhelming taste leads me to believe that you are at the other end of the spectrum.  That you taste things other people can't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Because to me, the taste of the tortilla is the least obtrusive aspect of any tortilla-based food.

      I know you weren't trying to be offensive.   <br/> 
I'm not really sure if I am that odd though.  I am not, for example, that picky an eater.  But the thing is that the things I don't like (soda, bread, tortillas, lasagna) tend to be the things that a lot of people love.  Also, tatts, of course, and I don't drink or swear. <br/> 
I mean we are all eccentric in our own ways, but I don't think I am in a noticable way.  I am not riding on a unicycle in a terribly made big bird costume like a certain person I know.

      "Serious issues" means there are lots of things about your personality that make social interactions problematic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You do things or say things or think things, and other people misinterpret what your intentions are.  And when people misinterpret, they tend to goes with the least generous interpretation, then punish you for their failure to understand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's what I meant by serious issues.  Being a cutter or drug-dependent or something like that is more than an "issue." <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I believed something like that were going on, I would just avoid interacting with you.  I recognize my limits, and dealing with such things is outside my capabilities.

      You sound a lot like me at that same age. Well maybe not exactly the same age, more like 18 or so for me, but definitely early in my freshman year. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I never went on a date because I never asked anyone out. Ever. Even now I basically got around ever having to ask my girlfriend out before it was very obvious that she was into me (i.e. tongue in mouth). <br/> 
I don't think I even had friends in high school. Or middle school. Oddly I'm better friends after high school with a lot of people I knew in high school, but was not actually really friends with. They had their circle and I knew them, but I was not a part of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't respond in the same ways, but I have a lot of the same cares. I think most people do as well. <br/>

OK, the part about not looking people in the eyes is a bit weird, and never looking in the mirror, but I think maybe you're just taking it a bit too far or being dramatic. Still, those cares? They're normal. Just work on how you deal with them.

      The first time I remember making eye contact was in the 7th grade and it hurt like heck (it still does, but not as bad). <br/> 
I look in the mirror when I'm shaving and stuff, but I tend not to look at my own reflection when passing a window. <br/> 
I didn't become comfortable saying I had friends until pretty much senior year of high school.   <br/>

      I had a different experience with you, Sje. I kind of hated you at first. I took kind of a Summer vacation from assetbar and when I returned you were just  <em>everywhere</em>  and I was, like, "Who's this little spazz bouncing off the walls every god damned place I look?" Then I came to realize that there was more to you than "I'm five!" and I started to feel kinda good about you.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, yeah - you still throw me for a loop every couple of days. Abortion conversations, black dick conversations....I mean, conversations about these things is fine, but your part in them is sometimes kinda really strange as hell. I don't want to elaborate on that. It's OK. It's interesting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just as a side note, I did a little experiment the other day. I hit "ignore" on you and theguitarhero for a day. The page loaded so quickly I didn't even know what to do with myself. I just wanted to see what it looked like. I then switched it back, obviously. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end, I like you. You definitely have strange opinions about tortillas and sex juices, but I think you're a good guy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you were wondering....

      Thank you . .. I guess? <br/> 
I guess I am a spazz.  I spent a lot of time worrying about whether I would be percieved a lot and if thus people would hate me, and I guess I was right. <br/> 
=/ <br/> 
I'm glad I stopped that "I'm five!" act a while ago though.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I . .. I still kinda want to know how my part in these conversations are strange.  I know you don't want to elaborate but I am actually very intrigued by this.  It is important to me how others perceive me.  Is it bad?  I don't understand.  I try to be logical, you know.  Maybe how I go about doing logic isn't how other people do it. <br/> 
I know I post way too much, and I'm sorry.  That's what happens when you have no hobbies.  I'm a little addicted to the internet.   <br/> 
But yeah.  Thanks for being honest :)

      I don't want to elaborate because I'm afraid I would come off as condescending. It's a very difficult thing to avoid for someone 30 or older discussing real-life issues with someone 20 or under. See? Two sentences in and I already sound like an asshole. I'm sure there are ways to avoid it, but I'm not a great communicator. <br/>

      I agree. When I first noticed assetbar a large majority of the comments would be about the strip but whenever I check lately its mostly banter among the community. It seems to me recent strips/arcs have lost much of the edge and surrealism. Its gone from dudes going to hell and back and bizarre helicopter rides to weddings and girlfriends. It can't be easy coming up with such memorable plotlines week after week though.

      Agreed as well. I came in around the start of the Roast Beef Wedding arc (although my first strip was the Prostitute...whatever, thing) but I had read through the archive and you could kind of tell there was a change in the dynamic. It was so thick you could taste it.

(Vlad puts on "Cream City" by Aalon Butler and settles on the can. As the music begins, Vlad is shown for several panels struggling physically against the forces within himself. We are never struck by the idea that as a robot Vlad cannot go to the bathroom, and anybody who brings this up on the comments for the strip is directed to that one where Vlad gets so horny he eats the soap, and somebody postulates that Vlad does this on a regular basis as part of some cleaning procedure.)

      Something similar to this happened to me at work just last week. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A little girl bought a white stuffed owl, and I asked her if she was going to name it Hedwig. She said no, and she asked me what Hedwig was. I told her that it was Harry Potter's owl, and her mother said, "Oh no, we don't allow things like magic in our house."

      She is AND she's one of the few Disney Channel starlets with an actually good singing voice. Ashley Tisdale (my other D.C. crush)'s voice is laughable at best, and Vannesa Hudgens is just weird and kinda trashy. <br/>

On a semi-related note, I had to take my girlfriend to see High School Musical 3 when it came out. She's in college, by the way, and actually a year OLDER than me.

      I'm amazed that Disney Channel turned itself into something people actually watch as opposed to "that crap channel you get for free with HBO packages because nobody actually wants it". <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's focus on tween crap though. I wish it was gone again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, it showed Maniac Mansion in the late 80s. I never understood how this connected to the games though. Wasn't it Canadian? Is that the source of the problem?

      It was more of a Kids in the Hall kind of thing, but later. I'd say it was one of the lasp gasps of MTV having anything worth watching, but definitely before they moved away from not just music, but even away from original programming and into reality shows all the damn time. <br/>

It is also, because of the lack of DVDs and such, perhaps a bit of a generational/cultural signifier now.

      The  <em>Deadwood</em>  movie(s) never got past the rumor stage.  I guess there are people who still want to see it, but I don't think anyone with any pull is trying to get it done. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The thing about  <em>Deadwood</em>  though, is the fact that there never was a ratings/viewers issue with that show.  The mucky-mucks at HBO assigned David Milch to make another show ( <em>John From Cincinnati</em>  fer Crissakes!) and told him to only make half a season of  <em>Deadwood</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Milch threw a snit, and told HBO it would be a whole season of  <em>Deadwood</em>  or nothing.  The HBO dickheads said, "OK, nothing it is!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
When it was pointed out to the parties involved that there were several loose ends in the plot, someone said, "We could make a movie and tie up the loose ends!"  The someone else pointed out that all the loose ends could not be tied up in a single movie, someone else said, "OK, we'll make two or three movies!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
It never really got past that point.  And it has been so long now that chances of it happening are slim and none. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't get me wrong, I loved that show, and I am deeply disappointed that it just got chopped off like that.  But I don't entertain any hope or expectation that there will be any more of it produced, as a TV program or as a movie.

      Just how 70 year olds are not attracted to other 70 olds, but rather 20 year olds, I am attracted to this girl.  Is that wrong? <br/> 
Actually, she does look a little too young in this picture.  I think the age a girl looks cutest is 15.  It is true.  But this girl is cute, but no in a I want to do things with her kind of way.  Maybe in a few years.

      I was kidding, quite clearly, but I share this sentiment.  Babies are basically lower than dogs on the usefulness scale and they are poop.  I can't like someone as a person until like age 10 and that's ONLY if they're a relative.  Other people have to be older than, say, 16.

You just need to discipline your child, and he will develop far more quickly.  Do not feed him until he speaks his first word.  Tape his butt shut when he is not in the bathroom.  Find out what he's allergic to and spread it on the floor so he has to walk to avoid getting it on his hands.

      I need to confirm something. Northern England is roughly, culturally, considered the same as the Southern United States, yes? I am not speaking in specifics, but in a general means of stereotyping people for their thick, terrible accents and low, country ways as they are rural hicks without culture or learning. Perhaps the religious and racist angles in the US make it less appropriate.

      Even I am, at times, uncertain how much I was joking. I mean, that was certainly my intent, but at the same there is a certain truth in it. <br/>

I obviously need to work on my Assetbar style. There is so much more to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On another note I have often thought of how much it must suck to be an amazing artist in some field or another. You would never be able to experience your own works. I mean, isn't it better to be able to watch Kubrick's films than to have been Kubrick and be unable to appreciate them. In fact, being unable to appreciate them because they are never able to live up to what you wish them to be. Not to mention with film, as with most other artistic mediums, you've been watching and re-watching it so many times that most directors have often commented that they're sick of seeing the damn thing and never watch it again.

      The funny part is I'm not lieing, but my director can't get the site running and I only have a JO video right now.  Another funny part is that I'm laughing the whole time. <br/>

My roomate taped me, I would look over and see him standing there and I'd just laugh. <br/>

      And yet you never heard anything about people not letting their kids see the narnia films. All it would take would be a couple of "son of adam"'s and they'd be onboard. Nothing works as well as name dropping in attracting an audience, just look at contemporary urban music.

      Same goes for Lord of The Rings, however I find the Christian subtext in it as way more obscure, unlike the subtext in Narnia.  <br/>

I still like Narnia better, but only the books. It was the first series of books my dad read to me before bed.

I think the crazy part is that these people only would have a point if there were people out there doing all sorts of magic all the damn time. Or is it just supposedly wrong to  <em>want</em>  magical powers? Is that something only your god is allowed to do? I just don't get it.

      I may have issues with the dialogue in this strip, but I am most certainly not jumping on the "Onstad-is-busy-clipping-his-baby's-toenails-and-traveling-to-write-Achewood-properly Bandwagon." On the whole the strips have been solid, the stripper may be a female character with a bit of depth (and therefore threatening to the all-male hipster audience), and Little Nephew is dead (just think about it because it is funny). This particular one is a bit of a stinker but there is no consensus that things are going south.

      What, we're a bunch of sexists?  And hipsters?  For thinking the writing is bad?  What?  Okay, ignoring that, it has been blatantly, painfully obvious for some time that the quality of writing in Achewood has gone downhill (I'd pinpoint the end of the GOF as the beginning).  And I'm not going to offer the "Onstad-don't-owe-you-nothin'-so-shut-up" excuse or the "it's-still-better-than-90%-of-the-rest" excuse.  To mount such arguments is an insult to the strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Blaming Onstad is immaterial.  Comedy careers are short and sweet.  Achewood was as funny as a thing can be for as long as a thing can be funny.  It's "golden age" lasted as long as the Simpson's, for Christ sake.  What can you expect?    <br/>

      I don't even understand how a man can say that mannerism is inferior to baroque, I mean baroque was pretty boring but with mannerism you get some pretty subtly freaky images which you don't know quite what's wrong but then you start having nightmares about people whose fingers are longer than their faces comin' to get ya. <br/>

Baryoque is basically just cropping and in-the momentness.  Better than this Renaissance nonsense, however.

      Just the whole hype about the Renaissance being a rebirth of culture, basically, kinda annoys me.  I mean, that isn't what the "rebirth" is referring to . . .it refers to the rebirth of classical culture.  But Greek and Roman art is kinda boring to me too.  What I'm saying is that a lot of REnaissance art is kinda boring and dare I say over-rated?  Overrated in the sense that so many lay-people like it, but do not really understand it though.   <br/>

Basically the whole order and vertical and horizontalness and pictures of Jesus .. . they bore me.

      It really depends on context.  How many Humanities classes have you taken?  Were your instructors any good?  This will have an enormous impact on the way you view the Renaissance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My Humanities professor was  <em>awesome</em> .  She made it clear how the it was a rebirth of culture after the Dark Ages killed it, and the Middle ages did little (other than cathedrals) besides leaving it laying there dead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Suddenly there is a new appreciation for the real world, and how art reflects the real world.  People are actually thinking about things again, in a way that was along the road to the Enlightenment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But you can't look at Renaissance art and judge it as boring without realizing how it relates to what had come immediately before. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is a lot like someone in the 21st century looking at the Beatles in the context of the present and thinking, "They are not so impressive."  You have to take into account how the Beatles relate to what had come immediately before.  That adds many layers of depth to what they accomplished. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Renaissance is the same way. <br/>

I wasn't really calling you a hipster, sje.  (On a side note, I feel I'm actually starting to outgrow the whole hipster-bashing thing.  It doesn't weigh on my emotions like it used to.  I can even read pitchfork without getting all angry at it!  Anyone else feel that way?  Is it Barack Obama?  Are we changing?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for the Renaissance, I kind of feel you... I always thought the Sistine Chapel ceiling was a little dull (dig the Last Judgment, though... and his sculptures, of course).  Never much liked the Last Supper.  But there's not getting around the fact that a lot of dope ass shit (to use the scholarly term) got dropped on canvases during that period.  No getting around it.

      I am that guy in the 21st century as regards the Beatles. I don't see why you'd hate Pitchfork since it is a very Pitchfork/hipster thing to harp on how modern music just can never compare to The Beatles or Dylan but in the meantime here are some snobby reviews of people who try. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think you need to dig very far to find a reason for hating Pitchfork. For example, here is the first sentence of a Pretty Girls Make Graves review: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Angular, studio-polished emo-math-punk is the stuff of slightly wizened-up ex-mallcore kids, not premeds.</em></div> <br/>

      "Oh yes folks and it looks like Pitchfork is... <strong>OWNED</strong>  by newcomer achilleselbow! What a game folks, what a game." <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is damn near impossible for any music to find that perfect balance of accessibility, inaccessibility to outsiders, coolness, and rejection of coolness that Pitchfork seems to demand that everyone has. The only ratings that music should ever have are: "I like this," "I don't like this," "No one should ever like this."

      achilleselbow, are you... insulting me?  I can't really tell.  But if you're insulting the Beatles, I'm going to have to send the police to your house TO KILL YOU because it is ILLEGAL to not like the Beatles ABOVE ALL OTHER BANDS!  This is true because John Lennon was all about fascism and himself being the best ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for your pitchfork quote, that may be the douchiest thing I have ever read, and yet... well... from my experience, angular, studio-polished emo-math-punk kind of IS the stuff of slightly wizened-up ex-mallcore kids.  Like, I actually find that to be a pretty accurate assessment.  But it's funny, I had a premed friend in college who was all about that emo-math-punk stuff.  So fuck 'em. <br/>

Look, I still get annoyed at pitchfork... but it just doesn't fill me with rage like it used to.  I think it's that I'm out of school, no longer surrounded by those hipster people all the damn fucking time.  Maybe absence makes the heart grow fonder.

      Oh, it's not a matter of whether the Pitchfork quote is accurate. It actually describes me quite well. What's ridiculous is the implication that even  <em>having listened to</em>  "unhip" music  <em>in the past</em>  means you are somehow tainted for life and anything you like afterwards is not worth taking seriously. I'm sorry that my parents weren't hippies or upper-middle class intellectuals with Bob Dylan or jazz records for me to go through. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will gladly admit that I still listen to Darkest Hour and Poison the Well, have much more embarrassing stuff on my ipod, and if a Killswitch Engage song comes on I might find it kind of catchy and bob my head along to it instead of sneering and turning it off. Firstly, it was a phase that was integral on the path of getting me to expand my tastes beyond pure metal and eventually appreciate indie, etc. Secondly, I think metalcore gets an undeservedly bad rap. Sure it's easy to make fun of Atreyu or Avenged Sevenfold and their retarded fans. But then again there are bands like Between the Buried and Me, which are critically acclaimed everywhere BUT Pitchfork (where they seem to be ignored out of principle). Then there are bands like Undying, Day of Suffering, Morning Again, etc., who were making brutal, heartfelt, socio-politically charged music about technology, veganism, and spirituality before "metalcore" was even coined as a term. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think admitting these things categorically disqualifies me from being a hipster. But "hipster" is a relative measurement, and to my preppy friends, the fact that I wear somewhat tight jeans, have longer hair, and listen to music that from their standpoint is out of the mainstream, are enough to qualify me as a hipster. I am sure that you and many other posters here would qualify similarly. Then again, even the most sterotypical hipsters I see (ride shitty bikes, roll own cigarettes, are vegan, etc) all without fail deny that they are hipsters, seizing on some specious individual detail that they claim differentiates them. So it's all a matter of perspective.

      Well that's what I'm saying. The point is that I'm not actively trying to escape being a hipster. In fact, when I initially moved here much of my time was spent trying to mingle with the hipsters and then realizing that I didn't have as much in common with them as I thought and thus couldn't fit in. So I think what differentiates me from hipsters is that if you ask me whether I am a hipster, I will say that I don't think I'm cool enough to be, rather than sneeringly dismissing the notion as if I am above it.

      The only Between the Buried and Me song I have heard is "Prequel to the Sequel" and I did not care for it. Screamy vocals are an instant fail for me. Bring back metal with soaring vocals  <em>a la</em>  Halford, Dickinson, or Dio. Even Metallica/Megadeth style growly vocals do a good job.

      That is an unfortunate attitude, because you are basically missing out on all the fine things that came out of Norway and Sweden in the early 90's. There is a certain effect that screaming vocals achieve in the likes of early Dark Tranquillity or In Flames that just would not be the same with normal singing. It's a hard barrier for people to get past, but once you do, there's a whole world there.

      Well, regardless, I think you should at least move beyond classic rock/classic metal and explore power metal and epic/symphonic metal. I mean you're obviously into fantasy and RPG's and such, so stuff like  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110104042210/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3salqbozGIU">Helloween</a> ,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110104042210/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDpAkE6wR3A">Blind Guardian</a> , and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110104042210/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIKWYy_m1Dk">Rhapsody</a>  should be right up your alley.

      I find that if you go through the records for bands they will consistently rate newer releases lower as if they are consciously making the decision to say in the future that they liked their early stuff best. This is not true if it is Radiohead or someone else they have canonized. <br/>

      A hipster thinks Kerouac is Jesus, PBR is coolness in a can, jeans must be tight, apathy should wear a smile, bikes with one gear are better than cars, the city is heaven on earth, every article of clothing should be slightly ironic, everything must be said obtusely, commercialism is Satan, but buying shitloads of used stuff is kosher, photos should be taken on cameras that are at least twenty years old and imported onto macbooks, old record players and consoles should be hooked up to cheap sony home stereos, the concept of nature is cool but its prictice is not, and that hipsters suck and they are not a hipster.

      Some examples pulled straight off Facebook: <br/> 
 <br/> 
English: <br/> 
"Hey bud,it's been a while. You still making music?" <br/> 
Hipster: <br/> 
"lord of the damned how i miss you so. whats new. is music?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
English: <br/> 
"Why have you been acting so self-consciously weird lately?" <br/> 
Hipster: <br/> 
"Why do you do what you do?" <br/> 
(and the response) <br/> 
English: <br/> 
"I dunno. I guess I have been kind of an ass lately." <br/> 
Hipster: <br/> 
"I should probably just go to purgatory right now and end this terrible fetusness." <br/> 
 <br/> 
English: <br/> 
"You never came back from your car yesterday. What the fuck?" <br/> 
Hipster: <br/> 
"Oh bird, you flew away on me yesterday and did not fly back." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I could keep going and I had some better examples back in Myspace days. But this is the general sentiment I was trying to capture. Never say anything clearly or directly, and never be confrontational. Every sentence must be imagined as being delivered by someone with an ironic sort of smirk.

      I don't think so. Partly it requires you to keep up on the trends even as you want to claim to be above them. If you were really above them you'd be ignoring them, not conspicuously avoiding something because it's now popular or claiming that your enjoyment of it is only "ironic". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't enjoy "Any Way You Want It" ironically. I enjoy it because whenever it is on no matter what else is happening you are partying. It is impossible to not be partying when that song is in earshot. That is what it means.

      I would say that as I left High School land for College, I was on the path to being an aspiring hipster and had many hipster friends. College done smacked some sense into me. Plus PBR makes me want to vomit, my large legs make tight jeans impossible, and I un-ironically like certain non-trendy musics, movies, and video games.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember asking a hipster buddy if he wanted to come over and play some vidya games, and he was all like "Hells yes! We playin' Genesis or Super Nintendo?" At the mention of Halo, he muttered some excuse and slipped away.

      This is because Halo is just a terrible game. You don't have to like Super Nintendo exclusively or in some sort of ironic or retro manner, but simply because it was the greatest console produced. It was the last, most advanced console to still be used primarily for 2D games before things went into unnecessary 3D just for the sake of doing it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still play a lot of current generation games, but console First-Person Shooters? Feh and Pshaw! That is best confined to the computer alone where you can actually control them properly and play generally better titles (until the current era where they seem to be getting better). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it takes special attention to trends to want to ride a fixie (which, aside from being only single-speed, typically also lack brakes) in a city this hilly. Of course, the whole fixie thing is just an amalgam of wanting to emulate bike messengers combined with a desire for overpriced retro-cool. I almost never see them being ridden anywhere. I think you just have it as an accessory to park outside trendy places.

      Because, as I have read, bike messengers typically use them because they're making a lot of short trips in generally flat business districts constantly getting on and off. Bike messengers are cool to the hipster crowd so they have co-opted many of their customs even when doing so is entirely stupid. They also like how many of the popular fixies or coaster bikes have a retro look to them as well as a thrift store look that is so in still. They claim they like how it looks "clean" without the gears and brakes. I claim that if you are in one of the hilliest damn cities in the nation and you are riding a bike that cannot be shifted down to go up the hill or brake when you're coming back down you're a complete idiot.

      Apparently they're also less prone to breaking down, or chain falling off, etc. though hipsters seem like the kind of people who would still replace the chain every year or so.  I'm happy with my "approximately 10 speed" bike (of 24 options, 9 or 10 are useful to me) but putting the chain back in isn't a whole lot of fun, especially when it falls off the rear gears.

      I am only sort of a hipster but I love riding fixed gear (in not-too-hilly St. Louis, with at least a front brake, kind of pussy gear ratio, lights at night, and even sometimes a HELMET) for the following reasons: <br/> 
-less maintenence <br/> 
-better feel for the road in rain sleet or snow (if you are spinning out you are definitely gonna feel it) <br/> 
-better control of speed for convenience at intersections (even if you haven't mastered your track stand you can slow down to a near-stop and wait for a hole so you don't have to get out of your clips/cages) <br/> 
-hot anarchist chicks will like you more <br/> 
-lighter weight <br/> 
-more power through your entire stroke <br/> 
-cheaper to build <br/> 
-and finally, yes, a cool factor (I want to be cool, I admit it, cool dudes have more friends and ladies like them, what is so bad about trying to be cool?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't let the style-fixie poseurs in every city fool you about the entire idea of fixed-gear biking.  I commute 7 miles a day each way, make left turns at major intersections, respect cars and pedestrians, and often find myself passing geared-out be-spandexed roadbikers on uphills, downhills, or no-hills.

      Genesis? Super Nintendo? Pshhh, I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. Everyone knows that real hipsters refuse to play anything above 8-bit games because that was the real "Golden Era". Which is kind of funny, seeing how most of them were born around the same time as me and thus would have spent most of their formative years in the 16-bit era. Even their NOSTALGIA is fucking fake. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I really hate is that arcades have declined nowadays compared to consoles, to where that all that's left is either the new fixtures that require a huge setup and cannot be easily ported (basically just racing games and that boxing thing), or ironic retro-nostalgic places that don't have anything newer than Pac-Man. Am I the only one who feels nostalgia for 90's games where you walk down the street beating the shit out of everyone (Final Fight, X-Men, The Simpsons)? Do we have to wait a few more years until they're sufficiently old enough to be 'retro'?

      I was at the terrible place at Metreon the other day and while it was an awful arcade they had Tekken, uh... 3? Something. I never got into Tekken. They also had two or three Marvel Vs. Capcom II machines. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the same time they had a room next door that was nothing but claw machines. NOTHING ELSE. Just white walls and rows and rows of an empty room and claw machines. It was horrifying. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personally I was born at such a time that I got a NES Deluxe Set (with R.O.B.) in 1986 for my birthday. I have real nostalgia for it. I remember when it was just basically launch titles. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You'd think that finding a decent arcade in what is the center of America's technology industry and a major geek cultural center wouldn't be this hard, but it's nearly impossible. I also only know of one damn gaming shop to buy role-playing supplies and such in that's in the city. There are more over in Berkeley, but still. I don't even know a single independent video game store here.

      it's the hipsters who have smeared post-modernism with their flimsy and irresponsible application of it. it is deep and complicated shit (ever tried reading Deleuze?) which they have reduced to a mere simulacrum, nay, not even, a  <em>pastiche</em> . perhaps they would deny their trying to achieve a post-modern aesthetic at all, for what is the post-modern subject but one de-centered, but that does not mean we don't have to take responsibility for our actions, and life is not some carefree joyride where you can just work at fucking whole foods and attend loft parties and just have a gay old time, because that's not what post-structuralism is about and that's not what Nietzsche is about, and i bet they don't ever think about their own temporality or the fact that they are huge fucking conformists who support a cause that is merely aesthetic and maybe they do and maybe they don't care and i HATE that they don't care because life is about taking responsibility for your potentialities and your place in the historicity of the world and recognizing which possibilities are yours to fulfill and which aren't and then fulfilling them because every day you are aware that you are closer to death. to live ironically is to deny responsibility for the fact that we can all contribute something great, and perhaps to do so involves applying yourself to one thing with dedication and resoluteness and not 'living it up' every day immersed in some opiate of what they call "post-modernism". perhaps this disregard for responsibility is only so stark and offensive to me in the case of hipsters because unlike farmboys or inner city kids, they have had all the financial and education privilages they could want and yet they use it to no good purpose at all. pleasure in the moment is King and all intellectual or aesthetic endeavors are only a means to the ends and not the ends themselves. so they use these things to tint their ironic sunglasses a pleasing shade so that the world looks artistic and meaningful and carefree, all primed for their consumption. and the worst part about it is they do it under the guise of true intellectualism, that is, of doing something that actually matters, of saying something that's actually meaningful. they have taken the hammer with which real intellectuals reason, and they have used it instead to bugger their own asses. the mind is a terrible resource to waste. but it is theirs to do with it what they like, and masturbation seems like a popular choice. just don't spew at me some coke-induced polico-ethical manifesto and imagine that i'll actually think you're an interesting or worthwhile human being. you fucking hipster asshole.

I am still taking my only art history course, but that doesn't change the fact that a lot of renaissance paintings are boring.  I admit that it begins at the renaissance.  But my teacher is pretty good, it seems.   <br/> 
Anyway I was basically under the impression that the reniassance didn't revive culture itself, but rather only the culture of the Romans/Greeks. But, yeah.  The Mona Lisa is boring to me, but it is still a good painting, as are a lot of paintings.  I like some of renaissance paintings, but they are also very often very boring.  Perhaps I need more art appreciation classes. <br/>

      The great thing that came out of the Renaissance was the resurgence not of classical ideas, but of classical analysis.  The Neo-Platonics pushed people to start examining the nature of the world around them again.  Some did so with art, some with science, and some with philosophy.  They didn't take all that much of the old classical culture, but they did take the core revolutionary ideas of the golden ages and put them back into practice.  That is why Europeans were able to abuse the rest of the world over the next few hundred years, despite shitting in ditches

      The idea that da Vinci was a homosexual has  <em>absolutely utterly and completely <strong>nothing</strong> to do with the da Vinci Code.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Da Vinci hid a lot of stuff in his art works and his inventions, this is true.  But he hid it from people he was afraid would steal it, and from the Church. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Symbolism in his works, both hidden and overt,  was S.O.P.  He did it because all the cool artists were doing it.  He did it because he could get away with it.  He did it for fun. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But it has nothing to do with Dan Brown's bullshit novel, or the bullshit movie that was made from it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The homosexual thing has lots of circumstantial evidence.  But of course he wasn't flaming.  Not if he wanted to stay out of jail. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't have an opinion either way.  Even if I somehow knew, it wouldn't matter to me.  I don't feel any strong desire for him to be homo or hetero.  It won't change my appreciation of his work.

      Oh I wasn't saying he didn't have symbolism.  I was saying that I don't think the symbolism they claim in the Da Vinci code is the symbolism he intended.

      What about the simpler "don't read The Da Vinci Code"? <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you want to explore the same basic idea of someone who rips off  <em>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</em>  and makes it into a work of fiction you should investigate the comic  <em>Rex Mundi</em> . It takes place in an alternate history France in the build-up to an alternate World War II with magic and basically the same whole Merovingian/Priory of Sion/%u201CEt in Arcadia ego%u201D deal.

      From my understanding the last time I looked into it he was basically a self-proclaimed rabbi who was getting the local Jewish population worked up with some fairly typical nationalistic/ethnocentric sort of rhetoric along with some fairly typical "be nice to people" religious statements. When he came into Jerusalem over Passover however the Romans, who typically had trouble keeping the Jewish population under control at that time, decided to get rid of this potential rabble-rouser before he could incite the locals.

If you explore buddhism in any depth, they core in on a universal buddha nature. Like Sesame Street maybe.  <br/>

Also, Gautama came out pretty gnarly sometimes too about being the Big Dog, which may be the part about Christ that you find off-putting. <br/>

      Based on what I've seen at the Asian Art Museum here buddhism is really deeply involved with Hindu deities early on and is basically a lot like the the Christ myth including the virgin birth (itself a fairly common aspect of these things though). I had always thought it was more philosophical and only became more deistic when it moved into the Theravada/Mahayana split and you started to get into bodhisattvas and the like as opposed to the need for a more monastic lifestyle devoted to seeking enlightenment, but no. I was wrong apparently. So very wrong. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end it seems that Christianity and Buddhism both have a lot of interesting ideas if you take things at the most basic, philosophic level. A lot of stuff about being nice to people and desire being the source of suffering and such. Most religions tend to be this way though. It's once you get into how it's actually practiced and the full belief system that it starts being kind of crazy and full of supernaturalism at every turn.

      The part about Christ that I find off-putting is the "Son of God" and "Lord" and "Savior" part.  The supernatural part.  The "I get to tell you what you can and can't do because Jesus said so," part. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My personal view about God is very agnostic.  I don't know if there is an intentional creator, and neither do you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I don't think it matters if there is a mind behind our universe.  Even if there is, even if he is truly omniscient, and can see into all our minds and all our hearts, the universe is just too goddamn big for that mind to really care about whether my landlady and her girlfriend get married. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like the entire planet earth and all its life and diversity and billions of years of history were created just so "God" could get all wrapped up in the intestinal bacteria residing in the guy of one particular specific ground squirrel in East Texas.  I just can't have any respect for that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And if I am wrong, and the Christian myth is right, then "God" knows that I am just reacting the way he created me to react, and punishing me for it would be hypocritical and cruel. <br/>

      My general view is that there is no evidence in favor and plenty of evidence that it is a human creation. Even ignoring that I'm not even going to go agnostic on this. That implies that they have a valid point with absolutely no backing evidence. My thinking on the matter is very much "provable" or "if you can't prove it, it's not true so I won't even waste my time by acknowledging that anything unproven is technically still possible". I mean, I don't do that for anything else, so I'm not going to start here. <br/>

      I am not sure what definition you are using for agnostic.  The definition I am working from is:   <em>Nobody knows, it is unknowable.</em> <br/>

You seem to be saying agnostic means the Christists are correct, even though they have no proof.  Is this correct?  I have never heard of that definition before.

      I think a lot of people get this confused. Agnostic/gnostic is a position one takes regarding the possibility of proving or disproving God's existence. Theistic/atheistic is a position on takes regarding one's own belief. So... <br/> 
 <br/> 
-Gnostic theists believe that God exists and this can be proven (ex: Descartes) <br/> 
-Agnostic theists believe that God exists but it cannot be proven (ex: people who say that you just have to accept it on faith) <br/> 
-Gnostic atheists believe that the nonexistence of God can be proven, usually arguing that the concept leads to some logical contradiction (ex: God cannot be both omnipotent  <em>and</em>  benevolent because evil exists; God could not create a stone so heavy he could not lift it) <br/> 
-Agnostic atheists only believe that there is no positive evidence for the existence of God and that the burden of proof is on those who claim that he exists (ex: most people who call themselves agnostic)

      Excellent definition. A sad, sad thing that I have to v-chub this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In practice there is a lot of overlap between people calling themselves atheists and agnostics and it is not quite as simple. I would claim that most generally believe the same thing, but are stating it in different ways. The boundaries, in practice, between gnostic and agnostic atheists are tricky. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I find that typically people calling themselves agnostic don't want to commit to saying "there is no god" and prefer to leave the possibility open, but those claiming to be atheists are generally a bit more willing to say that there most certainly is not.

      Right. Despite the common refrain from Christians and self-professed agnostics that "atheists are just as close-minded because they say there's no God", gnostic atheists are actually quite rare. When the more common atheist says "there is no God" he simply means "there is no evidence to make one believe in God or conduct one's life as if he existed". Which is the same thing that most agnostics would say. The people who make a big deal about calling themselves agnostic just want to appear more 'open-minded'. Unless you're a serious philosopher, there's really no difference.

      No, I was trying to say that theists have the burden of proof. I'm generally just an ontological materialist. There is no supernatural because if it existed it would be natural. I don't worry about whether supernatural object may exist or that they have the possibility of existing because it is fundamentally irrelevant. <br/>

To make this even more long-winded: if they have the burden of proof I'm not going to even bother acknowledging that it is possible or unknowable.

      I find myself to be neither agnostic or atheist on this subject. I stopped with the whole christian religion thing a while back, but I've never understood the whole "intelligent design" and "creationism" thing against cosmic science and evolution theory. To me, even if you are a silly rabbit enough to think that the Bible is 100% the truth of God, if you are willing to concede a certain amount of symbolism, science and a creator can comfortably exist side by side. Saying there is no possibility of God is just as dumb as saying the earth is 10,000 years old: you can't say something isn't true until there has been repeated evidence that contradicts it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Crazy ass shit like Quantum Theory and String Theory that show the ridiculous amount of uncertainty at the smallest and most basic levels of the universe, where batshit insane things happen and nobody can put them to a formula, suggest to me that there is the potential in the Universe for unexplainable things, therefore a god, or intelligent higher power, who exists at a level we haven't even approached yet.

Ultimately, on a personal level, I just find it a bit boring to say "God cannot exist." Agnostic, now there's a viewpoint I can respect. If you had to pin me down, I'd cold call myself deist, all Thomas J. and Benny F. and shit. I say, it is in the described nature of God that it is impossible to fathom him in any conventional way. Therefore, proving or disproving his existence is impossible, whether through science or otherwise. However, there are also some things in science that become even more hella awesome to me, once again personally, when you think about them as something that some dude set up and then just let flow. Evolutions brilliant way of change by adaptation and only allowing to exist that which can survive in a given environment is a very logical and well reasoned way of creating life. In addition, I like setting off firecrackers. I want to believe that there is someone out there who was as straight up gangsta as to have set of the Big Bang.

      I hate to rag on you because we've already gotten off to a bad start, and you make some good observations elsewhere.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What telescreen has put out is not an invite to the invisible pink unicorn. For one thing, tradiitional science can't even prove we exist. It is very limited. It is a study of our physical environment. The scientific method feeds back totally to rational mind. But humankind is much more than rational mind, that is just that facet of perception that is spotlighted, to use quaint term. And physics is making science become more than traditional. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 There is a leaping-off point before and after physicality that telescreen is hinting on, which physics is hinting at also.  <em>It's implied.</em>  So the pink unicorn is way cliched, inappropriate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it's cool that physics is playing seriously with concepts put forth thousands of years ago in the  Hindu Vedas, and I think telescreen's got a very cool grasp.

      That's all fair and good. I wouldn't so much disagree as say that talking about anything beyond logic and perception is irrelevant, simply because those are the things that language is based on. Even if we say that there is something beyond physicality, that's  <em>all</em>  we can say. "God" is a much more specific concept in colloquial usage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My only point was directed at that one sentence of telescreen's. If you had to have concrete proof that something didn't exist before saying that statements claiming its existence aren't true, then you would need an infinite number of proofs.

      Your point is absolutely valid because his logic there was lame...but forgiveable from where he was proceeding. <br/> 
 Howayyyyver..... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't forget art and poetry are expressions of language also.  And they use things like metaphors, which maybe physics is also incorporating in its way?  It is not irrelevant because it is the tool we use, up to its limits. Obviously you can describe sex all day long to a virgin, or pain to someone who has no pain sensors- there are a few such people. You see where I'm going with this. You can't make someone experience something but you can paint a visual image. <br/> 
 So it is useful. Not irrelevant. <br/> 
 Mathematics- it has rational and irrational. It has perfection and infinite sets. Conceive of the amazing versatility and universality.....step back then and appreciate a mind using an organic brain that can appreciate mathematics. I should think a real math fiend would get something of a spiritual rush from that. It is frikken awesome. The music of Bach and Mozart- math, math, sound as math. The shared appreciation of beauty through language.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Also, logic and perception do not go hand in hand. You may think of perception to be totally encompassed by the 5 senses and the rational processing thereof. I, on the other hand, have a different definition of perception. Telescreen mentions his spider-sense. You may dismiss that as nonsense or bunk, but you only narrow your own data-parsing that way. Not everyone is wired the same, or maybe more accurately, not everyone hears the same notes on their piano. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 It is the nature of rational mind to view everything including ones existence in concrete terms. The rational mind is a powerful beast, and a horrible ruler. It looks to make rules and boxes to fit an infinite reality into. What a brutal dick, if you think about it. Otoh, people would likely be running around screaming and the world would be much more chaotic without the systems it has created in place. <br/> 
 But viewing existence as a metaphor gives a different perspective, and different perspectives are key. <br/> 
 As I mentioned to biff, don't unconsciously impose rules like "that's  <em>all</em>  we can say." In all honesty, we can each only speak for ourselves. <br/> 
 And that is the key that Belgand is struggling with. Science tells him certain things which are acceptable,  philosophy tell him other things which he may agree with, but they do not give him personal relief  from the apparent finiteness of his existence. Established religions are pretty much a lame copout red pill that he would feel worse swallowing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is all subjective, from beginning to end. I can say this and that to try to alleviate Belgand's fear, and it is describing sex to the virgin, because in the end it is about personal experience. Most people are just not that self-aware to the point where it is a living crisis. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The specific word/concept of "God" is such a damned club, I have always hated the word, it is ugly. <br/> 
 You know a word that is much better, even though it is still only a word? Haq, the Arabic & Persian word, which means both annihilation and Infinity. Pronounced 'hack'. <br/>

      Yea, I kinda thought about including an "except figurative/literary language" caveat, but I didn't bother. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You see the point though, in that we have this distinction between literal and figurative meaning for a reason. Even though huge portions of our personal experience are in many ways ineffable, there is a common ground where we all meet and coexist, that is constituted by logic and the immediate physical world. And that is the condition under which the majority of our language and communication takes place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To be sure, it's not a stark choice between purely rational communication or complete spiritual solipsism. There are in-between ways of communicating that go beyond the purely logical and physical - art and literature are good examples. But these are a far less universal form of communication. Anyone can be taught to understand 2 2 or even high-level physics, given enough time and training, because there is a consistent method. But no matter how many metaphors you weave, there will always be people who will just not 'get' any given work of art, and there will be no foolproof or consistent way of making them get it. As the subject of your communication becomes more and more removed from the physical world and the mode of your communication becomes more and more metaphorical, this scope shrinks until the point where you can no longer be certain that what you are saying means the same thing to anyone else, and thus communication becomes meaningless.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is the reason why we distinguish between literal and figurative language, and why the former is considered the default and privileged mode of communication. If everyday acts of communication required the sort of thinking that literary or aesthetic analysis does, society would cease to function. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All of which is to say that when someone makes a statement in the context of regular communication (as opposed to the context of a literary or artistic activity), they are automatically held to the standards of logic and empiricism. So a statement like "God exists" said in this everyday context does not refer merely to their individual experience, but is equivalent to saying "it is empirically and universally true for everyone that God exists". And in that context it is perfectly correct to deny the validity of that statement.

      I wouldn't say angst so much as deep, constant existential fear. I will seriously freak out sometimes in the shower or trying to go to sleep to the point that the only way to get in enough denial to not totally lose my shit and start gibbering is to try and get up and do something else. To try and distract myself enough that I can keep it together. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oddly this all started quite suddenly. I woke up one night during summer break from college and without warning though  <em>"You are going to die."</em>  in the most frighteningly matter-of-fact and absolute way possible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also try not to look into the mirror and stare directly into your own eye until it becomes apparent how much of a merely biological...  <em>thing</em>  it is. That it is seeing itself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
How sleep can be pleasant to other people I don't understand. It makes me think of dying. I'm often very afraid of going to sleep, of losing consciousness, of not knowing that I will wake up. Even worse, if I didn't wake up, I wouldn't even know it.

      I think most people live in denial of death. That is, they know logically they're going to die, but they manage to avoid actually feeling the truth of this fact. Some do it through religion, but I think part of it is simply that it is impossible for us to conceive nothingness, since it means that you would not exist as the subject who is conceiving it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To think of death as simply the cessation of thought brings up all sorts of paradoxes. Would you have a problem with dying if you were assured that at some point in the future your mind and body would be perfectly reconstructed and you would resume consciousness right where you left off? Now what if you agreed to that arrangement, but at some point in the future there was an accident and you were never resurrected? Neither outcome technically affects your existence or your experience of death  <em>right now</em> , only your assumptions and expectations do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I think I've somehow convinced myself that technology will advance so far in my lifetime as to extend our lifespans indefinitely. This is what I am hoping for.

      Me too. We need to be putting as much of our money as humanly possible into immortality research. I read an interesting article a while back about how many religious types and some others were stridently against it though. They thought it was somehow astoundingly immoral. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What bothers me more is the nature of consciousness. Cloning doesn't count. Nor does some sort of "upload" of my brain into some form of technology. I even started thinking recently that any sort of teleporter is basically just killing you and then cloning you. You, as the entity that you currently are, would be dead. It's all about maintaining my discrete consciousness. There are layers upon layers as to the brain in a jar for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The inability to perceive nothingness is a particular issue to me. I think of it like sleep. I cannot perceive of being asleep, only of waking up and knowing that I must have been asleep. I find it very frightening for this and the aforementioned reasons. It feels like being dead to me.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I seriously think that religion calming people's fears in this regard really causes a lot of problems. I know that this fear is responsible for my own pacifism. Life is so incredibly precious that I can't imagine taking it away from anyone unless it is absolutely necessary to protect my own life. This also makes me fairly ruthless in a way. I would have no problem doing anything necessary to extend my own life by even the smallest amount. When it comes to being alive all bets are off. I would kill my loved ones without a second thought if it were necessary. Still, religion distracts people by comforting them. They don't take this as seriously as they need to.

      You're really taking alot of big bites here, Belgand.  <br/> 
Technology is a futile investment in this. It is absurdity. Do your own personal immortality research.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The physical immortality you're on about, I'd agree with the religious types you mention. It's anti-intuitive. No, it's a horror. <br/> 
 Bodies are supposed to wear out and be trashed. That is the nature of the game. Your problem is the common one of total identification of your consciousness with your body. Do some checking around.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, religion is a bad game of telephone and there is so much static it's pretty useless.

      You have the right not to be a part of it, just don't drag the rest of us down with you. <br/>

I do consider the consciousness to be completely identified with the body. This is the only way. Any other method would lead to cases where another copy would be capable of interacting with me or doing things that I am not aware of. If that happens then it is not me. I will not personally, as a consciousness, perceive it, so it is no longer my individual consciousness, but a copy of some sort.

      Before this occurred to me I found my way to a sort of ethical, rational self-interest hedonism by starting with existentialism. If existence is futile the most important thing to do is to enjoy existence as much as possible. Don't be stupid though. I'm not going to smoke, for example, because I feel it would hurt my quality of life not enhance it. But the highest principle to life, in my mind, is to enjoy ourselves. Don't be a dick about it though. This is hedonism as a philosophic principle, not decadent overindulgence as it is more commonly used.

      My apologies.  I don't believe in Christ, not Jesus (that is a good way of putting it).  I read something about the evidence for Jesus' existence being incorrect/biased, but I would not be surprised and would accept a proof that proved he did exist, but not as the son of God.   <br/> 
But the Da Vinci Code said that he was just a regular man anyway, so that was a fail on my part.

I would that that even if you don't believe in God it would still matter that Jesus existed though. He was still a Teacher and his words still affect (effect? what is the proper term?) us today, no matter what your belief is.

      Well then, if Jesus didn't exist, someone still made up those words, but it doesn't really matter who, because they are still mostly very wise words.  Doesn't matter who spoke them.

      It always interests me how the Bible is taken to be completely holy and god's word, but the entire New Testament is very obviously the work of men. You've got the four gospels which just form accounts of Jesus' life from his followers and then most of the rest is just letters to various sects in the early church along with Revelations for no damn reason.

      Yeah basically the New Testament is the boring half of the Bible.  The story of Jesus is interesting and all, but it is told four times.  And the letters are boring and revelation is just the rantings of a schizophrenic. <br/>

      It's pretty shabby stuff, imo. In fact, the entire NT is watered down. It should have a punch to it that's missing. The Gospel of Thomas- very punchy stuff. Left out of the NT. <br/> 
 I think Josephus mentions Jesus in like a single paragraph, and he was mostly contemporary.

      There's very little historical evidence that Jesus existed as an actual person. The first historical reference to him occurs several decades (or possibly even centuries, I don't remember) after he was supposedly dead. Furthermore, the specifics of his story make it very likely that he was just an amalgam of John the Baptist and a few other Old Testament figures, combined with some older Pagan myths about the son of Heaven and such. I think there are historical records of people with that name being crucified, but it was a fairly common name and the Romans crucified a hell of a lot of people.

      That part is very true. The Romans just  <em>loved</em>  to get their crucify on. When you are walking down road and see man is nailed to bits of wood alongside it you are perhaps thinking that this is not good way to live, yes? Was effective? Who is to know, but it was very much a way of the Romans that is certain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even today Romans are in love with crucifix.

      Why is this getting chubbies? I can only think of two reasons this would be particularly funny: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. sje posts a lot <br/> 
2. It is sort of a Breakfast Club reference? <br/>

      And myself. I also grew up in Kansas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is a hick state though. That is why I left with extreme prejudice. There are non-hick places, but even then they are tainted by the overwhelming hickness of the majority of the state. People from those areas (Lawrence, the Kansas City area... I am lead to believe Wichita, but I still think of it as a hick place) do not go into the hick places outside of where they live.

      I will second that. DO NOT go to Topeka. <br/>

Lawrence is the only decent town there. It is too good for Kansas. I think it could be better though. Politically, however, I couldn't live in Kansas any longer and I was unhappy living in something other than a major city and a backwater state. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you have to live in Kansas, Lawrence is the place to go.

Almost all of the peaks of the San Bernardino range and half of the peaks of the San Gabriel range are within 25 miles of here.

      It really depends on where in Kansas you're talking about. I grew up in Johnson County. In my mind anything further West than Lawrence is "Western Kansas" and decidedly hickish. I went to college in Manhattan, KS and found it to be astoundingly small and rural (of course, I also found Kansas City to be impossibly inconsequential and not even worthy of being called provincial). The only time I really went further West than, say, Salina, was when I drove away from the state for good. Most of it is basically nothing and ought to be put to better use.

      I found that Kansas City was, well, not a big deal. It is like Cleveland or such. Nobody cares that it is there except people who live nearby. It is largely suburbs and it is not particularly important or noteworthy. This is applied to the entire Metro area. It is small and more of an regional population focal point than a fully urbanized city. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for football I do not care. I do not think I have ever been there. I do not appreciate football. <br/>

      Unless there is a disparity in height that is causing problems (slightly taller ladies can often cause problems, as no doubt you well know) I do not see why doing it while standing up is a problem. Are you making the lovings too often and it is an issue of being tired? Is this perhaps resulting from your burly, masculine job? Why is it such an issue? Have you simply been doing it too often in this position and desire instead greater variety when it comes to ways in which one may get their bone on?

      I only started listening to the Shins after I heard "Phantom Limb" on the radio.  I had heard of them previously, and I vaguely understood that they would change my life, but I was  <em>busy</em>  and didn't have time to go get my life changed.  That makes me really lame, or perhaps more genuine than the people who started listening to the Shins with "New Slang," but I'll have to consult Pitchfork Media to find out which.

      Personally, I don't care when someone started listening to the Shins, because the Shins are just an alright group.  I think each album has 2-3 very good songs, and a bunch of passable ones.  Never deserved the hype that Garden State laid on.   <br/>

      You have heard them. At least one of their songs has been played on House. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, there is a webcam strip-tease video that features one of their songs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am not ashamed to say that the SECOND of these two examples was my introduction to Zero-7 and that I was more interested in the music than the... activities. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am also not too proud to admit that the former statement is a lie. It was Carmen from camwithher on break.com and I watched the living HELL out of that video. However, I also listened the living hell out of it.

This guy has absolutely huge eyes, like a fucking bush baby*.  This motherfucker must totally be able to see in the dark. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He must be some sort of ninja or other assassin.  Do women find those eyes sexy, or do they find them as creepy and inhuman as I do? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I somehow missed this when it was first posted.  Instead I am seeing it just before I go to bed, so his unnatural eyes can haunt my dreams. <br/>

      The eyes in telescreen's image were photoshopped.  Compare it to sje46's original.  There's one other photo modification that telescreen made (not counting the overlaid text).  I won't spoil the surprise, though.

      Has anyone noticed the mention of a screenplay in the Austin Chronicle piece?  Also: I think why I personally and probably everyone else has been bored with the recent arcs is because they're uber-realistic.  We went from a wedding to Ray meeting up with Tina to them exposing Rita to Connie meeting Polly to Ray Happening to himself around Rita.  Achewood was always surreal and there's been very little surreality happening, besides the talking animals and robots.  We've had Magical Realism, Cartilage Head, various characters' trip to Heaven, Beef's to the moon, Phillipe's to the transfer station, and that's what's been missing in the past year or more.  Not to criticize of COURSE.

      It shouldn't really matter. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Any naked woman you think is hot should do it for you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you have some kind of star-fucker kink, maybe it would make a difference.  In that case, though, only you know which star you really want to fuck. <br/>

The upshot of all this is:  No one can make this choice for you.

 <br/> 
New in this release: <br/> 
1) Assetbarista now does the "^" links even if you are not logged in. <br/> 
2) I've made a couple of small performance improvements to the code that finds and modifies comments.

Cumid refers to the amount of ejaculate-moisture in an atmosphere. How can someone's childhood be cumid? Could he have a humid childhood? Maybe if he grew up in the Caribbean, but if you asked a dude with dreadlocks if he had a humid childhood he would just look at you funny and then blaze up.

      Honest answer? Well, you don't really notice much at the time unless it's especially funky (and not like in a good Huggy Bear/Mothership sort of way either) because it's not like you're swallowing entire mouthfuls and you have a lot of your own saliva going on too. You could pause to notice, but this is probably not best. Let's face it, the whole affair is fairly disgusting when you think about it, but during sex, well, a sort of mania comes over you and you do not notice that what you are doing is weird or odd or at all disgusting until it is over. This is why breaking the mood makes things seem a bit weird as you become painfully self-aware. Afterwards, unless you rinse quickly (and even then a bit will likely persist) musky. Think of how any part of the human body likely tastes. It's just musky and not very pleasant. Just be glad that unless she's a squirter (and the vast majority are not unless they're trained themselves to do it) you're a guy and don't have to deal with an entire mouthful of lady love. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Juices, as you say, are not really an issue. There is some unpleasantly musky odors as if you just worked out a lot and then you go and rinse things off a bit and there isn't much to worry about. It's not like people are just splashing gallons of liquid around. There is very little actual fluid going on in any way that does not dry very quickly. I'd say you're looking at 1/4 Cup at most and that's pretty spread out over time and space.

don't listen to him sje. there's only like a tablespoon of "natural lubrication" around at any given time, MAX. also, musky odors are NOT NATURAL. they are indicators of Being unclean. if smells are a concern to you as they are to me, you might want to find an Asian girl. we have minimal smells and no B.O. white girls have seriously cute upturned noses though. so white girls win on looks but asian girls are hairless and smell-less. omg why am i talking about this HAI GUYS I HAVE HAD NO SLEEP FOR THE PAST 44 HOURS AND HAVE A PAPER ON HEIDEGGER DUE IN A COUPLE HOURS AND A 40 PAGE PAPER DUE ON WED AND ANOTHER 15 PAGE PAPER DUE ON THURS I HAVE ADDERALL COTTENMOUTH AND I WASTED 45 MINUTES THIS MORNING MAKING WAFFLES I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE APPETITE TO EAT AND ALL I REALLY WANT TO DO RIGHT NOW IS PET A CAT AND GO TO SLEEP AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

      They do think that. In fact, most Asian people simply don't have what we would consider normal B.O. even when they sweat, and when someone does, they call it  <em>hu chou</em>  (fox smell) and give them operations to remove the sweat glands from their armpits. I've also been told that they think white people's skin smells like cheese.

      I've heard we smell like meat.  But to be honest and non-racist, I have a Chinese friend whose house smells quite quite odd, and he doesn't smell much better.  Other Asian friends of mine have the same kind of scent but not as bad as him.  I don't know.

      i'm not speaking for everyone. me and my best friend moved to the states at 6 and 7 respectively, and neither of us have b.o. even after heavy exercise. i'm not speaking for all white girls either, just the ones i've been roommates with. they varied in height and weight, and they all tended to have smells, sometimes not even after exercising! just like.. a sickly sweet-sour odor. sometimes they'd have an odor and be in my room talking to me and i'd want to ask them to leave but of course that would be rude, and then i'd feel like a really bad person for noticing, but it's not like i made some judgment about them, i just smelled something! and they accused  <em>me</em>  of being gross for not owning deodorant. i also got to see their winter leg-hair that accumulated, and one of them was a prim little jewess who would go downtown every month to get her bikini waxed and once she was hanging out in the living room in shorts and i was like "OMG Sarah why are your thighs all red like that??" and apparantly she gets the inside of her thighs waxed as well!(WTF)!! maybe i've just had really weird roommates though. <br/>

      I had a friend who would wear these terrible Ugg boots (itself a grievous offense) without socks. She would wear these horrible things until they were dark and brown and thoroughly soiled and then come over to my home and take them off without asking and air her literally nauseating feet in my house. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry people, you do not take your shoes off in someone else's home without asking. It is very rude. Some people like to ask everyone to remove their shoes, but for me shoes are mandatory inside. I don't care about the floor being dirty, but I do care about being subjected to your filthy feet. It just seems like a thousand times worse to remove your shoes inside someone's home. Is so disgusting. If that's your culture, cool, but those cultures generally have this shit down and they've got house slippers and rooms for it and such. They know how to mitigate the main problems or at least have fundamentally different ideas that I can respect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ultimately, for Americans, we are all in agreement, it is rude to remove your shoes in someone's home, even a close friend's, if you do not ask first, correct?

      I can't say because I am not originally from America, but I can vouch that in Eastern Europe, it is also the custom to remove your shoes before entering, and if you assume otherwise, you are low as a dog. And from the fact that Eastern Europe and Asia are barely related in a cultural sense, I can conclude that it is a general thing of decency. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think you'll find that in general, compared to many other cultures, Americans would be considered dirty and gross in many of their practices.

      Girls just usually smell like ten pounds of perfume to me, though.  But I appreciate that.  I'd rather not have the natural person smell hanging around all the time.  Thank God I can't smell myself, because I don't use any kind of scented soap or cologne, and all that stands between me and social estrangement is a shower and lightly scented deodorant.  Actually my shampoo smells pretty good but I digress.

      achewood is the best party ever.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
so i know i made a huge deal before about chicks lezzing out in public, but i think the main reason i'm personally opposed to doing it is because i don't feel like giving strangers a free show they didn't do anything to deserve. i would almost be willing to lez out for assetbar cuz you guys all sort of bought the ticket already by being awesome.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
all the chicks of assetbar should get together for a private lezzing party (is it a crime to invite catgrl? i like her), take photos, and send them to Onstad in the form of a slideshow titled "LOOK WHAT YOU'VE BROUGHT ABOUT". it will probably cause him to cry and hate himself for at least a week, and then be aroused for at least another.

      While I am extremely fond of females, and sex with females, I do not subscribe to the "lezzing out is hot" meme. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like my women one at a time, so I can focus all my attention on the one I am with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I know too many actual lesbians.  Like my landlady who lives next door.  I have seen the women she brings home.  There was one who I found kind of attractive.  But mostly they are totally unattractive to me.  Because I know there can be no reciprocation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Because I know one thing for sure:  The whole point of being a lesbian is that those women are not interested in men.  Not interested in me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I find that uninteresting.

      I have often thought that one of the sources of that meme is from port, i.e. I can watch a hot babe get fucked without having to look at a dick or a man's ass.  I can understand that. <br/>

But that's why I prefer to look at porn with only one woman in it. <br/>

It is one thing to have a physical preference in regards to ethnicity, that is perfectly normal and totally awesome.  It is a whole other manga comic book to fetishize an entire culture's antiquated stereotypes.

It is very common on the internet, and I guess I've just started acting out every time I think I sense it.  This, though, might've been not so well-put by me.

      are they 14? this is generally a problem with 14 year olds. anime can be pretty seductive. then you get into japanese porn and realize that you want nothing to do with the culture, except maybe to watch them out of curiosity once in a while.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
adults who are like this i like to call "culture-fags". basically if i am dating a dude and out of nowhere he offers to climb the great wall with me while wearing traditional asian garb i will no longer be dating him as of that statement.

      I can see where you could get that impression and it's certainly valid depending on who you're talking about. At the same time the child-free movement is very valid and a lot of people just plain don't like children and don't want anything to do with them. I don't like children and I don't want them to be any part of my life. Basically every single thing about having a child seems terrible to me. Well, except for the conception, obviously. Though if you're one of those "we're really trying to have a child" types it seems like you can manage to make that not fun too.

      I'm not a fan of kids, but I chalk that up to them not being mine.  Surely I'd forgive any miserable, drooling, shitting brat if it was mine.

I believe, based on the last time I read statistics on it, that San Francisco has more dogs (based on licenses issued) than children (based on census data). This is the proper way of things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On scale of value dog is much higher than child. But not creepy person who treats dog like a child and buys it useless crap and ugly expensive clothes and such. That person is lower than even child. Lower than almost everything.

      From ~1998 to 2003 I spent almost every weekday after school and Saturday at my aunt's house (several days a week during the summer) and basically was a part of my (currently) 11 and 9 year old cousins' early life to ages 6 and 4.  Plus I have other younger cousins, and when I was much younger, I was dragged to my mom's friend's house, who had a much younger granddaughter that we were forced to play with.  I've dealt with my share of little ones, and, through no fault of their own, they are usually obnoxious, sniveling brats, God bless'em.  I love my cousins, I swear I do, and  I'm sure I was no better, but dear lord, spare me those awful toddlers.  I hope I can handle my own, if/when I have any.

      I decided at 17 that I didn't want any children. <br/> 
 <br/> 
29 years and two wives later, I still don't have any kids. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had a couple of step-kids for a few years, but I haven't interacted with them since '93 or '94. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I dated a woman last year who was almost 40, and had no kids, and wanted to make a baby with me.  Several people told me I should go for it, and I did consider it, but the relationship fell apart for other reasons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have a niece and a nephew.  And between the two of them they fulfill everything I need as far as children goes.

      I would never say that all adults need kids to be fulfilled and I don't disrespect your decision, I'm just saying I notice that a lot of people make the decision when they're still practically kids themselves and honestly, nobody fully knows what they want 10, 20 years down the road.

      My point was, I made the decision when I was 17, still a kid myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And 29 years down the road, I am still quite content with the decision. <br/>

So I think I had it right back then in the 70s.

      I am saying that natural disasters are NOT sociological.  How we react to natural disasters is of course sociological.  But if an asteroid impacted the earth, and killed all but a quarter of a million people, and devastated the environment so that there weren't enough resources to sustain a population larger than half a million people, the sociologists coming up with a population equilibrium number of ten billion wouldn't mean shit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize this is an extreme example, but there are an infinite number of other scenarios where sociology,  <em>the science of human society</em> , is totally irrelevant. <br/>

They are guessing with good probability that the earth won't be destroyed by an asteroid.  They are not saying it definitely won't happen.  They are guessing that it is the most probable thing that there will be an equilibrium at 10 billion.  Of course I never said that they were going to be right about that either.

      I definitely agree. Nobody needs more than one child and two should be the absolute limit. There is not, of course, any even remotely reasonable way to enforce this, but we need to have negative population growth basically everywhere. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I find it crazy when Japan talks about their low birth rate as a bad thing. You have some of the densest urban areas on the planet and you're a tiny island (or rather, archipelago, but Honshu is really what matters) with very little arable land. You need fewer people.

      The problem isn't overpopulation, it's population distribution. There's plenty of room for people in places like Alaska, but work and resources are not evenly distributed. This will all be taken care of when the entire world is just one huge urban sprawl.

      Yea, getting married before college is basically never a good idea. Especially if it's to a weaboo. But it's easy for me to say that because around here it's fairly common for people to stay single well into their 30's. I am told that in other states the people that manage not to knock anyone up/get knocked up during high school usually marry right after.

      Most of my old friends who stayed in the Kansas City suburbs and decided that they wanted to be suburb people who still live where they grew up ended up getting married not long after college. There was a rash of it and it's just now dying down. One or two of them have kids now. I find it crazy. <br/>

Of course, I'm anti-marriage so I find it fundamentally crazy, but that's not really relevant.

      I think the greater issue here depends on your feelings regarding open relationships. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Having sex with someone else? Eh... not so big a deal for me. This concept of "cheating" and exclusivity and such it's not something I really get that heavily. I don't have enough jealousy to comprehend it. Another man is checking her out? This is great thing! He wishes he was making the naughtiness with her, but he is not, I am doing this. He wants to be me. Yet to some people this is a big problem. Someone else is intruding when they have called dibs. Is not a finite commodity. This is making not much sense then to be so concerned. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I go off a bit here. Essential idea is as I stated to begin with. It depends on how you feel about open relationships. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If she's just doing it out of spite to be a bitch though then that's a problem. Still, as long as we're still sleeping together I could probably be OK with keeping it going until I find someone else. Why quit terrible job until you line up a new one, yes?

In a way it's very much like mirror-image America.

      Well the idea is that you would learn it fairly quickly if you are there. My friend went to work in Spain after college with no previous knowledge of Spanish, except for what he was able to learn over a couple of months in the summer. We visited him after he'd been there less than a year and he was pretty much fluent. Of course Japanese is a much harder language than Spanish, but you see my point.

      There are plenty of people living in the US that disprove that very statement. Not everyone becomes fluent. I just think it's a bad idea to be the sort of stereotypical American asshole who expects and demands everyone else speak English. This causes me to want to be extra-polite and not impose on anyone else. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also don't think I could even live in another English-speaking country. I would have a very different cultural background from even, say, England whom we are very friendly with and often share a lot of cultural products with and have a shared background (that we know nothing about by and large because they don't teach you anything really before the Revolution). I just wouldn't fit in at a fundamental level. I even feel a slight bit of that living here now when talking to people who grew up here.

      It's not so much that they can't become fluent, it's that they just don't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are many factors that affect this.  There is the fact that they don't care to assimilate, and spend almost all of their lives surrounded by people who are also native speakers of their languages.  There is the fact that most of them were raised in poverty, a factor that severely handicaps them when they try to learn new languages.  There is the fact that they are spending most of their time just trying to survive, and don't have the time or energy to spare to learn a new language. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So it is hard to compare a well-educated person entering a new country to the majority of immigrants to the US who do not learn English.

no furry jokes please. yes, animals arouse me. but in the way a man or woman would. that is, as a person. that is, as something one could fall in love with. i hope this is not too weird for assetbar. i fell in love with a cat once. in the way i imagine an american businessman falls in love with a quiet asian girl he meets overseas. they cannot speak to one another, and yet her gait and her mannerisms are as endearing as any words could ever be, perhaps more. and at night, she willingly hops into bed with you, her sleek, lithe body curling to meet the contour of yours, and you lay there not yet asleep, she presses her back against you, her purrs vibrating through your chest, and you feel her heartbeat, and you're sure she can feel yours, and at that moment you just know she must, in some nuanced way, love you too...

      That is a little weird for me actually. <br/>

I think the metaphor is not the best though. The American businessman I suspect does not love her so much as he wants to have lots of submissive exotic sex. I do not think this is what you wanted to portray so much as a Platonic form of love. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think cats just want your warmth and to be provided with food. Dogs love you so GODDAMN MUCH, ALL THE TIME!!!* You are the center of their little universe and the leader of their pack. They idolize you and just want to please you as much as possible. I think I prefer that more to the aloof love and need for occasional touching and food that cats tend to provide. Also, I think I said this before, but I'm allergic to cats. My girlfriend has also found herself to be allergic to them more recently. Even if I liked cats more they would not be an option for me. A friend has cats. I can't get into them. <br/>

      My dog is not like that at all.  She's 10 now, but she's still very spry and youngish, but mature definitely, it seems.  People probably always say how smart and humanlike their dog is, but I can say that about my dog.  I used to always bother her when I was younger and she liked me but she would always rather be with my mom or sister, sometimes my dad, but after going to college, whenever I would return, she seemed to be much more content with my presence, just kind of laying around with me, but not overly dog-like, like LICK LICK I LOVE YOU TAIL WAG TAIL WAG.

      Parents' dog is a lot like a five year old kid, at least from what I've seen of kids.  Lot of energy, doesn't know when to stop, loves his daddy, etc. Small vocabulary but uses it expressively.  Takes a lot of naps.

      No, I agree, there should not be a noticeably musky odor, but smells is not my strong area. I have a deviated septum and other nose problems that make smelling things something I am not good at. <br/>

I said there is maybe 1/4 cup for the entire procedure. I don't know that there would be even a full tablespoon at any one time. There may be a slight taste later on, but that is not something to worry about. <br/>

      Apparently most of the ladies in the Asian massage parlors are trafficked or at least, that's what alarmist articles in the paper and activists keep saying a lot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, it's 1/3 Asian here. You have trouble not finding cute Asian girls. Also, it might just be because it's across from a Catholic school, but whenever I'm at one mall I always see tons of Asian girls in actual school uniforms. I mean, yeah, a lot are way, way too young, but there are a lot of different uniforms going on and I always find it a bit odd. I mean, the high school I can understand, but it's got to be more than just that. <br/>

Oh and my girlfriend will likely object.

      Weird. It is the sort of thing that ought to be done to please a lady properly and because you wish to make a good impression sexually, but I cannot imagine desiring to do it. I would not, for example, do that to a prostitute because I would be paying for my own sexual pleasure and not giving a damn about hers (this ignores the other, sensible reasons not to do with with rented partners). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am given to understanding that some people derive pleasure from it, but I do not understand them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, SJE, this is something you ought to do to a lady the first time you have a sexual encounter with her. It will put you on the good side and hopefully forgive a lot of awkward fumbling (there's going to some awkward fumbling) as well as showing her that you care about a lady's pleasure.

I'm no gynecologist, but I always understood that an odor "down there" indicated a yeast infection or some other unclean disease.  The normal vagina doesn't have an odor.  Any more than the nornal armpit.  It takes bacteria doing their rotten thing to produce "stank."

      If you're just sitting there, haven't been exerting yourself recently, and shower regularly it shouldn't have much of an odor. <br/>

Oh and those big, thick candy canes that you see this time of year. Do  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">not</span>  put those in vaginas. Sure it will be a bit minty and tingly, but the sugars will both tend to cause yeast infections as well as just lead to it being a sticky mess with a lot of red dye in the mix. Just buy some tingly mint lube instead.

I totally agree with the smell issue. I wanted to caution the young one that his playground banter was not to be trusted. There is basically no issue to be had with odor, taste, or juices. I would be remiss to say that there is none of that, but mostly that is only something you might notice a tiny bit afterwards.

      That one is so floppy because it is a double-headed dildo, and its length/girth ratio renders it with relatively little rigidity.  It also makes a difference what the thing is made of, i.e. classic latex, or trendy silicone.  That one looks to my eye to be silicone.

      Following heccibiggs's  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110104042210/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uuabVddRz#comment_894">lead</a> , I changed my avatar to a haircloseup.  I thought it would be the start of a new Thing, but now I feel all weird and awkward, like the kid who yells "fire" in a crowded theater and realizes that he's the only one who's brought oily rags and matches.

      <em>Didja bring enough for everyone?</em> <br/> <br/> <br/> I always wondered why it's a crowded theatre, rather than a crowded bar or a crowded sexaterium.  I guess film is pretty inflammable.

      I would think the atmosphere inside a sexaterium would be too cumid* for a fire to start. <br/>

*cumid - (ADJ) - the kind of humidity caused by the abundance of evaporating cum in an area specifically. <br/>

      Panel 7 is so fucking good I just can't explain it. It would suggest that Achewood hasn't really lost anything. Oh. This turn away from surrealness (apparently talking robots aren't surreal enough) is welcome for now. I like seeing Onstad delve into the more personal. That's enough of a rant for now.

      Well look at it this way: numerous people have been saying this for about the past year, whereas if you look at the archives for 2003 or even 2007, I don't see anyone saying that Achewood is going downhill. So in at least some overall sense, it has clearly gotten less good, even if you personally still think it's good.

      I think both of you have decent points. My opinion was that I understand if your taste settles on the surreal and the left field then you may see the last year as a turn for the worse. I enjoy the surreal and weirdness of Achewood, but I very much enjoy straight fiction and examining personal phenomena more directly, as opposed to analogising through surrealism or flying off the handle through absurdism. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In short, I reckon it hasn't taken a turn for the worse but investigating life more directly. And frankly, if that means he'll snap and go off and write a novel and we don't hear from him for 3 years then hip hip hoo-fucking-ray. Go use your talents as they waz intended.

      I am never at crazy parties. I haven't been to a party in years upon years. Seriously, I haven't been to a proper party in maybe three or four years. But the last party I can readily think of did involve an attractive lady stripping down to her panties and showing us all her pierced nipples. Not normally my thing, but they were nice. Why someone decided to stop playing then I'll never know, but she was definitely the type to keep going from there. Basically all of the ladies were at least topless although this was not always a good thing. I stayed a bit ahead of the game because people who have been drinking quite a lot are not the best at telling when you are cheating at Uno.

      Cheating, in real-life (in videogames it is a low offense that makes you the worst thing ever and I would never cheat on something single-player) is a sort of meta-game. It depends on what you're doing though. I need a good reason to go there.

      My first roommate in college would set up his coffee pot the night before, and plug it in as soon as he got up in the morning.  I would always wake up to the delicious smell of fresh coffee.  What a delight! <br/>

But I would never put that foul bitter crap into my mouth!  Yuck! <br/>

The  <em>delicious aroma/nasty taste</em>  disparity in coffee is the most extreme of any food or drink I am aware of.  By a factor of three hundred at least.

      I am, occasionally, trying to see whether it may be possible to enjoy coffee if a lot of sugar and cream is added to it. Not in a Starbucks sort of sense, but a reasonable one. It may be possible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do think that espresso seems like a good idea. Little shots of coffee seems like something I could get behind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oddly I like my tea very black with nothing ever in it and strongly tannic and acrid much of the time. I mean, not when I'm trying to appreciate a fine tea, but for some basic drinking I am totally down with some harshness. Coffee though? Foul bitter crap indeed.

      Premium subscribers generally get a "preview" of upcoming strips (normally the first panel) a good deal before the strip arrives.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
He also posts the full strips on the Premium site, and possibly a bit before he posts them on the main site (at least, I noticed that one time it was like 15-30 mins difference). <br/>

I hope this isn't breaking the code of being Premium, Onstad.  Don't go all Hammurabi on me and put me on Punishment.

      it's clear that Onstad is pretty strapped for time nowadays and is basically never punctual. you can see the man trying  <em>so</em>  hard though, and we've all been there. perhaps what he needs is a little time off, a little "leave of absence" as we college kids call it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
oh! what he could do is remove all the old material for the archives, and reissue them in order! then we get to comment on all of them as they come out! i don't know about everyone else, but i kinda wanna talk about the old strips in real time, with real people around to talk back to me. apparently we never talk about the strip anyway, and when we do it's only to point out how the old ones were better, so i don't see how this could hurt. and then when he's ready, he'll spring a new arc on us. or something. i don't know. this may or may not be a good idea.

      If he's sticking to the current methods of writing and pacing it wouldn't read as well broken up. When the delays were still normal I tried to justify it this way by thinking that I was getting more, but it was just taking longer. But now... not so much. The delays are getting longer. Hopefuly once the book tour is over and the Christmas orders are out it will get better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The biggest problem is really the deadlines. If he isn't going to keep to them (and has he made any of them in the past few weeks?) he shouldn't be putting them up.

      It's all about Mr. Scott.  Onstad needs to adopt the Dao of Mr. Scott. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mr. Scott always tripled the time he expected it to take.  Or even more than tripled.  That way, if for some reason it took much longer than he thought, he was still covered. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then, when he was finished much much quicker, Captain Kirk thought he was a God of Engineering. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, think about it.  It's going to take five hours.  If you promise it in three hours, a five hour wait is just going to leave everyone pissed.  But if you promise it in ten hours, getting it done in five hours makes you a hero. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you regularly fail to meet your prediction, people are going to lose respect for you.  This is unavoidable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you regularly (but not  <em>every time</em> ) beat your prediction, you get the reputation as a fucking hero. <br/>

It's all a matter of perception.
