      I have a question for everyone who's been getting multiple posts: are you clicking on the "Post" button multiple times because it looks like it didn't post the first time? If so, stop. From my experience, it always posts the first time you click it, even if it doesn't show up right away.

      The problem is that sometimes, with my mouse, when I click, it doesn't actually click.  I should get a mouse pad.

      I don't think that the presence or absence of a mousepad has anything to do with whether the click works or not. It's just a button, it doesn't have a mouseball or any optical sensors or anything like that.

      Not the button itself.  I don't think the mouse accepts a click unless it detects a surface underneath it, and for some reason on one small part of my desk it just doesn't accept them.

      I have honestly never understood that. The only reason I can think that people might want to be first so bad is to gain some sort of recognition from the other people who post here, but that doesn't even make sense because nine times out of ten the first post here gets lamed regardless of what it is. Or that used to be the case, anyway. So what is the draw, you two? What aspect of posting first on the next comic would cause you to feel rewarded?

      You may, zapatos, but not because of just that.  You seem like an attentive, sensitive person who would likely know just when to take off the belt (or encourage it's removal), and precisely what to do with it after.  All of this can, and often is, foreplay, and the fact that you are aware of this is to be admired and encouraged. <br/>

When I was on the verge of turning thirty, it occurred to me that in parallel with the notion that youth was wasted on the young, dotage was wasted on the old.  So I made my slogan for my new era "Headlong Into Dotage!"  (I was real big into sloganeering back then.)  I saw no reason to wait for decrepit old age to enjoy the benefits of being a doddering fool, all unreasonable and cranky over nothing and never having to apologize for any of it.  I never looked back. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Geezerdom is a relative status.  To someone, say, 12 or 13, you are already a geezer.  Given the responses I get sometimes on personals sites, I'm a geezer to some barely in their 30's.  Being a geezer is more about attitude, and you've got plenty that.  You just sass up the fine lads, paw 'em til they're like kneaded bread and set to  <em>rise</em> .  Fine young lads are usually hyperventilating by that point and won't notice the rainforest animals on your t-shirt.

      It's what you get for calling me a taxi, you mean scorpio_nadir.  And just to make the image complete, I'll be all like one of those cartoon taxis, with eyes for headlights and a big grin on my face, cause I'm a beautiful yellow taxi 'cause my buddy zapatos painted me this beautioful yellow, and my buddy zapatos is ridin' me  <em>home</em> . <br/>

      I'm not afraid to say that I found  <em>Reign of Fire</em>  to be a thoroughly kick-ass romp. I started watching it fully expecting to laugh like hell at it, but was pretty immediately and lastingly impressed. I'm not saying it's the coolest shit ever or anything, but I was surprised by it. I loved the story and I didn't even hate McConaughey.

      For the record,  <em>Reign of Fire</em>  was the first movie I'd ever seen with Matthew Maconaeagythygh48 in it, and I hadn't even heard of him before that.  So I'm thinking "dude, this guy's a freakin'  <em>badass</em> .  He can be the new shitty action hero guy this era needs."  (It should be noted this was a few years before Jason Statham was really getting his balls into securing that role) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then I watched his other movies, and I was saddened. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Reign of Fire</em>  did indeed suck major shittycock in every respect that makes a movie good or bad, but the dragons looked awesome, the effects in general were pretty good, and there was some fun little images and action shots in there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was no  <em>Hell Comes to Frogtown</em>  or  <em>Black Belt Jones</em>  or even  <em>Future Cop II: Two Faces of Deth</em> , but that's because it was a late 90's/early 00's-era B-grade, and thus a different, gritty breed without the nostalgia feel.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Such is an acquired taste.

Man, all I could do all throughout the movie, any time there weren't dragons directly onscreen, was look at those crazy whispy beards.  I guess they were trying to go with reality by making the actors grow their own beards to fit with the post-apocalyptic vibe when the skills of barbering or even sharpening a blade and cutting off facial hair were naturally the first to go, but the idea falls down when you're making them seem like they haven't shaved in years and yet only have the growth of a month or two.  A spider covets. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And let us not forget the money shot, the very reason he carried that ludicrously fierce-looking battle axe: <br/>

      The joke is that Pat is even an asshole when he gives away things for free and gets pissed when they only want one, thereby leaving the other untaken, where it will most likely stay for longer than he would like.  It is funny because he is using a yuppie neologist portmanteau like "freecycling" to: <br/> 
1. make leaving your old shit on the side of the road sound cooler and definitely something you and your unthinking capitalist kind haven't ever done, and <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. make him seem socially conscious-trendy, but by doing it in such an assholic way he is ultimately contradicting the original purpose of the aforementioned freecycling movement in the first place - and thus further showing that his reasons for doing so are not altruistic at all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Furthermore, the joke expounds on Pat's desire for every member of society to conform to his desires, and not theirs. <br/> <br/> <br/> Discuss.

      I remember your "El Scorcho," actualtaunt, because it was something about dictators and I was really wanting to do the same thing, like, a minute before you did (because I fucking  <em>love</em>  dictators) but I ended up being glad that I didn't because yours was better than mine was going to be. <br/>

Another thing, every single day I am so happy that I have never been to this 4chan place. It seems like some terrible apple of knowledge that just sucks all the fun out of everything.

1. chubbies for grammar and <br/> 
2. lames for being a cock to a stranger <br/>

Also no mention of how Pat is still on Compuserve? It's almost perfect. AOL became far too plebian and common. Plus he likely boycotted them due to the number of discs they used to send out. Prodigy would have been a bit too hippie and was more accessible at an earlier date. Compuserve, however, was technically earlier, but with a command-line interface and was always more targeted at a more serious sort of user who wanted to use the Internet for  <em>serious, important</em>  things and not just dicking around.

      CompuServe pre-dates widespread civilian use of the Internet.  People did pretty much the gamut of activities online that are done now, technology advances notwithstanding. <br/>

It's also hilarious that Pat never changed his numerical CompuServe address.  You could get a more friendly alias, but what use would Pat have for that?

This is hella true.  I used to use CompuServe with my Tandy computer to access BBSs and try to get laid.  My monitor could display 16 different colors, so you could get real radical with how your text would appear on line.  It was wonderful living in the future.

      I know. I only said "Internet" because "pay BBS" isn't really a term that the younger people would likely understand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was an old-school BBSer myself, but never got on with the major online services. I do remember when they first started allowing access to the Internet. AOL with it's crazy little internal browser and such. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not to mention Sierra's old ImagiNation later to be bought out by AT&T and then finally AOL. Wow, that takes me back. To the days when people still cared about Sierra... or they even existed.

      Pshhh.  I'd lvoe to see someone pull a tricycle with their vagina. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On an actual note, I'm totally with you here sardon.  I'm pretty agnostic of PC-ism, and regularly refer to a person's fuming cunt.  I'm even not ashamed to call a person a whiny cunt.  But implying that being compared to girl-junk is for some reason more offensive than boy-junk is pretty weak.  I in fact, prefer a gaping, echoing vagina to a crusty, dribbly dong any day

      Cunt is a gross word whether you're proud of it or not.  Dick sounds a little more friendly. <br/>

      Pussy is very cuddly, but it makes me think that it might approach you cautiously and then rub insistently against your leg, making guttural noises from deep within itself.  Then it would leap into your lap and drag its sandpapery tongue across your cheek... <br/>

      Aside from the roughly textured tongue that does sound pretty awesome, but very unlike every single woman I have ever known. <br/>

I am allergic to cats as well. This is not good. Then again so is my girlfriend. That could be even worse. <br/>

Fun fact: some people have a semen allergy!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Treatment, Resnick says, comes in two forms. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One is allergy shots containing small doses of the male partner's semen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The other is a technique called intravaginal seminal graded challenge. In this treatment, which takes several hours, every 20 minutes a doctor places increasing amounts of the partner's semen in the woman's vagina. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Both treatments require that the woman and her husband have sex at least two or three times a week." <br/>

      Thanks. The last time I did any proper Latin was about a decade back and yeah, my conjugation is rather rusty. I was also operating under the assumption that the sexual meaning of  <em>molestare</em>  would be much the same as it is in English as this is not, of course, the original meaning of the word, but a later usage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps,  <em>molestarem pullae</em>  would have been better. Once again I expect my conjugating to fail.

      Belgand.  It's very simple Latin. <br/> 
Granted, I did misspell Sextus.  But <br/> 
Sextus=subject <br/> 
puer=predicate nominative <br/> 
molestus=adjective describing puer <br/> 
est= verb <br/> 
The verb usually goes at the end of the sentence in Latin. <br/> 
Sextus is an annnoying boy.  Not a sexual connotation at all.  And yes, this is from Ecce Romani.  It seems like most Latin students have read from that book. <br/>

      Ah, with the misspelling of Sextus I assumed, as you clearly wanted me to, that you were trying to say otherwise. As such it seemed like you were using the wrong vocabulary entirely and there was an unnecessary est in there. <br/>

My assumption was not verified in your statement so I assumed that you had made your statement incorrectly. This is truly my own failure. I am shamed. <br/>

      It's quite alright.  Did you think I was trying to say that you molest people?  No.  Pretty much, I just wanted to say a Latin sentence that sounded a little dirty that a large portion of latin students would recognize.  It is, I believe, from Ecce Romani, and I am sure many a immature high schooler remembers that sentence.

      Well, yeah, that's the goal: sounds dirty, but isn't really. The misspelling of Sextus is what threw me though. I don't think we used Ecce Romani either.

      Actually, the program we had consisted only of Latin I, Latin II, and then in alternating years Latin Poetry and Latin Prose which fulfilled the upper levels. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They made me learn scansion. On the upside I got to read the Aeneid (though, of course, not the whole damn thing) in the original Latin which was definitely worth it.

      I haven't read the Aeneid.  I read a lot of Cicero, and The Gallic War by Caesar, and some Ovid.  Maybe some other people, but I can't really remember.   <br/>

Scansion is actually pretty fun, I think. <br/> 
Note: I did all this in my second year of Latin.

      Wait.  I did read Ecce Romani.  It's pretty good.  We were talking about it in my class today.  "Ecce! In pictura est puella. Puella est laeta"  Both of the other people in my class remember pretty much the entire story. <br/> 
Wheelocks is a wonderful textbook too.

Reminds me of a bit I read in an issue of Nineteen once (the Brits have found a way to make a magazine that perfectly fills the gap we need between the juvenile Seventeen which is fairly puritanical with regards to sex and the bubble-headed idiocy of Cosmopolitan) one of the embarrassing moment stories about a young lady who had something happen to her pants, a hole or such, and as she was not wearing knickers at the time (too cute a term, I have a lot of trouble finding it even remotely sexy... then again, panties shouldn't be sexy either so I guess it just comes down to cultural background) found to her dismay that her fanny was showing. In the US it would still be cutely amusing. Her little bum was exposed a bit in some Coppertone-esque mild embarrassment. No, this is England so it meant that she was showing off her delicate bits in what is significantly more embarrassing and not really very cheeky and cute at all.

Kitty is a nasty term.  It's what a skank calls her lady bits when she wants to pretend she's cute and not a skank.   <br/>

And kittybox?  Do you really want to associate it with the receptacle for a cat's shit?  Coprophiles are worse than furries.

      Belgand, this is true only for flowers that are termed 'perfect'.  'Imperfect' flowers are those with only male or female sex parts.  Some species have male and female flowers occurring on the same plant, but it is more common for plant species with imperfect flowers to have male and female flowers on separate plants, like hollies for example. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cannabis has male and female flowers on separate plants.  However, when female plants are grown in isolation from males, and they have been in flower a long time without fertilization, the female plants will spontaneously generate new flowering stems with male flowers, and thus complete their own fertilization.  The production of true sinsemilla pot thus requires the careful grooming of every single plant and the ruthless removal of every emergent cluster of male blossoms.  They can emerge, develop and reach maturity on only three days, so almost daily attention to every single branch on every single plant must be maintained in order to achieve the enhanced effects that derive from the chronic sexual frustration of female  <em>Cannabis sativa</em>  plants. <br/>

      I only took one semester of botany and that was almost... that was long enough ago that if I think about it I'm going to start crying. <br/>

Not my branch of biology. I'm strictly micro to molecular level. None of this unpleasant macro-level biology with your disgusting and dull organisms and such. Ick. <br/>

There is absolutely nothing odd about being a biologist and disliking nature.

      I get what you're saying, but I didn't call Pat a cunt because male genitalia are better than female, but because the word "cunt" is so harsh and caustic. I guess it might be misogynist that "cunt" is one of the worst words we could say, but that shit is not my concern. If there was another word that was as bad as "cunt," I might have used it, but there really isn't.

      I had a weird thing happen with Mahler's "Resurrection" symphony.  I was listening to it and a bird smacked into the window and fell on the roof.  I watched the bird and listened to the music, and I figured since it was the "resurrection" symphony the bird was just stunned, and would get up and fly away.  But the bird was all the way dead.

      Just check out what he's doing on some of his CD's and if you like the material, go with it. My old dad keeps foisting him on me, cause my old dad's hardcore. The Voice, a 2 cd set is very good, plus he does a sort of Bobby McFerrin scat improv as the last track on CD2 that had me wondering what the two of them together would sound like.

      That sounds, I dunno, mattylite, scary? Maybe cooler than pickles in bed if someone like Dead Can Dance arranged it. Hard to visualize Schubert lieder in any other format than he wrote it. <br/> 
 Maybe ultra fucking awesome. Dunno. <br/>

 I heard some tunes, or maybe a CD by the Dead that were redone by a classical group- and to me it sounded atrocious. Of course keeping in mind, that to me anymore, the Dead on their best day are hardly tolerable. I had enough of them back in the day.

      Semen is when you are with your best friend and he is bringing you a delicious sandwich and then you have the sandwich, but you need to finish dressing it so he is walking back with the mayonnaise, because that would be appropriate for this kind of sandwich, and while he is walking back you say something and this distracts him and without being able to control himself he trips and falls and the mayonnaise flies all over your face. You do not want to waste food so you lick it off. The sandwich is discarded.

However, I've always had this feeling that "not pictured" converser on the other side is Teodor most of the time, and occassionally Lyle...it's just intuition from the way Ray is talking.  I don't think it's Beef, normally, as it seems when Ray and Beef are talking on the phone Onstad likes to put in the actual conversation, and not just Ray's side of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In this particular instance, I had a feeling he was talking to Lyle, and not Teodor.

      Yes, everything.  Presence doesn't necessarily mean in the same room, especially if the dogs in question are curious types who have to put their noses into every unusual or dogishly interesting thing/spot/place.  Just in the house will do, or out in the yard.  Nearby is fine.

      If I am speaking to sje, Assetbar Phillippe who is five, you are too young to know about this kind of daddy, and this kind of daddy collecting.  If I'm speaking to sje, 19 year old college student, read on.  (Coincidentally, you are both 19.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mostly he uses OutPersonals.  There are many others he could use, but I guess that's been successful enough for him.  He either hits up the men he thinks look interesting, or responds to those he likes who contact him.  Once he decides he's found a daddy that suits him, he has no trouble at all keeping that gentleman's attention.  (Believe me, no trouble at all.  The kid's seven kinky, mad rutty and gorgeous - at least in my opinion.)

      Even though you are old enough to learn many things, including how to say 'kinky' without stammering, and even though you are close enough to make a drive feasible, I am not the one who should teach you these things, sje.  Unless I have badly misunderstood you, I am not the best teacher for you for these things.  You may yet convince me I have misunderstood, in which case I may show up at your dorm one day with my teaching materials in tow.  But meanwhile, others will have to help you, my fine lad.

      Depending on the lesson plan, they are brought along in a capacious canvas bag, a small rolling suitcase like airline staff use, or for really intensive seminar training, in a steamer trunk.  They are wonderful to ponder, and sometimes, I simply display them and allow my student(s) to gaze, to consider, to imagine, full of anticipation of  <em>learning</em> .  In my small way, through my humble efforts in education, I help build the future.

It should be noted that those who are used to the place don't seem to be as hirsute.  Or are polite enough to shave. <br/>

      I try not get to engrossed in these kind of "details" about cartoon cats, but it's been my theme lately.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've always figured that he's around 16, as he's had a job (Starbucks) and might have a driver's license/car (when he was driving into the lake on the webcam), though the job is the more likely signifier.  Early in the strip, yeah, he seemed a little younger (being impressed by T's cusses at his b-day party, etc).  Who knows, maybe Charlie is the only one who has aged For Better or For Worse-style. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or, maybe, he's a cartoon cat whom Onstad modifies according to whatever he feels like doing that day.

Not that I'm saying that Assetbar needs to become an orgiastic forum where we post pictures of our kibbles 'n' bits because I DO recognize that those younger than 18 come here and that some of us DO have morals, but for someone ON THE COMIC BEFORE bitched (sorry, complained) about how religion forces its morality on others, you sure do force your idea of morality on others. <br/>

      Why do you hate me so much?  I'm really trying not to force my morals on anyone.  I just express distaste when I feel it.  I actually asked Daedala not to remove the pictures of herself, but she did anyway.  I really don't remember forcing any sort of morality on anyone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I do feel like a complete jerk anyway.  I feel like I'm not even wanted here anymore.  Whenever I try to be serious and not act like a five-year-old people misunderstand me and are way too hostile.  Perhaps I should just keep my worthless mouth shut.

Just like I respect your views I want to feel respected as well, not saying that you don't IRL, but some of the things you said yesterday were kinda mean and one-sided. I'll admit that religion makes people do some fucked up things but it also makes people do beautiful things too.

      I wasn't trying to be mean or one-sided.  I guess I was just trying to write confidently.  I try to be open-minded, and I do make concessions, or at least I think I do.  I meant no offense or anything.  It's not religious people I don't like, but religion itself . ..  so I was being mean to religion, not to you.  But yeah, people take it very seriosuly; it's very important in some people's lives.  I just wish that that didn't have to be.  I don't think it has to be.  And religion does make people do beautiful things, but I like to think that people don't need religion in order to be good people or make beautiful things.  That is all. <br/>

      Sardoniclaconic, the latter people are WRONG. The only way that tattoos can make a girl less hot is if you got Bill O'Reilly's face tattooed on your stomach or something of that nature.

      Or the Tasmanian devil's face tattooed over your own face. I mean, it'd be pretty hot at first, but I think It'd get kind of old after a few years.

      Then let this also be a lesson for why you should  <strong>never</strong>  search for "penis dragon" on Google. That is, unless you're so thoroughly jaded and desensitized that it doesn't even strike you as particularly odd anymore. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously dude, I've seen  <em>centaur porn</em>  out there. I saw a series of pictures where Alf has sex with the girl (and boy, but I don't believe at the same time) from the show and that was pre-Rule 34. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, in memory of Dr. Manflesh I urge you all not to read  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201124317/https://www.tigerden.com/~shadow/drags.html">Of Dragons and Humans</a> . Just be glad you didn't have to see the little summary on Google. I really should have made it "penis dragon  <em>tattoo</em> ".

      I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not... Eh. They are basically punk ladies with tatts taking their clothes off. Suicide Boys are the male equivalent. I liked it mainly because the ladies looked normal (which is obviously my conception of the term: normal).

      I am a bit surprised how upset everyone is at my response. . . .  I didn't say they are gross because they are in porn, or anything.  I like naked girls--heehee--I just don't like tattoos or the punk aesthetic.  I just don't find it hot, and I really don't like piercings all over the body either.  And the more naked someone is, the more of their tattoos I see, and I say "Eww."  I suppose I am odd for thinking tattoos are gross.  Sorry if I offended anybody.  I just never really liked any.

      I can understand gettin' huffy if people misunderstand you, but I think half the problem here is a lack of tactful explanation of one's preference, given the lefty nature of this corner of the Inter-Net.  To say "Suicide Girls are gross.  I don't dig on tatts." would have fixed this problem right up.  This all comes with experience. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the record, I am personally down with tatts, and also down with no tatts.  All is cool, as long as she is down with meathooks and chains hanging from the ceiling and horses and goats and mallets and dressing up like members of Taiwanese parliament and shit. <br/>

      sje, I reccomend not posting on AssetBar in a wierd mood. I have done so. It was a debacle. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I basically totally called out loneal for no apparent reason then had to retract full speed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then there was the time I was hopped up on painkillers after surjery and started making fun of people for no reason. <br/> 
 <br/> 
...Then there was  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201124317/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua9Jf0cs#comment_332">https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua9Jf0cs#comment_332</a> , which I don't remember at all -- but I know I was in a bad mood because I remember what happenned the date it was posted. <br/>

      When I was 19 I gave up on looking for women. I said that I was sick of it and I was just going to let them come to me. Only a few weeks later and a cute girl was straddling me in the rudest of spontaneous, unrequested make-outs. We are still together eight years later. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can't say this is a strategy that works for everyone, but considering that it worked for me I am currently 1-0. <br/>

Let me put it another way: I never had to ask out a single lady and I am now getting irregular sex.

      Suicide Girls are usually not gross.  They usually look like girls I prefer to talk/ sleep/ exist with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They look like girls, who take their clothes off, for money and or attention.  I like them.

      Girls who take off their clothes for attention are generally pretty awesome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I knew one such girl who had sex with another lady in front of an entire party. This was most definitely a rad move even though her attention-seeking was pretty much at an all-time high. I do not think the other lady wanted quite so much attention as she did genital licking.

      there's not many things that offend me, but this is one such thing, simply because being an attention whore is basically the least rad thing a lady can do and sets us all back on the ladies-getting-attention-for-more-than-their-looks timeline, and also because since fucking bimbos make it a trendy parlor trick, real girls can't even try it out anymore because it's got trashy and for show written all over it, so then we've got to look to bestiality or something.  <br/>

      No, she was legitimately bi, but she was also an attention whore. The other girl she was with was a lesbian and wasn't looking for the attention. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The reason it happened like that was because they wanted to have sex, but all of the bedrooms were full of people sleeping or passed out in them. Roommates made leaving the party not really an option either. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The girl who liked the attention was into it, but it was mainly about the sex. Still, she didn't have any problem when a bunch of guys were watching them from barely a foot away. I found that incredibly tacky. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personally I was stuck in a conversation with a very boring person about water management issues. I had the option to look, but really I didn't because a good friend of my girlfriend (who had left the party a bit earlier, as is her style) was sitting between me and the other two ladies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can agree that bi for show girls are really annoying.

      It has also occurred to me that most bi for show girls tend to be more of the "Bar Skanks Announce Plans to Kiss" level than the "I am getting naked and munching this lady's box" level. If that's just a parlor trick then that's quite a commitment.

      it's just a matter of how much attention you want to get and what you're willing to do for it. clearly the two are positively correlated.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i mean, you just gotta ask the question, what causes girls to want to be bisexual in the first place? alls i'm saying is, all the confident, mentally well-adjusted girls i know are straight as an arrow, and the ones i know who are bi, or claim to be bi, have hell of insecurity issues/body issues/weight issues and care much more about how they're perceived by others (specifically, men).

      by "much better idea" do you mean a clear, unconflicted understanding of who they are, what they want out of life, and how they can achieve it or simply a high opinion of themselves as an individual?  <br/>

being bi is not at all unusual, though it relies on people's perceiving it as such for its power and mystique. been there, done that. not playing that game any more.

      Being Gay is unusual, being genuinely bi-sexual (not just curious) is unusual, as most of the population are straight. Unusual; meaning, doesn't happen as often as straight people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Although someone's sexuality is often a root cause of a person's confusion in life, it is not a rule that encompasses all Bi people. Making a sweeping judgment of Bi people because of observations you've made of very visible (extraverted) attention hogs is unfair. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kinda like saying all the Native Australians I've seen are homeless alcoholics so all Native Australians are homeless alcoholics. Basing a judgement on anecdotal evidence is silly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, and by "much better idea" I meant they'd come to terms with their own less acceptable urges and this has spilled through to confidence in a number of other areas.

      there is never one rule that encompasses all of any group of people, so i think we can set that aside. now then, isn't your retort to my accusations based just as much on anecdotal evidence? the fact of the matter is, there is no universal truth to whether or not bisexual girls are confused attention seeking sluts. based on my experiences with them, i am of the opinion that in the majority of situations this is the case. i am supporting this not only with anecdotal evidence but with a certain level of theoretical abstraction where i am asking myself and anyone else participating in this discussion where these "unusual urges" you speak of might stem from. there is a clear disparity between the preponderance of female bisexuality and scarcity of male bisexual that i am led to posit that this is a result of a society in which females are taught to base a large part of their self-worth on their ability to satisfy men, and this pressure is perhaps what has catalyzed consciously or subconsciously these urges in a large portion of bisexual women. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i completely disagree with the idea that the urges of bisexual women are "less acceptable" or something that they must painfully come to terms with. it is not less acceptable in the sense that there exists absolutely no societal stigma against it for the most part, and where there might be (with parents, teachers, employers), it can always be easily concealed. so to compare it with the plight of actual homosexuals is incredibly offensive. another point of contrast is that people, at least so far as i've observed, and i may be wrong, are not born bisexuals. all bisexuals i've spoken to have discovered this other side of themselves only as early as middle school. that is not a congenital orientation but rather an  <em>adaptation</em>  of orientation. homosexuals have had to grow up with something for which they were ostracized, and have maintained their orientation in spite of that. bisexuals, on the other hand, have developed their orientation, i want to argue, from purely positive reinforcement. i'm not saying that someone can't go on to be a mentally stable and confident individual having acquired their sexuality thusly. i am simply pointing out that generally and for the most part girls assume this orientation in light of positive affirmation and that can muddy our view, and their view as well, of what their original intentions were.

      My main problem is that you weren't saying "The Bi-Girls I have met have all been sluts", but that you were generally saying that "All Bi-Girls are sluts". <br/> 
 <br/> 
"there is a clear disparity between the preponderance of female bisexuality and scarcity of male bisexual" = also possibly due to the fact that male-to-male sexual behaviour is far more socially unnacceptable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"bisexuals, on the other hand, have developed their orientation, i want to argue, from purely positive reinforcement." I would suggest that bi-sexual men are not positively reinforced and that a lot of the time bi-sexual women aren't positively reinforced (although ofcourse sometimes they are...) <br/> 
 <br/> 
What you seem to be stating is exactly the same oppressive stance that people take against homosexuality. That it is not congenital. Which you really have no basis claiming. I don't claim bi-people suffer the same as homosexual people, they will always have the socially acceptable option. However, sometimes you just fall in love and that's that, regardless of gender. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My whole claim is based on the philosophy that labels like homosexuality and straight, like many labels, (masculinity and feminity) are far too divisive and that most of these things exist on a continuum to some degree. Meaning you can be attracted, as a congenital condition, to women and men at the same time (maybe to one more than the other, or perhaps equally). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Arguing is FUN! Where's loneal when I need her though, that lady's got the eloquence for this.

      Hey now, I am bisexual and have been attracted to both genders for as long as I can remember.  I had crushes on girls in elementary school, long before I understood the social implications of this.  But although I'm attracted to both men and women, I am not an attention seeker.  I am shy and I never get physical in public, or shout about my sexuality for the benefit of male company.  I hesitate to tell people in case they will either be offended, or will think I'm an attention whore, interested in showing off. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I'm not saying I've had it harder than homosexuals, because know I haven't.  I'm just saying I didn't choose whom I'm attracted to, and it's not a tool I use to get noticed.

      if the majority of bisexual girls are like you sardoniclaconic allow me to preemptively eat my words. but then again, since you keep it to yourself, no one will ever know! the question is, how do you spread awareness of something (your totally awesome and non-attention-whorey bisexuality) when its very disclosure negates the content it seeks to disclose?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i suppose then, my attack is on those who do get physical in public and in mixed company. recall that this was originally in response to belgrand's story, and my argument was simply that the girl in question, who he claimed to be bisexual because she was engaging in these activities, was really not bisexual at all, or at least a far weaker form of it, due to her willingness to exploit her bisexuality in public. then i made some observations about other bisexual girls i knew, but none expressed your sentiments, so i am at least wrong in one case.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
aren't you pissed that you have to hold back on disclosing your sexuality because the attention whores have made a mockery of it? not to mention how they've made a mockery of themselves as well, what with guys all over the country thinking that they can just  <em>get</em>  chicks to "lez out" with the right amount of liquor and encouragement... gah, anyway. you're awesome, bi chicks who make out in public are lame, and that's all.

      I'm not claiming that she was bi because of her actions then. I knew that well before. It was someone I knew fairly well for many years. <br/>

The thing is she was both bi, very sexual, liked attention, and enjoyed getting attention due to being very sexual. These are all basically independent things.

      actually, I chubbied your first response to belgand's comment because I agree wholeheartedly.  Bisexuality has been given a pretty bad name by the bi-curious and the attention starved, and it's very frustrating.  I even have a couple of friends who refuse to accept that I'm legitimately bi, and insist to my face that I'm not.  I just figure they don't matter, though, because I know how I feel and I do have people who support me.  In fact, I've told my parents and they seem to be pretty okay with it. <br/>

so yeah, I know exactly the type you're talking about, and I feel the same way.  They deserve your wrath and mine.

      my roommate asked me the other day whether i'd done a suicide girls spread. this was a couple days after i'd shown him my rib tats. apparently his friend told him that he'd seen some chick on suicide girls who was from the U of C, my year, asian, etc.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i told him it wasn't me but it was this other chick i know.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
he said "well not in my mind it's not" and gives me just this disgusting wink.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i heatbutted him in the balls and we haven't spoken since.

      In my family home whilst growing up, we had (and still have) a whole bunch of paintings from when we lived in Africa that my parents bought from a painter there, if for no other reason than the painter  <strong>had no arms.</strong>   I don't know why he had no arms - it's Africa, there could be any number of reasons, and you just don't ask that shit. <br/>

But he painted pretty fucking amazingly, I gotta say.   Not just "for a guy with no arms", either - for a painter, it was pretty awesome. Each one is signed as "By Foot".

      I'm gonna put on my Pat-style "dick" hat here and point out that  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201124317/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe#User_IDs_and_e-mail_addresses">old-school CompuServe addresses</a>  (I'm not sure whether still having one is kinda cool or whether it's  <em>just</em>  the kind of dick move a guy like Pat would pull) were seven  <em>octal</em>  digits, and hence the 8 immediately after the dot in the address could not have been part of a CompuServe address. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, maybe Onstad decided to throw that in there to give pedants like me something to whine about, and to avoid the risk of using someone's real CompuServe address. Sort of like  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201124317/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_(telephone_number)">555</a>  for the Internet age.

2 secs...maybe, but that's pure luck over skill, I'm guessing.  4 secs is 50/50. <br/>

33 secs I believe; my high for intermediate was either 34 or 32, I can't remember which it was, just that it was in the low 30's and even number.

      I love Animal Crossing!  I am, however, sorely dissapointed in the fact that the Wii version is pretty much just going to be a combination of the Gamecube and DS versions, with no real additions.  I know there isn't a lot they can innovate with Animal Crossing, but  <em>c'mon</em> , I can't imagine they couldn't find anything other than including cell phone connectivity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, Harvest Moon.  Achilles is missing out on an entire world of non-violent fun.

      The Gamecube (original?) version is the only one I've played. If I ever actually go out and buy a system (not gonna happen) it'll probably be a 360 (they have better killing games, which do still hold a place in my heart), so this is probably the only one I'll have extensive exposer to. I'm fine with that. As autre hints at, I hear that the others aren't too much different. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am waiting with bated breath for the golden ax. I'm in the process of replacing all my cherry trees with apple and pear trees and I'm pissing hell of bells up the wall at Tom Nook's everyday just to keep my non-golden ax supply steady. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One unfortunate/hilarious thing about A.C.; you can only get Totokeke songs on Saturday night. His serenades are probably my favorite thing about this game, but the number of his songs you have is basically like some kind of a "loser gauge," as every one of them that you have signifies a Saturday night during which you were in your house playing this game. I am slightly relieved/a little sad that I've only gotten one in the month that I've been playing.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for Harvest Moon, I don't think that game is really meant for people who actually work full time.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Hey, rowboat. Whacha doin' after you get off?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Oh, I think I'll go home and  <em>play a game about working."</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah. Not so much.

      Hell yes, Harvest Moon. Not only is it an entertaining experience, but it's chock full of life lessons, too. I don't know how I survived before I learned that the best way to make a woman fall in love is to bring her a bottle of milk every day.

      I hear you, sje. I am okay at social situations as long as I know at least one other person. That way I can hover around them, and when they are talking to people they know, I can freely enter the conversation, and after that I'm generally fine. But if I don't know anyone, I become ultra self-conscious, and start looking for things to do that would plausibly make me look busy but actually just end up making me look fidgety and insane, like checking my cell phone every 10 seconds, or pretending to intently read random wall signs or bottle labels. All of this is compounded by the fact that I seem to be the only person in New York who doesn't smoke. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was all set to go on Friday, but unfortunately there was a Deerhunter show that night. Having both of these things at the same time must have been a huge dilemma for the skinny-white-guys-with-glasses demographic, and unfortunately the couple of people that might have been interested in going with me opted for the show instead. I was dressed and ready to head out the door when the question of what exactly I would be doing or pretending to be doing while standing in line by myself made me sit down and waste time on the Internet until going or not going was no longer an issue on account of it being too late. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I made the mistake of looking at the photos from that night, and it looks like they were a blast. They even had notes about how awesome the night was and how it went till 3 AM, presumably just to spite me. Little do they know that I will comfort myself with the knowledge that I still would have had a terrible time had I gone.

      I, too, wondered this, because my friend had to cancel. <br/> 
I stared at the various interesting books (and Chick Tracts, ironically), and tried not to bump into the other white men with glasses. <br/> 
Other than Onstad, the only person I spoke with was the find gentleman behind me who graciously accepted my request to take some photos of me with Big-O. <br/> 
After 10 minutes of nervous conversation with Onstad (me=nervous, him=cool), I walked right out of the place, and headed home. <br/> 
Basically, it was 6 hours in the car (3-hour drive through the rain, each way) to spend 10 minutes trying not to look like a freak. <br/>

      Man, you guys are taking me back to high school. <br/> 
However,what am I talking about?  I'm still like that.   <br/> 
We white glasses with glasses sure have it tough (write that down: Assetbar Philippe is a white guy with glasses.  Not fat, though.)   <br/> 
I hated those situations, you know.  I hated going to the prom by myself, for example, but I did have a good time . . .until slow dances, when I had no one to dance with, and during the fast dances, when I was too shy to dance, and walking past the photo line when I realized I had no one to take a photo with, and on the drive home when I realized I had no one to sleep with, in either sense of the word.   <br/> 
I wonder what I would do if I had actually had known anyone who was going.  What was I going to do?  Buy a ticket for Boston ($30, round trip, and you know I don't want to spend more than $100 a month) for a half hour, gotten off at North Station all alone, taken the T, getting yelled at by the driver (they really are vicious)walked to where ever the signing was, gone inside with a bunch of strangers, meet Onstad, and be waaaay too nervous to say anything (because he'd be my first celebrity), then gone all the way back home, fifty miles away?  I would be too nervous to spend the weekend at home, because what would I have said to my mother?   <br/> 
"I'm going to Boston to attend a signing of a book of a comic you have never heard of.  No, I will not meet up with anyone fishy." <br/> 
That will seen odd from me, someone who has never shown an interest in anything before.   <br/> 
All this is making me nervous because a girl I haven't actually met wants to go to Europe with me this summer.  :( <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, *hugs*

      I am a nerd girl with glasses.  I went to prom with my gay best friend.  I spent many years being completely paralyzed by the idea that I will make a fool of myself by doing as I pleased- going and doing the things that I wanted to do, regardless of escort.  I promise, people, it does get better.  You start to realize that no one really gives a crap if you're eating dinner by yourself, or going to a movie alone, because they're too wrapped up in their own activities and thoughts to be conscious of you-  so it only reinforces your personal issues when you spend your alone time being self-conscious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Go to Europe, dude.  Have a great time with a girl you've never met. You create your good times, you can't let the rest of the world kill them.

      Not only is KaMeT wise here because it will make you happy, but it will also get you laid.  Girls naturally get hesitant around unsure guys.  Do your own thing, have some confidence.  Approach women and don't worry about being told 'no'.  They will say 'yes' FAR more often.  Confidence is like a ruffy that is completely legal.  If you are doing your thing on your own, women will TRY to go along with you.

      Tripled is completely correct.  If you are at all attractive (like, less than 400lbs, not mangled to hell), women will be okay with your looks.  Be confident, be funny, be attentive.  A women who has attention, laughter and a confident man will overlook a TON of ugly. <br/>

      Many girls do not like it when you can't take your eyes off of theirs, it seems creepy.  Which is why I let mine eyes wander.  Not like, not like I just stare at her chest the whole time, no no. <br/>

      When I say attentive, I mean 'making them feel important".  As in, giving them attention.  It's a tricky balance in public situations, between stalking and being annoying, and giving plenty of attention.  Like someone below me put, the key thing is remembering bits from previous conversations.  Think Mr. Bear remembering all the things he did about his stripper-girlfriend-date-thing.  Guys who remember the details and can work them into later conversation are good guys.  Makes a girl feel like she matters to him.

      The thing about all these 'tips from the pros' is that 90% of them regard what to do  <em>once you are already talking to a woman</em> , and the other 10% are like "just go up and say hi!

      At the risk of sounding like a pathetic college toolbag and creep and alcoholic: alcohol is one of like two ways that I can confidently approach a girl (the other involves 50 feet of terrycloth and carrots).  This not because I am any of those things (toolbag, alky, etc), but because I lack self-confidence because of my non-existent girl track record.  I don't want to advocate only being social with a BAC of .08 but I see myself as less threatening when I've had a few, even though that probably makes me threatening. <br/>

      Yeah, walking up to total strangers is a damn tough thing.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Either flirt with people you are familiar with, or get introduced by a friend who will stand next to you during the initial awkward bits. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, the only cure I've ever seen for that initial "I said hello now what the fuck do I say next" is alcohol, and that's a bad answer in many cases.  Either flirt up women you already have something to chat about with, or have a buddy (boy or girl) help the first conversation along.  If you have one or two 'assisted' conversations, and still have nothing to talk about, she is probably not the best person to be hitting on

    <span class="comment-text hideable">
      Okay, advice for chatting up random people.  Sorry for the long post in advance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
First.  Notice something you find attractive or interesting about their outward appearance, or something in their conversation that you overheard.  Interesting is better than attractive, because you don't want them to instantly perceive you as hitting on them.  Instead, notice an interesting necklace, awesome hairstyle, or cool t-shirt.  Next: walk up, ask about some particular of it, and be prepared to have some sort of response to whatever he/she says.  The important thing is not to reference the person specifically, only something that they themselves have chosen to wear or say.  I'm particularly fond of complimenting T-shirts and hair.. but I like me some nerdy shirts.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
From this point, you have to be a fair to middling conversationalist.  If the target has taken the bait and you've begun a conversation that you wish to continue-  you have to be able to branch from your original compliment/comment to another sphere of conversation.  I usually prefer to segway somehow into interesting foods I've eaten, which then can be shifted over into what they're doing for dinner that evening.  Example. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I go to a comic shop with one of my friends.  I see a cute nerd boy at the counter, selling Magic cards to pimply 13 year olds. I move to the counter and pretend to be interested in pokemon crap.  Without actually looking directly at the person of interest: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kamet: "O, wow! I love that Penny Arcade T-shirt! I totally almost bought it when I saw it." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hotboy overhears Penny Arcade, a shirt which he is currently wearing, and perceives that I am speaking of him, he proceeds to check me out a bit. "Yeah! I really like that strip." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kamet makes eye contact for the first time: "It's really great.  I love that Gabe is branching out into actual painting-  I had always kind of seen his style as being perfect for it."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hotboy: "They really have a good thing going with the daily blog accompanying the strip-  the game reviews are awesome." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kamet: "Definitely.  It's the whole reason I bought Guitar Hero in the first place, now I'm addicted.  I'm lucky if I get time to eat, how badly that game has me whupped." <br/> 
 <br/> 
[end scene] <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not so hard.  Just talk about things you like.  If they don't like the things you like, it's probably best that you don't continue to talk to them.

      Hotboy nerds are notoriously skittish, and are in fact difficult to bag.  Yes, they're easy to hook, but sometimes their fear overpowers all else and they thrash their way off the line at the last minute.  Kamet's technique is quite well-suited to the shy and timid Hotboy nerd.  More emotional than the Hotboy geek, they need careful handling.  In the end, victory is sweet, because of the intoxicating mix of anxiety, desperate desire, and fear.

      I thought about this. <br/> 
It is weird to comment on a girls pants or shorts unless they are very unusual in some way. <br/> 
It is weird to compliment a girl's mini-skirt. <br/> 
It is often okay to compliment a long flowing skirt.  But only if there's something nice about it.   <br/> 
It is weird to compliment almost all shirts, unless it has a witty saying or awesome picture on it, or is cool is some awesome, yet obvious way.  It is definitely weird to compliment a plain white T. <br/> 
Never compliment a girl's bathing suit.  Especially if it's a bikini. <br/> 
It is okay to compliment her shoes, but she'll think you're gay. <br/>

      It works better if I don't phrase the first sentence as a question too. That often offends ladies. They do not like it when you phrase a complimentary statement as a question.

      So? What's your point? <br/> 
No, seriously, it's good pressure, a good point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 I have a friend-  <em>(here we go, kids, it's Uncle Scorpio's story hour)</em>  whom I've known since we were kids in the SDS, good times, those. He's been married to a monstrous bitch & divorced, somehow their son is apparently mostly normal and unscathed. His upbringing originally was from  <em><strong>Trailer-Trash Abuse Comix Special Edition</strong></em>  bad. He's not a bad looking guy, has all his hair, stays in good shape running marathons, swimming, retired guy with time on his hands. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 He'll be in line in the grocery and a girl- or woman in front of him will say something, and it's like he goes into Auto-dork mode. Then later it fades and he mentally kicks himself, or just accepts it with resignation. I've been with him and carried the ball, conversing with the lady just for his sake- it's no use. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 He "friends" with a lady he's met in these biking or running events, knowing in his heart that she's just transitioning to the 'Lezz' side....and he's always right. Or she's totally involved with someone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I'm getting at is it's like there a Cone of Untouchability around him that he himself has programmed and has not enough desire to break through, or to reprogram, whatever. <br/> 
 If you guys recognize this guy as yourself and want it to change, get in touch with yourself. Do some dang Roast Beef affirmations or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 What's that line? Don't be afraid to have some happy in your life?

      I still say the best way is to wait until a girl you kinda used to know through Latin club, but haven't seen or thought about in about a year decides to start making out with you at a party. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then you hold on to her forever because this sort of opportunity will never come again. <br/>

      I didn't go to my own prom, but I did get roped into going to two other ones. One was my ex's, because she'd gotten the tickets right before we broke up. I've already told the story on here about how I pissed her off by making stick figures out of the bread rolls and utensils, but I'm not sure if I mentioned that I borrowed a suit last-minute from my friend's dad, who was more than somewhat portly. The other one was that of my friend's sister, who didn't have a date, so he asked me to go with her as a favor. I showed up to their house with the tux that his dad had rented for me, and in what was probably one of the most awkward scenes ever, my friend, his older brother, and their very Jewish mom were simultaneously helping me get dressed, since I had no idea how to work all the buttons and corsages and crap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think people really need to question this tradition a bit more. If it really doesn't have to be a romantic thing and it's just for having a good time, then why the formality and the general insistence on bringing dates? If it's not such a big deal, then why the hell are girls running around months beforehand trying to convince you to go with some friend of theirs that you've never met and is probably fat too? Why would you agree, as so many people do, to go with a complete stranger just so that it looks like you are able to get a date when this is clearly not the case?

      Ah, now, Rocky Horror I went to in high school. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I did debate and during the forensics season (in my area debate was in the fall and forensics was in the spring and most people did both) student congress so I got to dress up most weeks. Not black tie, of course, but I can see the appeal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rocky, I don't get the big deal over. Maybe it's because I don't like sports. Maybe it's because I think "Hey, even if I didn't win, I tried and that's what matters" is kind of a shitty message. Maybe because it's actually rather boring and not much happens for most of the film.

      achilleselbow, it has come to my attention that every one of your longer posts reads like a bad coming of age movie, except at the end of the movie there is no twist where you show up at the party and get with the popular girl. at the end of the movie, you are on assetbar-- that's like where it snaps back to the present and now you have to do something radical after having remembered all this traumatic shit-- and everyone in the audience is expecting you to get up from your chair, turn off your computer, put on your leather jacket, all love is a battlefield playing in the background, and ride your motorcycle (shitty ford taurus) to some unspecified locations, at which point you will redeem yourself in some unspecified way. but instead we watch you type a 5 minute rant about that terrible 2 hour flashback you just had.

      I once met Nikita Khrushchev's son Sergei (which would make him Sergei Nikitavich Khrushchev).  Got him to autograph a copy of the press packet I got for covering it for the college newspaper I wrote for and gave it to a buddy.  I've also met in person Ron Jeremy, my US congressman, Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell, and had a nasty 1/2 hour run-in with Alex Trebek on the set of  <em>Jeopardy!</em>  that I've already expounded on in length elsewhere. <br/>

The secret with communicating with celebrities (or women, or people with whom you want to extract information from) is exactly what they teach you in Jounralism 101: 1)Be polite, 2) Ask a good question, 3) Listen, and 4) Follow it up or ask for clarification.  Man is a social animal, and enjoys being engaged.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Although talking to Ron Jeremy got me threatened with a steak knife by a stripper, and I didn't have the heart to tell the governor that he still had shaving cream behind his ear.  But this adds to the spice of life!

      the achewood signing was one of the rare occasions where i felt like possibly the most extroverted person in the room. it made me sad that all the dudes with glasses were standing there in line all orderly-like and quiet, just keepin to themselves, but deep down they were working with all kinds of strange cares and rough chuckles and i just wanted to say to everyone "LET'S BE FRIENDS!" but i got the feeling that most of them were kind of too scared to look at me even.

      i'm not exactly sure what you're asking me. since recipes can be found all over the internet, that's probably not what you're asking for. (i have a thing i do with california rolls made from recipes online or california rolls in general where i throw them away.) so i guess i'll give you some tips.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
find a good japanese market where they sell roe. roe makes all the difference in transforming your sushi from run of the mill gas-station sushi to your higher end bar-sushi. top your sushi with a small spoonful of flying fish roe or smoked salmon roe (flying fish roe is crunchier, but salmon roe is larger and gives a greater "burst" upon chewing). fresh salmon, tuna, crawfish, etc can be used as filling. when cutting salmon or tuna, you want to cut against the "grain", that is, whichever way the lines are running, you want to cut perpendicular to those lines, and that gets you a better, softer texture.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
in making sushi rice, regular rice works fine. once i tried half regular, half sticky just out of curiosity and it actually turned out worse. cooking it is a bit tricky because you don't want it to be too hard or too soft. i like my rice with meals pretty chewy, but pretty chewy rice does not spread well for sushi, and dries quickly, so cook the rice to be soft; it will be chewy once it cools. you add the rice vinegar (the white kind, not the yellow kind), sugar, and salt while the rice is steaming hot, but you must cool the rice with a fan or in the fridge for at least ten minutes (better a half hour) before rolling it. never use a cheap electric cooker, the rice will not be at all fragrant. this happened to me once while attempting to make sushi on the fly with a 9.99 mini-cooker purchased from CVS. worst tasting sushi rice ever. the taste of the rice has more to do with what you cook it in than what kind/brand of rice you buy.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
for a good spicy sauce to be used inside the sushi, mix cream cheese with sriracha sauce to create a rich red-orange. if you wish it to be less spicy, you want to stop at light orange. this is the sauce that was used in most of the spicy rolls. this sauce can also be used to bake scallops in. it is the best. chop up 4 or 5 large scallops and scoop 2-3 spoonfuls of the sauce onto them. wrap it all up in aluminum foil and stick it in the oven at 400 degrees. in 10 minutes, you have awesome baked scallops to top your sushi with (just spoon right on top of a finished, cut roll, so yummy). at the restaurant, they heated the aluminum foil with a blowtorch for a minute or two, but the oven works just as well.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
if you want to make something extremely yummy but totally non-japanese, you can fry your sushi rolls. how you do this is you take tempura batter, but do not add panko crumbs, that will cause it to burn and also not look pretty, just regular smooth tempura batter, and dip your entire uncut roll in it, then deep fry. i don't have a deep fryer at home, so i just fill a small pot with an inch of oil and do it that way, on low-med heat so as not to burn it (no more than 1 minute). this works best with a roll that also has cream cheese in it, for taste, and with a good number of ingredients in it so the roll is nice and thick and the heat does not cook through to the fish inside (put the veggies on the bottom as you roll it so the fish is more towards the center). allow it to cool on a paper napkin for a minute, then cut.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
as for tartar, it is easy to make, but expensive to make. i have made it with friends(sushi chefs) from the restuarant where we stole the strip steak from the freezer, took it to someone's house, and chopped it up there, so i've never bought it in a market. but the ingredients are easy: ketchup, finely chopped onions, worchestire sauce, hot sauce, and a raw egg. i remember how easy it was because we were all totally stoned and still able to whip up this so-called "gourmet" dish without even having to leave the house for ingredients. the meat you cut into thin slices and then chop finely with a butchers knife, until each small chunk is about 1/4 inch wide, less depending on your preference. i think some variations call for it being ground, but one of the best things about tartar is its chunkiness, so i don't know about that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
but yea, i was totally able to replicate rolls from the restaurant that cost like $13.99 a roll, for maybe $3.00 plus time input. crawfish goes with everything. eel can really interfere with the taste of raw fish but goes great with shrimp, slices of apple go good with tuna, and... go!

      I seems to describe the vast majority of Japanese porn I've seen too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really have to wonder sometimes is it the intent to make it seem like the girl is in pain and really not enjoying it or is it just some weird cultural differences and to Japanese people the girl is expressing how pleasurable it is and Americans just don't quite get it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Considering the very high degree of rape-themed porn and female degradation porn that seems to come out of Japan (not that America doesn't make a lot of degradation porn too) plus some other elements of the culture that seem to be viewed, from a Western perspective, to be rather misogynistic I'm gonna have to guess it's the former and not the latter.

      Well with the whole, "the girl is in pain and really not enjoying it or is it just some weird cultural [thing]," I am reminded of the girl who loved to be choked.  Not just hands on her neck, I had to cut off a little bit of air intake.  I talked to her about it later, wanted to make sure I wasn't taking it too far, and well I had to wash my sheets everyday that week.

      The secret to good chokey-sex is to focus on the carotids, not the airway.  She'll get lightheaded, have stronger orgasms, maybe pass out (the safe kind), and won't talk funny or be unable to swallow for a week.  Squishing a trachea is a bad, bad thing to do.

      My roommate is Japanese and we've talked at length about this. It's not so much that the girl is actually in pain, but that women are generally expected to act like they are not enjoying it. It is a huge turnoff for Japanese guys if the woman acts like she's into it, because it implies to them that she's dirty.

      I get the schoolgirl thing, but sometimes they even take that way too far. That's just about the only thing though. <br/>

Also, what's with all the harem crap? If the girl is into it the guy is totally oblivious and sort of embarrassed about the whole thing and it seems like a huge effort to get him to do anything to the hordes of women wanting to sex him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's also the sub-set of times when the woman has to be forced into it at which point she will admit that she really does like it. Not quite rape though. <br/>

      No, I'm talking about the vast quantities of incest-themed porn. Sure, the West makes a lot of it as well, but it seems like Japan produces far more. <br/>

Also though there are plenty with a submissive partner the preponderance of unhappy-seeming sex just makes it feel like you're watching the worst home movie ever.

      That is seriously fucked up in a variety of ways. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I thought the typical American problem is the continual fear due to our own self-esteem issues that the woman is never really into it and just going along with it because she knows you like it. Thus there needs to be copious amounts of response to verify that, yes, she is totally into it and loves it and it was entirely her idea. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again I don't get the whole dirty thing really. I never understood that whole virgin/whore issue. I'd rather have the slutty girl who is open about it. How is acting innocent going to make my friends jealous?

      I don't think I realized just how many "severe depression and anxiety problems" there were around here. Listen - if you guys just talked in actual conversations like you do here, you'd all be just fine. You underestimate yourselves.  <br/>

      You can't see how hard it is for me to write my posts.  I assure you they're not flowing smoothly out of my expansive knowledge, fully formed and ready for conversation.   <br/> <br/> <br/> And for that matter, I do consciously know that nothing can or will ever matter, but I don't have strong enough control of my body to tell it that.

Can it be true that the rejection of belief in any sort of value from my mind is the only path to happiness?  Does nihilism indeed rock? <br/>

      Allow me to offer the dissenting opinion even as I admit that you have great advice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When a strange person walks up to me and starts talking I merely think "What in the hell, why is this freak talking to me? Are they dangerous? What in the hell would cause them to think that we live in a society where you just talk to people you don't know without any sort of introduction or other reason to begin a conversation." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Talking to people is rad, but we can't just go doing it all willy-nilly. This is, perhaps, how I never managed to know if people were even living next door to me for about four years and graduated high school without knowing the names of the majority of the people in my classes. I lived in the same dorm for four years and I never managed to know anyone else who lived there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again I went to a New Year's party a few years back with people I met on a bus on their way to the party. So let's all keep this in the proper context. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, the problem is how to initially approach someone and say "Let's have a conversation".

      SJE, you should drink.  Just don't get drunk.  Being poor is an excuse not to drink.  Get money, then drink things that taste good.  You are missing out on a universe of deliciousness if you never drink.  If you are worried about chatting with strippers and fucking Pogo, just don't get drunk.  Two or three drinks are tasty, and won't get you drunk if taken with food.  Don't start with Scotch, but get there as soon as possible.  That is where God will shake your hand

      This reminds me of someone who used to call everyone a conformist. <br/> 
Some kid tried teaching me that DARE makes kids into conformists, when the very point of the program is to inform kids to make their own decisions and not give in to something only because of peer baryssure.

      Bah yourself. I saw pretty much all the bands I ever wanted to see, except maybe the Doors when we left the damn festival a day early. Mike had the car and wanted to go home to pack for college. <br/> 
 I was 18 then and we were too scared to hitch home or we'd have stayed for the 3rd day. <br/> 
 Actually I thought about this and remembered some of the great bands of that time, now forgotten. <br/> 
 I can still listen to the 12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus by Spirit, as well as much of It's a Beautiful Day.  <br/> 
 Also the English folkies like Pentangle and Steeleye Span still sound fresh years later. <br/>

      How is that the roots of both genres though? Since hardcore descended from punk. Emo was a bastard off-shoot of hardcore for people who decided it was a great way to whine a lot and have ridiculous hair. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If anything I'd say that emo has a lot more to do with the New Romantics than it does punk.

      I used to think straight edge was silly, but after being around the drunken fuckholes in college, I have a lot of respect for it. People often mistook me for straightedge simply because I would generally not feel like getting wasted and also did not like beer, so I wouldn't drink at most parties. Even when I go out now, I only have one or two drinks and sometimes none at all, and I only drink for taste and not the effect. I've also always thought cigarettes were gross, and I never got very much into pot, though I will take a few hits if someone passes it to me, mostly out of politeness.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I guess what I'm saying is that it wouldn't be very difficult for me to be fully straight edge, but honestly I don't see the point of completely depriving yourself of fine things like wine just to make a statement, unless you are actually afraid that one sip is going to get you drunk. I also believe that there is a lot of value in psychedelics, since I am very interested in the processes of consciousness and ways of perceiving the world.

      I'm that way simply because at one time I knew that doing drugs is bad, and that smoking cigarettes will kill you, and alcohol is bad as well.  I believed that as an eight-year-old, and now I'm older, so I still believe it.  If I had changed my mind, I would feel as a hypocrite.  Even though it really isn't necessarily a bad thing to be a hypocrite.  And besides, I have never done it before, so why start now?  I don't need it. <br/> 
I'm actually the same way with swearing.  I'm a person who just doesn't swear.  Ever. <br/>

Oh wise and powerful Oracle, answer me this: why do people now have almost no knowledge of the history of the Internet before 1998? I mean, not even going back to maybe '94 in most cases. A lot of people these days even think that the web is "the internet" alone and not just one of many possible protocols running over the network.

      You are a child still. Your generation scares and frightens me by and large. Most of the people from your generation have little to no ability to actually understand and work with computers, they just push the buttons and expect it to work. It's been packaged so heavily and become so commercial that they have no connection to the machine. <br/>

      I meant it in a manner of slight mockery and mildness. No offense was intended. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I say "kids these days" to refer to people in my own generation. I often loathe them greatly for being idiots. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You, however, are definitely in the next generation. If not in the precise sense of "children of people from my generation" you are still younger by enough that we grew up largely in different decades. That is more important. <br/>

My point is that people who grew up after my age group have had a vastly different interaction with computer by and large.

      I think you need to look at it differently. It seems to me that in the early days of the web/internet/whatever, most of the people who used it were techie math geeks who were actually interested in programming and technology and knowing how computers work. The popularization and commercialization of the Internet simply expanded this to the general public. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm pretty sure that the proportion of people in my generation who know and understand the inner workings of computers is just as high if not higher. It's just that people who don't understand it and have no interest in doing so can use it as well, and there are far more of those. And I am eternally grateful for this, since I have not taken a math class for 6 years and don't know a thing about programming. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe you think that people  <em>should</em>  be interested in computer know-how, but there is a lot of knowledge out there. If the dude who writes xkcd could explain the difference between New Criticism and Russian Formalism, maybe that would be a valid point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It does kind of frighten me to think that people with a grasp of web technology are basically going to become masters of the universe in the near future. Sometimes I do feel like I missed the window to gain skills critical to succeeding in the new world because when my other friends started teaching themselves programming in 8th grade I preferred reading Remarque instead, but such is life.

      Lived there for about 22 years. I was also born in Connecticut and my mother's family is from Upstate New York so I have some East Coast credentials as well. <br/>

D.C. only makes it due to being the capitol. If not for that I doubt anyone would ever think about it. I'm not comparing "worth as American cities" so much as "major American cities". Atlanta does not make the cut. Screw the Olympics. I was there for the Olympics, it was still ass.

      I think the problem is exactly that. Chicago doesn't really seem to do much to distinguish itself from New York so it's kinda the backup, but not quite as important. That means it tends to get overlooked. It needs a better identity than "used to be an important rail terminal".

Although I am not exactly sure what we are talking about.  Are we talking about the most important city in terms of business, or the most populated cities, or what?  I was talking about population.  It is kinda difficult to measure how important a city is.

      yea, there's like a certain cattiness to it. like my city can only be awesome if everyone else's city sucks. my best friend (she's at Stanford so she's not an idiot) actually holds the belief that people who aren't hot but especially people who are "ugly" can't possibly live as interesting or as happy a life as she and other "beautiful" people live. any suggestion that this is patently false and that less attractive people are just as happy (if not more) would lead to a crumbling and dissolution of everything that gives her life meaning and therefore she must deny that possibility and retort that if they are happy, they are not happy in the "same way", or that they are simply deluding themselves. this simply amounts to the argument that what is happiness is what i've defined as happiness, and what i've defined as happiness is being physically attractive. therefore, anyone who is not physically attractive, and especially those who seem furthest from it, cannot be happy. this city cattiness works the same way. happiness is defined as living in this city, so anyone not living in this city must be unhappy. it's a pretty poor, not to mention circular, argument.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
there's also a certain brand-mentality to it. like how people in big cities imagine that all the fun times and interesting events are only going on there, when deep down they're vaguely aware that these things are going on elsewhere and people are having just as good a time, but nevertheless there's some essence inherent to their particular city that they'd rather pay the high rent for, and i'd want to argue that it's simply for the name brand recognition of being part of that city. it's the same reason people buy name brand clothes for twice the price of department store clothes when the department store clothes look just as good and function just as well.

      You make a valid point, but it's not always that simple. I was very unhappy where I was living before. There really wasn't much of anything ever going on there. I'm much happier with where I live now and things I'm interested in actually do happen. Going to a concert does not mean that I have to drive at least two hours to another town. <br/>

      identify is a tricky term because it carries with it the implication that what's being identified with is a trait inherent to your character rather than socially constructed or contingent or a matter of habit. i'm assuming you're objecting to my original assertion about having brand-name associations with cities, so i will respond as if you were.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
simply because one grows up somewhere does not mean one must identify with the character of that place. you can just as easily imagine someone having spent their entire lives in one place and hating it. what causes us to identify or not identify with the places we grew up in extend to the broader social influences of the media and the moral/socioeconomic backgrounds of our parents. so you don't identify with a city simply because you lived there all your life, that would be to admit you are nothing but the sum of your circumstances. rather, you already bring something to the table, a set of morals and beliefs and preferences, and that gets contrasted against your city of residence and produces the "identifications" you speak of. it almost makes no sense to say you "identify" with a city you've lived in all your life, because the possibility of identification presupposes the possibility of failing to identify with something else. yet you could not have failed to identify with someplace else if you have never in your life lived anyplace else. if you have identified with your city due to failing to identify with other cities merely from hearsay about them from people in your city or even from the media, this is an uninformed decision and therefore an unmeaningful decision. Heidegger warns about a phenomenon known as "idle talk" in which the "they" (the masses) champion one strain of thought and you simply accept it and go along repeating those words as if they denoted something true or meaningful, when you have very little grasped upon any meaning at all. idle talk is the foundation upon which inauthenticity grows and flourishes. i am getting on a bad path here, where i will say many more words that probably nobody wants to hear, so i will stop.  <br/>

Just kidding, I think you're right on and I have to constrain my rage whenever I so much as hear the phrase "flyover states".

      SF has a good reason for disliking LA though. Both cities are fairly different. Up here we have a very dense, compact city that is very walkable and where driving is basically impossible and highly unpleasant. It is cold almost all year up here and summer is actually really cold, foggy, and grey almost all the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
LA has great weather all year basically. But it's a huge sprawling suburb of a place. It has a larger population and when people think "California" they tend to think of Southern California. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So we're jealous, but we'd hate to actually live there. I tend to think of it that SF is the geeks and the art students and LA is the jocks and the popular crowd. I think the general tone of the argument and the way we each perceive each other is roughly the same. Well, not entirely. LA basically ignores us most of the time. If they ever think about us they think we're cute and picturesque. We generally just think they're shallow.

      Part of the reason is because many of us are leaving places that we found unpleasant. If you didn't want to leave you stayed. It's merely an issue of self-selection.

      A lady can easily (if she's coordinated enough) handle 5 guys at a time. This is the standard of one in each of the major sexual orifices plus dual handjobs. Now, if you have the space and don't mind making things weird we can even expand on this. Maybe, if it's your thing, we can get a footjob going. If you still have a place to stand who says we can't have armpit frottage (gross, but possible I think). <br/>

      Belgand, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this grossly overlooked area of study, but it seems you have overlooked some obvious possibilities. As I said, triple penetration of the pelvic region is indeed possible, and a penis in each hand already brings the total to five. As regards the mouth, it is not difficult to imagine two men standing in front of it at roughly a 90 degree angle, so that both their members fit comfortably inside. Granted, a greater degree of caution is required to keep them from falling out, given that the girl's hands are already occupied. Nevertheless, if all goes smoothly, we are up to seven. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unfortunately, the footjob idea will not work in this scenario, since the large amount of space required for the triple penetration will most likely render the girl unable to bring her feet together or maneuver them effectively. However, if she is on her back, an eighth man may straddle her stomach and make use of the breasts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While it may be possible to increase the numbers beyond this, it is my scientific opinion to strongly advise against such attempts. Aside from the increased risk of injury, the extent to which some of these innovations would even constitute sexual acts is highly questionable.

      Really the biggest problem is getting space for the bodies. This is why DVDA doesn't seem possible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personally with the rise of the Internet it seems like no fetish is too extreme or bizarre. I once saw a website by a guy who had a thing for lady's legs swathed in car exhaust and he had very specific opinions on tailpipes and shoes to make it work for him. He put up the site in the hopes of finding other people into this. I thus tried to think of something that would be likely practiced by a very small group of people. Something that we can point to and still regard as a weird fetish: DVDA fisting. This is, I feel, the new holy grail of fetishes. <br/>

Oh and speaking of Annabel Chong Chuck Palahniuk's latest book  <em>Snuff</em>  was very good and obviously shows that he did a lot of research into these various "world's biggest gangbang" videos that were popular for a period of time. It's also about how people's parent's leave them fucked-up.

      also, picture this. you are a philosophy major, and you are searching online for academic papers on hegel, derrida, foucault, what have you. so you're going through the results from google (jstor wouldn't work i guess) and one of the papers is hosted on a site called philosophyinthebedroom.org. you are intrigued so you click on it. the article itself proves rigorous and makes incisive and persuasive arguments, if not ones directly related to your immediate inquiry. you are now impressed and ready to see who wrote it. you scan the page, but there is no sign of an author, or anything other than the article itself. you scan it again, yup, nothing. you scan it a third time and faintly perceive a small black dot at the bottom left corner of the page. you move your cursor over it and it turns blue. you have found a link! the link leads you to a picture of a girl. she is beautiful but unglamourous. striking but subdued. there is a brief biography located below the photo, and it appears that this is the girl who penned the paper you just read. at this point you are thinking, "geez, what a cryptic way to go about designing one's homepage, this chick is seriously self-absorbed. and yet, i can't seem to look away. she is like an angel. i want to know  <em>everything</em>  about her."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
at the bottom of this page, a link glows pale red against the black background. it reads:  <em>want to see more?</em>  "fuck yes" you mutter to yourself and click it immediately, expecting to encounter more of her papers or a list of her favorite hobbies. what pops up instead are video thumbnails of her getting gangbanged by 10 dudes at once. 29.99/month unlimited access, whaddaya say?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
you then realize the rest of the website is made up of girls just like her. totally fucking brilliant, ready to publish, hot cumdumpster skanks.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i was told that this idea is terrible and "hair-brained" because it is too much of a niche market, because no one wants to watch porn and read philosophy at the same time, and because no one cares if the women they're watching in porn can write a good philosophy paper because they're not going to be your girlfriend. i dunno. i thought it was pretty awesome.

      Hey everybody, Tekende watches gay porno! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Actually I just watched a scene with armpit sex the other day. The girl was giving one guy head and jerking another guy off, and then when she let go of the second guy for a second, he stuck it under her armpit and thrust it back and forth a few times. She didn't even seem to notice and it didn't really seem weird until the sentence "he's fucking her armpit" formed in my head. <br/>

      I know it's common, but who wants to be the dude getting a handjob? It just seems sort of dismissive when you think about it. I mean, I get the idea being presented "she needs this so badly and wants so much dicking that she is getting as much going as she possibly can at the moment", but really... I'd rather wait my turn. The handjob is fit only for fumbling young people sex and times of absolute last resort.

i didn't reply when you asked cuz um.. well being that i was new and stuff, i thought offering myself up as an assetbar signing-goer would have just been  <em>arrogant</em> . sorry.  <br/>

i think you would've seen me though, i was kind of hard to miss. did you get there right at 5? i got there at 5:30. maybe you were one of the lucky early-goers who got to talk to him at ease without being handed abilify post-its on which to write your name and character desired to make it a fucking assembly line that was hell of lame.  <br/>

      No big whoop.  We would have probably had a conversation as awkward and goony as mine with Onstad.  I  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">did</span>  get there right at 5, so I was maybe fifth in line, and I got to chat a bit.  I left wondering whether everyone would get to meet him, since he already mentioned he had to catch a plane immediately after the signing.  I'm glad you got to expose your foily contraption--made for great pics. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, besides you, me and pogo, I don't know of any others who are within the 4-hour-reasonable-drive-to-meet-strange-nerds zone.  (Since I believe falseprophet has left the region.)  So, our midwestern affiliation might be lacking.  However, I would totally be down with hosting a party at my place--we could all perform "Livin' At The Corner Of Dude & Catastrophe" on Rock Band, and drink tequila until we are no longer afraid of the police.

You're about an hour or so away from me, Nice, on the old Albany-Hartford turnpike.  Pity there stopped being good reasons to travel between Albany and Hartford some time shortly after the Civil War.  My little, dying town's only purpose these days is as a venue for fast food places catering to the local community college students and the people who are passing through to other more interesting places.

Still, as I skipped it I felt bad for both not going (as opposed to... hmm, actually I think I bought Arkham Horror and then stayed up all night playing it with a friend because he wanted to stay up all night for his trip to Zurich) and for squandering an opportunity that other people would have liked to have had. <br/>

      Very true. But post-Busiek modern Conan just got tired. Even when he was still on the book it got a bit tired and Dark Horse just kept pulling out tons of spin-offs, but in the beginning it was awesome and had great art as well as great writing.

      Well, the canon would, of course include Eraserhead (and the rest of Lynch's works) and Cronenberg's body horror works (and not his more mainstream stuff like The Dead Space). Lets also add in Uzumaki, Tetsuo: The Iron Man, Gummo, Electric Dragon 80,000 Volts (I saw it last night and did not care for it, it had maybe 15 minutes of material stretched to 50 minutes, but some people really like it), Gozu, maybe Ichi the Killer (more violent than weird most of the time, but still awesome), Suicide Circle, Wild Zero (if you liked Six String Samurai I suspect you'll love this)... uh, why is this almost all Asian films for some reason? Let's throw in some Jan Svankmeyer films (Alice might be a good starting place, it was for me), El Topo, The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai, Forbidden Zone, Crimewave (The Coen Bros. write a Sam Raimi-directed film with Bruce Campbell playing "Renaldo the Heel"; it was surprisingly bad although it has a following), Motorama.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hmm... that ought to keep you going for a while. Depends sometimes on what you mean by weird. Are you looking for surreal, artistic, aggressively weird? There are a lot of categories to choose from.

Gummo isn't good, but it does have a scene where a drunken hick wrestles a chair. In another a child sits in a tub of filthy-looking bathwater and eats a plate of spaghetti.

      Alice is a good starting place. Conspirators of Pleasure after that, then Faust. Svankmeyer can be followed up with Happiness of the Katakuris, a suspense kareoke with Svankmeyer-esque claymation sequences, but you need to watch it with a friend, and possibly while smoking drugs. then Visitor Q, another Miike film that i found pretty poignant, full of social commentary, and with lots of goodies thrown in for good measure (incest, necrophilia, drugs, domestic violence, lactation, etc.). Ichi of course, but skip Audition.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
in terms of Cronenberg, Dead Ringers is my personal favorite. the classics: Videodrome and Existenz, if you haven't seen them already. skip Scanners and The Dead Zone. i have yet to see Crash, but am working on it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
total sidebar-- VAMPIRE HUNTER D, if you haven't seen it already. it's not weird, it's just pure unadulterated awesome. watch it. love it. paypal me $20.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
oh, Mysterious Skin! UFOs, child molestation, and gay prostitutes. and Joseph Gordon Levitt. he is nearly naked in this movie, and displays my definition of the perfect male body. not that that's why i love the movie, but it doesn't hurt.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
everything i've listed here (with the exception of Svankmeyer, but you've got to see that for its innovative stop-animation and beautiful surrealist arrangements, and Miike's Happiness) is pretty poignant and like movies that you feel have added some meaning to your life after seeing them, even if you're not sure what exactly that meaning is. i'm saying this because i watched the trailer for Six String Cowboy and was immediately like, eh, i've seen way too many totally weird, non-sensical, silly, camp, pop, portapotty, etc films to know that this will just be a waste of time. like good for a few laughs but not anything you'd ever want to watch again. it's like those shlocky films they always have playing on the tvs in bars but then when you look them up on Netflix they only have 1.5 stars. yea. these movies aren't that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
also, check out Gregg Araki's Nowhere and Doom Generation. i can't even explain what makes them so good, but it's like some beautiful anarchic explosion of sex, drugs, violence, aliens, and neon lights, televangelists, pop culture, self-discovery through unbarred experimentation, and totally fucking 90's comic book inspired valley girl sarcasm (think gen 13) that every time i watch either of those movies i just get totally hyped up about  <em>being alive</em> . i don't think Nowhere is available on dvd. rent it on VHS. it will be so worth it.

      I thought about including Happiness of the Katakuris, but I didn't want to add even more Miike. I can't believe I didn't bring up Visitor Q. The choice between that and Gozu is a bit tough. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was at a bar once waiting for a band to start and they were showing Chungking Express. It was a somewhat odd choice I thought. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Quay Brothers would also be the obvious suggestion if Jan Svankmeyer turns out to be to your liking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really ought to have given more attention to formatting rather than just a huge stream of consciousness list. That is basically impossible to read. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Crash was enjoyable, but definitely not weird enough to make the list. Cronenberg's latest work (A History of Violence, Eastern Promises) should also be avoided if you're looking for weird. They're good in their own ways, but they seem almost totally unrelated to his previous work. Naked Lunch also deserves to be up there. I'd say to keep it until after Videodrome and Existenz.

      Sukiyaki Western Django is a remake of A Fistful of Dollars itself a remake of Yojimbo. So now we have a Japanese director making a samurai western based on a western adapted from a samurai film by a Japanese director. I'm sure Miike had this in mind, but still. It's damn circular. I have heard, in general, not good things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also it's not yet out on DVD. I believe it's still in theaters in the US. I know it was showing nearby just a few weeks ago.

      There's a big difference between remake and a tip of the 10-gallon respectful tribute. This has mad respectful tribute to Fistful as well as Shakespeare's War of the Roses. And maybe more. Plus historical reference to Japanese tribal/familial Hatfields-McCoy stuff.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Otherwise, Tarantino would not be acting in it. Is my take. <br/> 
It may even become a game to find all the tributes in it.

      Damn, I had to check to see whether I mentioned Zardoz because that is totally a film that I have seen. I tend to go more towards horrible than awesomely horrible. Too much horrible to be overriden by the amazing camp of it all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Battle Royale was awesome as well. But it's not really at all weird. It's also not available in the US in any proper format. When I have to go to a website to catalog the differences in the various import copies I could get and find that none of them is appropriate (I prefer the special edition, but I don't think there's a version available that doesn't have terrible subtitles for the added scenes). I'd say that if you want to see it downloading a copy and then passing it a proper sub file is the way to go. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That or just ripping your version and re-subbing it. I honestly do not want to encourage anything even remotely illegal. That is not my way.

      Basically. There is also homoerotic subtext, but if you look hard enough you can find that in all Palahniuk books. In  <em>Lullaby</em>  he basically comes right out and says that one dude is having sex with another dude. <br/>

      I thought the movie was actually pretty good, though I was in high school when I saw it. Generally, I get the impression that a movie made from a Palahniuk book would generally be better than the source material, since you wouldn't have to deal with his awful prose, and contrived-sounding one-liners just work better in film than in text. I haven't seen Choke yet, but I heard they sort of made it into a comedy.

      Well Choke IS supposed to be a dark romantic comedy, but they focused more on the COMEDY aspect and not so much on the DARK part. <br/> 
 <br/> 
but seriously, a mainstream movie based on Choke would not work, so it didn't work.

      Choke also wasn't that good of a book. I wanted to like it, but it never really came together for me. Apparently some people really like it, but I've found a lot of others who express indifference. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still wish we'd gotten that adaptation of Survivor with Kevin Spacey.

      It's a stupid move because - SPOILER WARNING - if you think about it, the entire fight club came about because two dudes saw another dude  <em>beating himself up</em>  and decided this was a great idea and more people needed to be involved.

      I get the point of the story. But the story is not, in my opinion, well-constructed. And the ending really angered me because it was both stupid and a total cop-out. <br/>

the assumption we made, and i'm not sure why, was that he blew out his medulla oblongata which was the seat of aggression. in retrospect, it's a pretty terrible theory. <br/> 
 <br/> 
however, i continue to love that movie for it's violent campiness, it's quite deft handling of questions of identity and selfhood, and the fact that it, as a mainstream movie, did a great job delineating between sex and intimacy, as well as dissecting the anatomy of both. <br/> 
 <br/> 
also. you know. lots of fighting.

      The problem is the fighting really. That's what made the trailer for it make it seem like such a terrible movie. I, and others, got the impression that it was about a guy who falls in with Brad Pitt playing Hollywood Pretty Boy in an underground bare-knuckle boxing group and then it starts to get out of control. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Technically that is more or less correct, but also completely wrong. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess it's hard to deal with the deeper themes about male identity in the modern era, nihilism as a path to redemption, commentary on consumer culture, etc. but I know that when I first saw the trailer I thought it was just a lame movie where Brad Pitt hit things. Thankfully I read a bit more about it and was able to see while it was still in theaters. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is a terrible theory though. I thought the film showed it visually pretty well by placing Tyler directly in the line of fire and showing him with his cheek torn open and no other serious damage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
True the book made it obvious as well, but it also kept up the hole in his cheek that never really closed up so he ended up with a Glasgow smile.

      agreed. i went into it basically tabula rossa, as i had been kneedeep in the kissing disease for the big publicity buildup. having absolutely no idea what kind of film i was about to watch made it much more fun to follow along. and very few movies have spent as much time on detailing as that one, from the excellent ikea sweep of the apartment to all the little single frames of pitt, it's very rewarding to the attentive viewer.

      This is actually a decent theory, but since he is first seen in that and then on the moving walkway in the airport perhaps Tyler is a real guy. That is, he is based on a real guy that the narrator saw one time and subconsciously thought was cool. That he wanted to be like. <br/>

The difference between their meeting in the book and movie really says a lot about each version. I like them both, but realize that they are subtly and importantly different.

      Most movies with a plot twist are very obvious to spot because they keep using the same damn plot twists and attempts at distraction that everyone else has already used. That or like The Sixth Sense they ask you to just ignore them showing Bruce Willis totally getting shot in the first five minutes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fight Club actually had a really good twist and it worked well. I totally didn't see it coming until fairly close to the reveal when they started hinting pretty hard. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Sting was totally not good to me because the twist was incredibly obvious. House of Games was enjoyable, but it too was really obvious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some free advice: almost every single movie about con men hinges on the fact that in the end the movie is trying to con you. Once you're in on this it's usually easy to spot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It also helps to live your life constantly expecting that everyone is trying to con you in some, perhaps highly abstract and involved manner.  <em>Do not let them con you! You know their game!</em>

      Really though, what's the point of watching a movie where the narrator  <strong>lies to you</strong> ?  What exactly are you watching, and why?  It's fictional fiction, they're not even pretending that it happened or could happen.

      You've gone where I can follow you. My issue is more with movies that have obvious plot twists and are completely worthless (or severely diminished) if you are never fooled. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, I loathed the Sixth Sense because there wasn't anything to it if you figured out the twist in the beginning. It just became tedious.

      oh come on stereo. because it's fun. how far into the murder mystery did you solve it (if they're playing fair and you're fairly intelligent, it should come somewhere in the second act). just how are the cons going to pull of their heist? it's fun

      Yes, but what if the heist didn't actually happen, it's just some two-bit player trying to scam a police officer?  What if the murder never happened, they just want you to pay $9 at the door? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean I can kinda see the intrigue of encountering it first hand, but a movie about it?  Where they can do anything they want with the characters and you can't even tell what's real?  It asplodes my head. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And no I wasn't talking about Fight Club, I picked that plot up pretty quickly, and the entire thing is not shot from Norton's perspective, so if you pay attention you can get a pretty good idea of what's actually going on.

      I did. Even earlier today I had deeply depressive issues and felt unable to either cook myself food or purchase food for myself due to having all this damn food in the house and not being worth spending almost $10 on food for just one meal out of my own laziness. <br/>

Sadly my own girlfriend (ironically enough, Holly) is out of town. <br/>

      Speaking of really annoying commercials, what the HELL is up with the new Glade Plugin ads? <br/> 
 <br/> 
For those of you who  <em>somehow</em>  haven't seen them 2000 times, they go like this:  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Bitch lights new Glade candles. Friends come over, they're all like "whats that smell". Bitch is all like, "Just some aromatherapy stuff I picked up in Sweden or some shit".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then the friends see a Glade sticker on her ass and take it off, making fun of her saying: "Yeah, haven't you ever heard of Glad-ee?" They all laugh at the bitch. Bitch looks sad. <br/> <br/> <br/> Ok. What the hell. Why is a company promoting the fact that their product is one that you should be ashamed of owning because it is classless and pedestrian? <br/> 
I mean, doesn't that break the golden rule of marketing: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Thou shall not make an ad which tells your customers that use of your product will cause their friends and family to despise and insult them."? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, isn't it taught in every marketing school that the script which tells your customers that the product will ruin their relationships and destroy their lives, no matter how funny it is, is just the siren song of the unemployment fairy? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm just...confused here. Maybe I'm too worked up about this. But these ads are on ALL DAY and they are incredibly horrible. I just...I might have to give the puns thing a rest until I can kill the people behind this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I got to take stock.

      Man I love gettin' all riled about advertising.  I have not seen this ad, but my impression is that your interpretation is not what the advertiser intended.  Sounds like a reasonable interpretation, and the fault lies with the advertiser for making a stupid commercial ambiguous on key points. <br/> 
My recent favorite are billboards that say "ihatestevensinger.com".  I was pretty confused so I checked it out, and apparently Steven Singer is a jeweler and dudes hate Steven Singer because the deals are so good they are forced to buy their significant others more jewelry?  It is pretty stupid and unclear, but they did get me to go to their website. <br/> 
I am going to try and not go find this Glade ad...

      I told my friend, as he ordered a bud light and I drank my Drop Top, "Coy you are not drinking beer.  Have you seen a commercial for bud light, what do they advertise?" <br/> 
Women and parties and being crazy. <br/>

Beer.  They show you the beer you want to drink. <br/>

      You make a very valid point, but what I think they wanted to do is say how Glade smells like an expensive product. The friend then make fun of her for being so vain as to try to pass off Glade -- which has been established to smell awesome -- as something fancy and expensive to gain dickish yuppie status points. They are not making fun of her for using Glade, but for trying to pretend that she needs to use something expensive when everyone knows that Glade is awesome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, it's a tricky point and they probably should have thought it through a bit more. <br/>

The important thing is that people who light candles expressly for a scent are douches. That is not the purpose of candles. We already have things to provide scents. Yeah candles go well with incense, but I like to keep my odors and my gentle lighting separate.

      Reverse syntax, compound contractions (I'm'nt, shouldn't'v'd, etc); it's what makes me me.  Also random language changes, archaic phrases: I start stories with "Say, fellas..." and when I see a friend coming I tell him to "Setze on your Platz, there" which would be my Germanglish equivalent of "pop a squat."  And my accent helps.   <br/>

      Animaniacs also taught you to get cultural references and, by extension, to learn a lot more about culture. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was a bit older when it was on and I feel confident that I got most of the references. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, reading Mad is generally fairly good for this as well. At least, it used to be. Best to stick with the various special issues where they almost exclusively run content from the 60s and 70s for that. That way you'll get references to A Clockwork Orange, The Graduate, and Midnight Cowboy when you're 12.

      Oh sure, we talk big game; we say we read Ulysses in 6th grade (actually I had a friend who did that and gave up in disgust); we say we debated Kierkegaard in preschool and laughed over Lenny Bruce and George Carlin on the playground, but honestly, the only way to get to know the content is to be shown the source, and what better way than to have Freakazoid holler in a faux-Yiddish tone or have Sigmund Freud drawn as/ speak as Woody Allen on Histeria?

      It depends heavily on the person, but canonically many roadies have trouble running their lives. People don't usually expect much of a guy who's primary job function is to move heavy things around without damaging it. The latter being the crucial difference between roadies and just about every other profession that involves people who move heavy things for a living.

      Brief explanation: when I first tried to post I saw no posts, so I thought I was first.  Then I reloaded, saw stuff going on, and realized I wasn't.  Then, apparently, I tried posting again, thinking the first one didn't take.  This will most likely not happen again.

      As someone who is often the guy who sucks (and who has depression) I can attest that having a significant other that is willing to take care of you and cheer you up is just as good as medication and therapy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Obviously if you are clinically diagnosed as depressed seek medical depression, but if you are like me and beat yourself up way more than you should, seek a lover.

If Dippin' Dots are "the ice cream of the future," why do we still have ice cream? And why do Dippin' Dots taste like shit? <br/>

I often posit that Dippin' Dots are, in fact, merely the little circles of paper left over from three-hole punchers.

      the man makes many good points. the only reason i eat ice cream over dippin dots is because dippin dots are about ten times more expensive. ice cream is drippy and gross and makes people smell like cheese. everytime i agree with the views ironically expressed in an onion article, i just feel like such a dick.

      The family of medicines known as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Turbochargers (SSRTs) have been clinically proven to help patients who suffer from depression and want to amplify that suffering. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The newest of the SSRTs is Noloft.  Already hailed as a wonder drug, Noloft has broken all previous sales records in Norway and Pittsburgh. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Three out of four toll booth workers recommend Noloft. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Talk to your doctor to find out if Noloft is right for you.   <em>Side effects include headaches, dizziness, and sexual side-effects resulting from unprotected hookups with roadies backstage at a Cure concert.  Amalgamated Biogenics, makers of Noloft, would like to remind you that it is silly to like the Cure.  If you take blood thinning medication or heroin, be sure to talk to your doctor before taking Noloft to avoid a potentially serious side-effect.  Women who are or may potentially become pregnant should double their intake of Noloft, because it's not like the fetus can drive itself to the pharmacy, now is it?</em>

      Man,I got myself into hella big trouble when I was clinically diagnosed as depressed and then  <em>sought out medical depression</em> .  That was way worse than just clinically diagnosed depression.  The hospital, the locked section, the 'quiet room', the painfully lame group sessions, the horrifying wiped expression on the drooling faces of those poor fucks just returned from electroshock.  Much, much worse. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seeking a lover might work, cause you might get dinner made occasionally and maybe get laid some, but if you seek a lover and get shot down because, well, you're just way too depressing to be around for fuck's sake, I mean you're just gonna get still yet more depressed.  This is all dangerous ground guy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By way of ameliorating that grim stuff, I can say that those exceptionally bad times were more than 35 years ago, so surviving it all is possible.  I still have depression, but it's manageable, and I'm still a guy who sucks, quite remarkably well if I say so myself.  Living well may be the best revenge, but simply continuing to live is sometimes a damn good second-best.

      Yes it  <em>can</em>  work, and when it does it's a very good thing.  In my case I was seriously crazy  <em>long</em>  before I was anywhere near being old enough to be in any kind of relationship, so I had to get past that before being in love/finding a lover was something I could even attempt.  I've been lucky to have had several great relationships since, even one that was for richer or poorer, in sickness and health until death did us part.  The danger of having one's mental stability attached so tightly to a relationship is that relationships end, one way or another (people change, people die, stuff happens, etc.).  If in the interim you've not found some other way of managing depression, you're sort of dumped back where you started.  On the plus side, the longer you function free of serious depression the more not being depressed gets to be its own sort of habit, and the easier it is to get out of a bad patch if one comes along.  Plus the right, good drug, a psych who's not a fuckwit (h/t Dr. Skradley), and other good suggestions here at the bar.  (I have to say I've had lovers who made me anything but happy, but them's other stories.)

      I'm not so certain it's that permanent. Basically most of the major cast member have been dead at at least one point or another. Or rather, Beef (three times), Ray (once), Molly (once), Todd (season pass), and even Teodor had at least a near-death experience.

      This is more of an in-between death, though.  They're not in heaven.  It seems to be more of a purgatory.  And besides, he's with a family that has had 1 of (something like) 19 people return in 400 years.  They don't let go easy.  Granted, Ray might Get Things Done in the space of 6 panels but if he does I don't see it happening for a while; LN is one of many of Ray's antagonists, so he probably won't get any special favors for another few months or something.

      My computer "runs" on Windows 98. It crashes  <em>every time</em>  if you quit Photoshop 7.0 and re-open it without rebooting. It has no Ethernet port, only a 56K modem which actually connects at 33.6 or less. It fails to meet the minimum system requirements for Grand Theft Auto III (released six years ago). Its sound card is currently silent due to a seemingly unfixable driver issue, and some time ago a large crack mysteriously appeared next to the floppy disk drive.  <br/>

      There was plenty of porn on the interwebs back then.  Most people who 'webbed on' as we said back then would actually hit up BBSes.  Many offered grownup things.  The trick was hiding the screen from your parents while your 2400 baud modem pulled down a teacher-looking lady with giant 80s-hair.  You couldn't just alt-tab.  DOS didn't really have other things happening while that picture was downloading.

      In the early '90s, our public library had this one terminal way in the back where you could follow a convoluted procedure to access a free local BBS. At least, so they claimed. I wrestled with it nearly every time I went there, and seldom got past the part where you typed "atds," never mind the part when you logged in as "guest." <br/>

Then one day, miraculously, it worked, and I was privy to page after page of monospaced green birthday wishes between Star Trek fans. Capone's vault, man, Capone's vault.

      "We wandered and wondered, together, like children, the earth become our private garden, walled by the horizon's shadow, vaulted by the moonlit sky, the masterwork of an indulgent father. A-crossing where the roads cross, and crossing where the dead lay crossed, and across to where by day the children play, I saw there in all earthly things, in the grass and the trees, in walkways and children's follies, a complex geometry, rigid in its repetition and oppressive in its opulence, the countless bars of beautiful prisons, hiding unknown possibilities to waking eyes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 And so I swung her round by her supple waist, seeking succor in her unearthly loveliness, her lithe limbs, her laughing eyes, her loving lips. Her capering, her cajoling, her consenting and consorting, her unbound by the earth that bore her, her that was then mine." <br/>

Assetbar isn't a place to talk about the strips.  It is to  <em>experience</em>  the strips (along with the horrors and depravity of the Internet).  I guess you just don't get it.

      I am relatively new to Achewood. My girlfriend got me hooked a few months ago. Up until recently, I was reading a few Achewoods every day from the archive (in order)--sometimes I would read a few months or even a year in a single sitting. It was so exciting that I would forget to read the alt text for ten strips in a row before realizing it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now I am caught up and eagerly await every new strip. Unfortunately it's like watching a DVD on an old player. Everything is cruising along and suddenly the frame freezes. You don't breathe for a few seconds hoping it will just keep on playing and frozen-in-time Keanu Reeves won't get shot by some guy in a suit. When it does suddenly start playing, you briefly entertain the notion that it will not happen again; but it does. It does so again and again, over and over, until you are forced to eject the dish in a vain attempt to save your Matrix screening by some mystical combination of blowing, rubbing, and delicate re-insertion.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But you can't really do that with a comic strip. And Keanu Reeves  <em>does</em>  get shot. Now a week will easily slip by without a new Achewood strip for me to enjoy. Maybe I should have waited a few more years before discovering you. Or maybe I can read through the archive again and pretend like it's Christmas morning in Shanghai.

      First they came for the previous strip reference at the top of the page, and I chubbied it because it was there. <br/>

Then they came for the Fresh Prince song parody, and I chubbied it because it was there. <br/>

And then they came for nicm's insightful comment which perfectly mirrors my own feelings, and I had no chubbies left. <br/>

      Word of advice, don't chubby references to the comic unless it's hell of well put together. Is worst song played on ugliest guitar. <br/>

Secondly, nicm, I can't believe you just compared Achewood to the Matrix.  <br/>

Thirdly, I can't believe, out of every Keanu Reeves movie you used The Matrix. Point Break or nothing, holmes.

      You guys are making a bary big mistake. See, Baryonyx will simply search for "onyx". As uncle Bary always told me, "bary a mouse in his hole, an' he'll just dig a new way out" -- we must involve onyx (coincidentally, my favorite pokemon was onix and I missed the word "onyx" in the 4th grade spelling bee because of that fucking rocksnake) if we wish to complete our bary important task or ruining baryonyx's search laziness.  <br/>

Common mistranslation (I was taking Russian in high school at the time).  Nikita was actually talking about the success of the communist economy, and saying they would overtake the U.S. in production, then he got a little slangy about it, and "overtake" became "bury" in some listener's ears, especially the propoganda cold warriors on our side.

      It's ambiguous. The word he used was "pohoronim," which is the future tense of "pohoronit". "Pohoroni" is the Russian word for funeral, so the verb "pohoronit" literally means something like "to perform the actions that are commonly performed at a funeral," with the direct object being the person who has died. It could have the connotations of 'bury in the ground' or 'forget about and move on', or both, which I think is the case here.

That is so not the point, Pogo. Weren't people in your area freaked out of their garters by it?  <br/>

 Who gives a shit what he was actually saying. That damn  shoe-banging act at the U.N. in New York City no less, had everyone double-dogg sure this guy was a gone-daddy madman with his other hand on his nads and the nuke trigger was in his jockstrap. <br/>
