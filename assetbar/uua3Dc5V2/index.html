      the first two triplets are so happy, though.  and then the third one had to rain on their parade by vomiting everywhere.  or is it really a time lapse picture of the one note's devolution into projectile vomiting?  i can't deide.

      They don't really need probable cause if you're crossing the border from Canada. Canadian border guards are all "don't leave Canada without your free hug, brother" and the American ones are all "I CAN SMELL YOUR WEED FROM CANADA." Border guards are allowed to search your car or bum if they have suspicions. <br/>

      Assetbar, I feel the need to tell you that you have become an urban legend. When a train crashes in the distance they will find a penny on the tracks and on that penny will be scrawled the name of Assetbar. When children look into shadows and feel something staring back, it is you staring back, Assetbar, for also shadows are one shadow to Assetbar and what happens in one happens in all. Where Assetbar stalks the corn dies and the sky is bruised and in the far distance towns know the thunder of his coming. When a women becomes heavy with child and feels the pangs of labor she must bury her first baby tooth in a pot of dirt and leave it by the window so that Assetbar will pass that house by and the child will be delivered safely and with no issue. It is Assetbar who slashed the ice cream's man tires. It is Assetbar who has seen the cold, chilly dawn. If you hear singing in the sewers in the midnight belly of the night, it is Assetbar, and his words are spoken with dead men's tongues. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is Assetbar. Always Assetbar.

Probably not as i'm not too fond of republicans/tories/ostrogoths (whatever you call a right winger) but at the time he looked like he had a pretty good resume, former vice president, Distinguished naval record, a shrewd and well informed eye for foriegn affairs, and he was meant to be a pretty good poker player back in his day. it's easy to look back with hindsight and think "How the hell did they let that man in to run the country" but back then he probably seemed the best of a bad bunch.

      I completely agree with your band preference but I am usually hesitant to voice my opinion.  Doing so usually results in some condescending lecture about how the Beatles are directly responsible for every last note and lyric of every good song written by any band anywhere in the last several decades.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't deny their talent but I think their influence is often greatly overstated and they wouldn't have been nearly as successful without a heaping dose of the right place/right time effect.

      This condescension you speak of irks me greatly as well, though I like the Beatles and the Kinks equally. I will wholly concede that they're both better than the Stones. Not that the Stones are BAD, persay; they're actually one of my favorite bands. But when it comes to sheer quality I always turn to Arthur before Let It Bleed. And perhaps before that I'd go for the White Album. Your point stands tall, though. The Beatles, grand as they are, have been highly overrated by their most zealous of fans.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not that the hardcore Kinks fans aren't (as they most assuredly are) arrogant douchebags who overrate their band with aplomb, but as there are fewer Kinks fans their condescending tittering is easy to brush off. You can't really ignore the legions of Lennon, though; those glorious but nigh incoherent bastards sitting aloof as they constantly criticize everyone's taste in music and extol the virtues of "Oh Yoko" on a populace weary of their poppycock. No, I agree heartily. These fellows are of a base quality, and conspiring with them makes me feel like I need a shower.  <br/>

I'd rather get a Star Wars tattoo than keep them as pen pals!

      Breaking from my persona for a minute: I wasn't referring to you with the Kinks line. You seem like a pretty cool dude! I was talking more about the fact that EVERY band has their obsessively crazy fans and the Kinks are no exception but because their fanbase is smaller the efficacy of their angry hordes is greatly lessened, and they're overall more agreeable because of it. <br/>

      Miles Davis' best albums were before the 60's (Kind of Blue, Porgy and Bess, Round Midnight, the gerund albums) or barely in it (Sketches of Spain, Bitches' Brew). While Mingus had many great albums in the 60's (The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, Mingus Mingus Mingus), his two best, Mingus Ah Um, and Blues and Roots were in the 50's.  Coleman's best stuff was in the 60's and Diz had some good stuff there too, but all the rest of those I'd say are associated with either the 50's or 70's, mostly the former. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, Jazz in the 60's was Stan Getz, the above-mentioned Coleman, Chick Korea, Herbie Hancock, and Sun Ra.

      Bowie was more 70s than 60s, though. The only stuff he released in the 60s (with the exception of the track "Space Oddity") was folksy pap that really wasn't very good. Bowie didn't even begin to hit his stride until 1971.

      Bowie was a bit of a stretch, I'll agree, but he technically started in the 60s, so I left him on the list.  I definitely agree that his best stuff was in the early 70s, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars is my favorite rock album of all time.

      Wow, really? As good as that album is, I personally think he's done better. IMO, Diamond Dogs and "Heroes" are both better, as is Heathen (though that was 30 years later). Even The Man Who Sold the World has moments better than anything on Ziggy, although Ziggy is better on the whole. <br/>

      I think so, yes. But it's not an entirely fair comparison--they're very different albums.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But are you really going to deny that tracks like "Slip Away," "Everyone Says Hi," "Heathen (The Rays)," and the cover of Pixies' "Cactus" are better than at least  <em>some</em>  of the songs on  <em>Ziggy</em> ? I mean, yeah, there's some great songs on  <em>Ziggy</em> . The title track, "Five Years," "Moonage Daydream," "Starman"...but there's also some stuff that's really not that great. "Hang on to Yourself" is passable, while the cover of "It Ain't Easy" is pretty bad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is getting too long. I'm not saying  <em>Heathen</em>  is, like, WAY better than  <em>Ziggy.</em>  But I think it's a  <em>little</em>  better. I will mention that  <em>Heathen</em>  took a very long time to grow on me, and  <em>Ziggy</em>  didn't. The latter is certainly more accessible.

      However, Heathan didn't have any stunners on it.  The good on Heathan is at least as good as the good on Ziggy, and the bad on Heathan is better than the (2 songs that are) bad on Ziggy.  But the great of Heathan pales starkly in comparison to the great of Ziggy.  The great on Heathan (forthwith, "Heathan (The Rays)," "Slow Burn," and "I Would Be Your Slave") combined aren't half of what "Ziggy Stardust" is, nevermind that the other greats ("Suffragette City," "Soul Love," "Star") are tremendous, not to mention more numerous than the ones on Heathan. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Look, I catch a lot of flak from other Bowie fans for including Heathan in his top ten (it's 10th, in my book), but it just isn't Ziggy.

      His only 60's album worth any mention was Space Oddity.  All of his best stuff came in the late 70's (Station to Station, The Berlin Trilogy), as far as I'm concerned.

      Space oddity is a damn good album but ' stardust swings it for me with its inclusion of "Starman", what a song.  <br/>

they should really just make Bowie king, it doesnt matter whether you "even like kings" it would be a good idea.

      Agreed. I'd forgotten Station to Station earlier, but I think I might consider that my favorite Bowie album, although Heathen comes awfully close. <br/>

Space Oddity is really only worth mention for its title track.

      "Janine"  <em>is</em>  good, you're right. I discovered that a few weeks ago when it popped up on shuffle. I had somehow previously ignored it, but on that listen I was all tapping my hands on the steering wheel, nodding with the beat, all goin' "this is pretty cool." <br/>

I also like "Don't Sit Down," but it's pretty much a throwaway track, so I don't think it counts for much.

      You know what I want to know? Who the FUCK is Tony Sinclair? Apparently he's some upper-class British socialite who likes swanning around in decadent parties that reek of Euro-glitz, flashing a smile with a gap in his teeth so big a bus could drive through the gap all honking and pulling a bunch of rusty bikes and on some of those bikes are overweight children too terrified to get off who are trying to dial the police one-handed.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
According to the WikiGods, Tony is actually Rodney Mason, who is Some Dude from Philly. I am not sure why Some Dude from Philly needs to put on tweed and waistcoats, dress up like Eddie Steeples with a rod up his ass, and sneer at me about gin. Whatever his intentions, I do not trust them. <br/>

      Yeah, I don't have a problem with their product (thought I do think Tanq 10 is overpriced), it's just that they had to make up a fake celebrity to sell it, like he's some sort of modern day Truman Capote. I don't like Shaq telling me what sort of drain cleaner or hemorrhoid medicine to buy, but inventing a famous person seems way more irritating. When I first saw those ads I thought, "Oh, I guess he's a fashion designer? Or something?" But no. It's just a complete crock of shit.

      Bombay Sapphire is nice, but it also has really, really awesome commercials. They must have production budgets miles high. The last one I saw was of some lavish tent out in the desert, and when they opened the bottle everyone in the tent started floating around and dancing with streamers flying through the air... <br/>

      Just bruise it to get the flavors into the drink, however that may be.  Maybe break it up with your hands before garnishing?  A tiny squirt of cucumber juice would be better, but you'd need a Jack Lalane number or a lack of other significant interests to do that. <br/>

      Well, I've been a Tanqueray loyalist forever -- it's in my blood (figuratively  <em>and</em>  literally!) -- but I have given every gin on the rack a thorough checking, by thorough I mean full dissemination of at least 3 bottles or a handle, whichever cheaper.

FYI, Gilbey's is $15 a handle and is actually good enough to make a martini with.  A shallow, uncomplicated martini, but a martini nonetheless.

      I am going to agree with the Hendricks recommendation.  It is awesome; subtle, powerful, fruity, spicy.  Everything you want in a gin.  It's one of my two favorite gins right now, with the Anchor Junipero.  That is made on a hill in San Francisco, by the dudes that make Anchor Steam Beer.  I am a huge fan of Anchor, because their rye whiskey (Old Potrero) is mind-blowing.  Better, albeit in a totally different way, than most single malt scotches.  Must be tried by anyone who likes whiskey. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But Hendricks is a major step up from Bombay.  And I got started on gin by drinking Bombay, so I appreciate the stuff.  Damn.  I am going to go buy some Hendricks now since I seem to be running low on gin.

      I have to have a variety of gin at hand for their myriad purposes and characters.  I have a handle of Tanqueray for martinis, a bottle of Beefeater for Tonics and birc-a-brac, a bottle of Gibley's for miscellaneous mixing purposes (such as a G&T for when I'm too drunk to notice the difference between Beefeater and Gibley's), a bottle of Rangpur, and two bottles of Hendricks, one in the cabinet and one in the freezer.

      I don't know about that, but I have a feeling that such a  thing would be a total mess in the Dead. Bands like The Fall and Swans pulled off the two drummers thing a decade and a half or so after Jerry and friends were en vogue, but those groups lend themselves to a full, lush sound, which is often more intense with the double-percussion. If the Grateful Dead had (or utilized more frequently) some chops, I could see them going amazing paces with those kinds of extra musicians...but they don't seem like a band that could pull it off, to me at least. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(If you're going to lame because I don't like the Dead, go ahead, but know that I was raised listening to them and have very valid reasons to dislike them. If you're offended, I'm sorry, but opinions do have a habit of causing distress, so.)

      Little Feat had a drummer -- Richie Hayward. They also had a percussionist Sam Clayton. In most concert gigs, Clayton played the bongos or a tympani-type thing It has another name, but it looks like an orchestral tympani. Jazz band use it). Of course, there was some overlap between the Dead and the Feat. If the Dead had a horn section, they'd sound a lot like the Feat. And the original Feat-guy himself, Lowell George (RIP) produced for the Dead.

      That kind of thing can be surprisingly hypnotic to watch, though.  I've seen bands with two drummers (Tortoise, select Pavement songs live, the Motown superband from  <em>Standing in the Shadows of Motown</em> ), often playing the same rhythm, or basically the same, and while it may seem musically pointless, it can be visually enticing.

      I'm cool with this kind of thing if the drummers play totally different fills, or have a different approach to how they play the same rhythm. Might sound ridiculous, but the casualness/intensity/training of a drummer can change the hell out of the sound...compare Buddy Rich and Ed Shaughnessy in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145937/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNhnioNNIPI&amp;feature=related">this drum battle.</a>  They play some similar bits but their approach to the instrument is totally different, particularly in their fills. It's damned fascinating, if I says so myself.

      It can sound great. If you double-track a drum beat it sounds bigger, and if the drums play different things sometimes and then come together at other points... It sounds fucking excellent. A good example of this is the band Black Eyes who had two drummers, and on their first album especially it is insanely good to hear. One drummer mixed to the right channel, the other drummer mixed to the left. AWESOME. <br/>

Having two drummers really isn't that uncommon. Modest Mouse do it now, too. Though they kind of suck now. But that's not the point.

      Not sure about that, but Boredoms had 77 drummers last year. Most notably, Andrew "Party" WK, and Brian Chippendale of Lightning Bolt fame. Search for 77boadrum on Youtube...there are some great examples of multi-drummer beats filling a space.

I feel like AWK can bring back some of the roughness that made early Lee Perry great...imagine some of his newer dance-style numbers with the gritty, buried-in-a-weed-field feel of Super Ape.

      Which reminds me. If Teodor's parents come from Belarus, then shouldn't his grandmother also? She wouldn't have that kind of control over the English language, right? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unless it's supposed to be translated - does Teodor speak Belarusian or Russian? Most of the children of immigrants that I know picked up the Russian language from their relatives. Have we ever seen him talk to Vlad?

      I don't think he does; as that strip says, they came over before he was born, so he's a US lifer.  Not saying he obviously couldn't have picked it up from his parents, but it's not like he grew up in the country or anything.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, as has been stated a few times (often by me), Vlad is most likely Polish (thought one time he is described just as "Slavic"), so even if T can speak Belorussian or Russian, he might not be able to converse with Vlad. <br/>

      I must say I'm shocked this strip is currently so close to four, culture-reference-that-I'm-not-familiar-with or otherwise. Panel four made me laugh long and hard, and is one of the finest things I've seen in a great while. And I thought panels five and six would be a nice gentle descent and landing after that hopspot of hilarity, but they maintained the strip's momentum and kept me deeply amused to the last word.

      Panel four is an accurate depiction of what it is like, trying to listen to the GD. Also, you can substitute plenty of modern Dead-inspired jam bands too, except instead of a lute, imagine a bongo drum or violin or some other instrument begging to not be overused by the members of Watermelon Follies or The Galactic Groove Experience whatever "wacky" name these sort of bands go by.

      Hey, <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Grateful Dead might not be everyone's cup of tea.  I can understand that.  But to be so casually dismissive reeks of the kind of new-school value-projection that makes my skin crawl.  Jerry and co. might have been a little repetitive, sure, but to focus on that is to ignore the groundbreaking developments they pioneered in studio recording (not to mention their status as, arguably, the "godfathers" of the entire late-eighties folk-metal movement). I think Robert Christgau put it best in his 1978 review of Marzipan Highway when he said "you gotta admire the chutzpah of these belly-dragging mandoliers -- they're at least willing to wear a smiley face as they put both fingers in the public eye (and one in the nose for the Nixon Network)."

      i suppose they deserve props, sure, but is it really unfair to dislike a band whose music you don't like? i see what you're saying, but typically the actual sound and pattern of the notes they choose to play is the main, un-overlook-able part of liking or not liking a band, not how they made the sounds and sounds fit on a record so nicely.

      In college I had a college radio station where I played indie rock of music by bands whose lead singers sounded like they had tuberculosis and would take requests from callers. There was this one guy who would call in and when I picked up the phone it was this operator chick going "This call is from Hampshire County Medium-Security Prison. Would you like to take a call from: 'HEY MAN, PLAY GRATEFUL DEAD!!'" and I had to be like 'Damn but we ain't got no Grateful Dead up in here, sorry dude.' <br/> 
 <br/> 
So the whole year, he would call every once in a while, requesting Grateful Dead and I had to go on the air and say 'Sorry to the caller who asked for Dead, we ain't got none,' and I always wondered what kind of crimes you had to commit to get into a  <em>medium</em> -security prison, and if that band he had chosen, 'Grateful Dead' was his way of crying out that he was looking forward to being executed for his crime. I ruminated on these ideas until finally, at the end of the school year, I decided to download a Grateful Dead song called "Ramble On Rose." I hoped the guy would call on my last show of the year but he didn't. I played it anyway and dedicated it to him and as I listened to it I realized a single truth of the universe, connecting all our wayward souls, all of us drifting in the ether, trying to find our original dongs but achieving minimal success, that one undeniable nugget of wisdom that was the cohesive force of the entire universe... <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was worst song. Played on ugliest guitar.

      What nobody has said -- most Dead songs are OK or even great in the studio version. But the jams that their fans obsessively recorded in concert carrying 30 pounds of gear and trading tapes like mad in the back classified of Relix Magazine -- that @%@$# is boring to anyone not a Deadhead. That's the difference between a fan (like me) and a Deadhead -- do you collect and spazz out on all the stoned concert tapes. BTW, the Dead section on YouTube is nearly all old concert footage (AFAICT).

      Ugh, Deadheads. I have never understood the concept of making a type of music, let alone a single band, be your entire persona. I like techno but I never went around with glow sticks and pacifiers. I like hip hop but don't walk around greeting people with gang signs and blaring my radio at 1000 so people can hear my bass (well, at least not when people can hear it.) <br/>

      One day in my former career, I heard a terrible sound drifting through the echoing expanse of the shop.

      You really thought you were the only person who hated them? Maybe we mix in different circles, but throughout my life they have been perhaps the most universally reviled band of all time. Everyone has their differences, but that has been the one commonly held belief between almost everyone I've ever talked music with.

      I understood the Dead to be wildly popular for decades.  Which they were.  But apparently also they have many virulent detractors.  I wouldn't put myself in that category, but I never could get too interested in their music.  Or the attendant fan culture. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, I'm not comfortable demeaning them as musicians.  They tapped into some of the same music that I really like.

      It is brilliant partly because in the first half of the strip, Roast Beef is warning Ray about why you should wash your hands when handling food, but it is Roast Beef who gets sick, and Ray yelling "I TOLD YOU!" This is exactly how the fine day would end for these two cartoon cats.

      I remember being 9 years old and thinking that the Grateful Dead had to be the greatest thing on wheels, while never having heard their music. The name, the lightning-skull logo, the mythos; how could they not just utterly destroy? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then my sister got a tape and started playing it every morning, and it sounded EXACTLY like panel four, except with flowers and sesame street thrown in. I was pretty disappointed, and I went back to listening to Quadrophenia and the New Jack City Soundtrack. <br/>

      Dude, don't I know it!  I was in a similar position of considering the aesthetics of The Dead to be extremely rad, but finding their music to be a bit of a letdown.  Not mindbendingly terrible, but kinda...meh.  At that point in my life I preferred my music to be very loud and weird. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another band who caught me off guard were Toad The Wet Sprocket.  I figured what with their homage to the excessively silly Monty Python skit that their music would be generally peculiar.  Instead, it was the aural equivalent of warm milk.  Boring, yet somehow gross at the same time.

      Pretty much everyone with any taste comes to the same conclusion eventually.  You'll hear deadheads complain about it, saying that that song was just their attempt to make a Top 40 record.  As if the band's sole attempt at craft or professionalism needs to be rejected outright.

      When you go to see Bob Dylan and there is this one dude who won't sit down, and insists on dancing through the whole show, and you don't get it, "Why won't that guy sit down?  What is he dancing to?", you will understand how I understand the Dead.  There is a source of energy.  Musicians are the conduit.  Music is the veneer.  Well, some musicians are anyway.  Jerry Garcia was one of the best conduits of all time.  You listen to some old recording.  It sounds like crap.  You say, "God, the Dead suck."  You are right.  You are standing on the floor at Winterland.  The Dead take the stage.  They fill the room with such tremendous energy that you dance your ass off all night long and get complements from girls who make their living as personal trainers, who you know but haven't seen for years, and neither of you recognize each other at first.  You remember that night for the rest of your life, and smile every time you hear the twang of Jerry's Strat.  You are wrong?  I don't think so. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's the energy.  Some musicians are better conduits than others, that's all.  Recordings are a lie.  You have to be there to feel the energy.  Some non-musicians are conduits too.  That is the only good of recordings - they allow non-musicians to transmit the energy.  Some.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is that clear?

      Nobody dances to Bob Dylan, okay? Nobody who has any fucking  <em>sense</em> , anyway.  <br/>

Look, I don't hate Dylan. I like some of his songs, I really do. But they are not danceable. I don't care about his conduit. You cannot dance to Bob Dylan, and if you do, you are a tool and pathetic specimen of personhood.

      I completely agree, but I have to say that if I had to dance to Dylan (gun-at-my-head sort of situation) I could probably shake it to "Jokerman." I'm not saying that it's anywhere near one of his crowning achievements, but I  <em>am</em>  saying that if you can't move your feet to some Sly and Robbie (who, oddly enough, hold down the rhythm section on that one song) you probably need a wheelchair.

      It's on  <em>Infidels,</em>  which came out in the early '80s. If that doesn't say enough to you already, let me warn you that it's not a good album. In fact, I would caution you against seeking it out. He was suffering from ridiculously full-blown and outspoken Christianity at the time,  <em>and</em>  it was the '80s, which never helps.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, for all of it's horrendous production, I do like that song.  <br/>

Oh, and I was mistaken; Sly and Robbie accompany throughout that album.

      Why is Dylan not on any of the best of 60s lists? At some times he would've been the first & only thing. Is it because his recent mass-exposure has made him less lovable by the hardcore, I wonder.

      Here's the thing about the Grateful Dead. I enjoy The Clash, but none of my clothes have steel studs or patches affixed with safety pins, and I don't think anyone would expect one to necessarily follow the other, at least not anymore. In the case of the Grateful Dead, though, the music is still obscured by the culture, and I think that's unfortunate. Their fans are/can be obnoxious, but they put out some pretty good music over the years. But I'll be the first to admit that some of their live stuff gets a bit tedious.

      It's the same with most fans of Ron Paul. I mean, I like Ron Paul, but I don't force-feed people my political opinions, and a lot of Paul supporters are basically waiting in the clock tower with sniper rifles to shoot you in the head with their bullets of opinion.

      Perhaps an explanation is in order! The game, such that it is, is Celebrity Chef : Famous Musician :: Culinary Accomplishments : Musical Accomplishments. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I started with Onstad's blog entry, likening Gordon Ramsay to Jimmy Page. But Gordon Ramsay cribbed most of his playbook from Marco Pierre White, much in the same way Jimmy Page borrowed Willie Dixon's "Bring It On Home". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd say that Thomas Keller compares well to Clapton, because they're both well-respected, virtuoso-level in their respective fields, but when was the last time you ever sat down and put on a Clapton album? Or do you know anyone who's actually eaten at The French Laundry? Onstad may have, along with some other Bay Area folks, but it's a bit of a (3,000 mile) drive for me.

I ate at the French Laundry once, several years ago, when I was a snotty-nosed 12 year old. My parents had brought my brother and I to the Russian River to sample Zinfandels (rather, they sampled. We stood around looking bored), and on the way back we stopped at the French Laundry. I was a picky eater, and had a burger. I'm not sure I had the full experience.

      This is the reason I give when people ask why they should observe  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145937/https://noshuffleday.com/">No Shuffle Day</a> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also like it because it makes me imagine my grandmother's face if she'd received this from me. I can see her opening the plastic pouch, the putrid mess lazily splashing on her non-slip loafer, the stench slowly rising to her sad, fundamentally disappointed face.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I miss her.

      grateful dead are simultaneously an easy target and an undeserving one i say, its like really crazy jazz (and a lot of other musics)in that its not bad its just freewheeling and spontaneous, theres alot of improv in both and sometimes they miss a beat but the special momements are very alive and organic, its an acquired taste, the types of people who indulge in such improvisational music are often really intense music fans (like myself) lookin for something different artistically thats gonna keep em guessing.  <br/> 
I had to say something as a devout deadhead and achehead. <br/>
