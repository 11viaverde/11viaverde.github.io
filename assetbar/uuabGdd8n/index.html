      I had a friend at work who at 6 o'clock every day would start going through, as he put it, "stripper withdrawl." <br/>

I got a text message from him on Christmas Eve when I was on the way to church with my family. He was on the way to XTC, which is the club past the county line that's conveniently placed next to a hotel.

      Clit Hero is nothing like the real thing.  Real clits are almost twice as big, and far more complex.  Playing Clit Hero all day might get your rhythm up to speed, but you'll never have decent fingering skill from it.  I suggest you go out and get your hands on the highest quality clit you can afford and strum away on it til your fingers bleed.

      I was thinking dinosaur but we don't really have a lot in the budget for costumes atm so just wing it and we'll see what happens. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Note: by wing it I mean break into the studio where they film Barney and steal the costume.  We need that fucking costume.  Get a baby bop for me while your at it. <br/>

This picture has a smiling Bill Frist on it, but instead of a body, his smiling face is framed by petals and a stem.  They will be growing out of terra cotta pots, and there will be large, Comic Sans letters at the bottom spelling "FRIST POTS!".  I will post this every day that I can, and you will all lame me until my nipples burst.

      Gogol was a Russian author, not a Ukranian author. Sorry about that! I had to correct you, because  <em>Dead Souls</em>  is one of my absolute favorite books of all time. Gogol is a genius, evinced by the fact that he wrote an entire story about a man who literally loses his nose ( <em>The Nose</em> , 1835) and made it work in a classy, elegant way. He also went insane, but we don't talk about that.

      *gets offended on behalf of his people but not really* Dude, WHAT are you talking about - Gogol is THE Ukranian national hero, born and raised. He wrote in Russian because that was the official language of the empire and was spoken from Poland to Alaska, and even still some of his writing is sprinkled with folksy Ukranian-ish expressions. It's kind of a sore point for Ukranians because to this day a huge portion of the country knows Russian, but not Ukranian (me being an example - we were taught it as a foreign language in elementary school, but I've forgotten everything). I mean, shit, we just had a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100110031559/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_revolution">revolution</a>  over this. Please don't take away our sole accomplishment besides  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100110031559/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salo_%28food%29">fried pork fat</a> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's okay, I'm not really offended. I mean, shit, I'm glad people are reading Gogol. Also, you were one of my favorite posters, where the hell have you been?

      Oh! Well, I'll be damned. That's really interesting. Almost the entirety of my experience with Gogol is in his connection to Russia and their literary heroes. That is, my general knowledge of Gogol as a historical anachronism is concentric to his friendship with Pushkin, his short experience as a "professor" of medieval history, and his harsh satire of the Russian provincial norms of the 1800s. Among other such Russian connections. I was viscerally aware of his Ukrainian heritage, but I was totally unaware of Ukraine's general claim to dibs on his literary heft. I have learned something today, achilleselbow. Thank you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also: thanks for the compliment! I've been absent because I've been incredibly busy. Last month was entirely eaten up by my AP tests (I took seven this year), student loan issues, and graduation. Also, recently, my time has been spent getting a summer job and all that "fun" stuff. I'm a lot less busy now, though, so I'll probably start posting regularly again. I wasn't aware that people actually noticed my posts all that much. I feel loved! Thank you, Assetbar. <br/>

      You might enjoy this band: <br/> 
Eugene Hutz is the charismatic frontman of Gogol Bordello, a multinational, multicultural explosion of a band whose new album is called Gypsy Punks: Underdog World Strike. The band mixes punk, ska, jazz, and the traditional Roma music of Ukraine, where Hutz grew up. Hutz and violinists Sergey Ryabtsev and Yury Lemeshev visit NPR's Studio 4A, where they perform a few songs and talk about their music. <br/>

      The Brittney blowback for that performance highlights layers upon layers of fucked-uppery this country has fallen into. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Layer 1: Who in their right mind would consider that body to be anything short of gorgeous?  I mean, maybe a Mercedes isn't as nice as a Lamborghini, but it's a whole hell of a lot better than my shitty compact truck. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Layer 2: How in God's name can a person become famous for the vocal/lyrical excrement that spews forth from her pouty, sexy lips? (I slip in and out of being nice/hateful towards Brittney) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Layer 3: In this country, you can be a slutty piece of trash that gets famous for being a slutty piece of trash. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Level 4: We're hyper-sexualizing kids to the point that they think that it's respectable to be a slutty piece of trash. <br/>

      So britney spears walks into a bar and a giant pair of scissors walks up to her and starts making fun of her and calling her a fat ugly bitch and britney starts to cry and then the scissors says "You should not have cried because my alien mission is to weed out the weak of the human race and collect their heads."  And with that, he swiftly cuts her head off with his sharpened blades, places it in a bag and walks towards the door.  "Before the night is over," he says "I will raze this city to the ground."  The bartender motions towards the headless corpse to his friend and says "I'd still hit that." <br/>

      Heccibiggs is sore that when I called her out on being an anti-catholic bigot, I would not accept that catholics "are stupid. <br/>

Specifically, she is referring to my point that calling catholics "stupid" if she is not going to engage with their beliefs and criticize them on their own terms, OR attempt to take political action against them because she believes that they harm others, is simply low abuse.

      I'm not sure what post of hers you're talking about, but I think the reason most people get sore at you from time to time is because you take comments that are obviously meant as jokes seriously and respond to them with pedantic rebuttals in the form of bland sarcasm.

      Actually, a butter face can do very well in stripping because the patrons are, in fact, looking at everything but her face. So, I don't think butter faces and Monets are a one to one relationship (and yes, I am the one being a dick about terms).

      God the British have a strange way of expressing themselves.  Like the one where you take a word that rhymes with the word you mean, but instead of saying the rhyming word, you say yet another word that is associated with it.  Like a thing I read in which a bad smell was called a "Dame Judi".  As in Judi Dench, because her surname rhymes with "stench".   Why do you guys do that?   <br/>

      There is also a smattering of rhyming slang in 'strine as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
China (plate = mate) <br/> 
Butchers (hook = look, also Captain Cook) <br/> 
Rubbity (dub = pup from the children's rhyme rubbity-dub three men in a tub) <br/> 
Plates (of meat = feet) <br/> 
Seppo (seppo is a shortening of septic tank = Yank, all Americans are called Yanks even if from the south) <br/> 
Tin Lids = Kids <br/> 
Burke (and Wills = Dills, a dill is a stupid person, Burke and Will are explorers who starved to death in the desert.) <br/> 
Reg Grundys = Undies, or underwear. Reg Grundy is an Australian television producer. <br/> 
Trouble and Strife = Wife <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is believed rhyming slang came to our shores with the convicts of the First Fleet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
How to say Melbourne: "Mel-bun" saying a long "bourne" will get you called a Seppo for sure.

Good point, although "the Sport" is the name of a newspaper, which is not a serious journal of sports and sportsmanship. But yes, we use "sport" as a kind of mass noun, I guess.

      It's been posited that the ryming slang of cockneyland was developed as a method of insuring the "old bill" didnt understand the various illegal schemes formulated by victorian wideboys, by speaking in a near incomprehensible and flexible dialect they could dicuss crimes within earshot of her majesties uniformed constabulary.

      'Tis rhyming slang for 'Gash'- which is either a crude way of saying that something is rubbish, or an even cruder way of referring to a lady's genitalia (apologies in advance). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Other indie-popstars names that are usefull for rhyming slang include Rick Whitter (formerly of Shed Seven- if that name means nothing to you then you should probably consider yourself lucky) and James Blunt. As in "I'm of to the Rick Whitter for an Eartha Kitt" and "James Blunt- what a James Blunt!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Other notable musical stars in this linguistic genre include Rolf Harris ("Rolf" being an onomatapaeic description of the act of vomiting), Thom Yorke (to "pork"), Robert Coltrane, Pink Floyd, Super Furry Animals, Johnny Flynn, Modest Mouse, and if you believe more than half of this crap I would like to be the first to welcome you to the Assetbar Gullible Posters' Club!

      To be honest, most of my experiences with strippers have been either horrible or soul-crushing. The most memorable one was one that looked cute in shadows or flashing lights, but then when she was right on top of a gent you tended to notice the lazy eye and titties like empty plastic grocery bags that  <em>rolled up as though window shades in cartoons when she rubbed her front on your body</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also she had a limp.  <br/>

      The heartbreaker for me was the 18 year old stripper with the plastic-grocery-store boobs.  It was like when you were young, and had a helium balloon.  It was neat, and full, then after a week it deflated and got wrinkly in all the old bulgy parts.  Those were her boobs.  And a pretty good metaphor for her life.  It made me really appreciate the full, bouncy boobs I stole from somebody this weekend.

      The unfortunately-boobed 18 year old was as such because she had recently had her second child.  She told us all about it.  By us, I mean me, because I was the sober guy not getting lap-polish and she knew I wasn't going to punch her and run out. <br/>

      All of my sober experiences with strippers have been pretty horrific.  It's the sort of thing that shouldn't be done sober. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Drunk, I tend to focus on staring at those ladyparts that I like and laughing a lot while telling lies to naked women sitting on my lap.  When sober, I try to start discussions about politics, and end up telling them that I can't give them free legal advice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is so good that you can't serve alcohol at strip clubs.  I would be so broke if they did.

      I think this might be the kind of thing that varies by state? Around here, I believe the law is that if it's full nudity, then no alcohol, but if it's only topless, then alcohol is allowed. I guess they're afraid that the sight of an open vagina will automatically drive a drunk man to attempt rape. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, my best/worst experience was as follows: Me and a friend had tagged along with some other friends to a Coheed and Cambria show in Wilkes-Barre, PA - one of those former manufacturing towns that was now a sad and shady place. They had tickets and we thought we could just get them at the door, but it was sold out. Having nothing to do, we saw that next door to the cafe there was a strip bar called Toppers. We weren't really the strip club-frequenting types, but it was kind of raining, so we figured 'what the hell' and went in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Inside, it was like a scene from the Star Wars Cantina. All sorts of rough-and-tumble blue-collar types watching white trash girls with bad teeth and stretch marks wobble drunkenly on a makeshift runway behind the bar. Next to the bar, another girl was dancing while an extremely old man in suspenders and a baseball cap who looked like someone from a lung cancer infomercial was cheerfully gyrating in front of her. The girl seemed both pleased and amused by this.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
We had just sat down at the bar when the bartender asked for our ID's. Having already gotten a feel for what sort of place this was, I nonchalantly handed her my regular ID, which clearly said I was 19. She paused and looked at me for a second, then handed it back to me while mumbling "okay, you just...hold on to that." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The rest of the night was a bit of a blur. Some of the girls were actually decent looking (at least after a couple of Smirnoff Ices) and I ended up getting a $5 lap dance where the girl nearly fell on the floor several times. Needless to say, by the time the show ended and our friends called to see where the hell we were, we had forgotten all about Coheed and Cambria, whose second album wasn't that great anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The following year, we went to another show at Cafe Metropolis and decided to check out Toppers afterwards. Instead, we were instead met with an empty storefront, and a homeless man loitering nearby confirmed what we already feared - it had burned down.

      General regional vibe I've observed. <br/> 
So.Cal.-  Fun if you're slightly tipsy and leave fast so as to not spend too much.  Some very hot and naked girl will probably try to sell you real estate. <br/> 
No.Cal.-  It feels sleazier in strip clubs up there.  You know you're oppressing the working class. <br/> 
Vegas-  Like most things in Vegas, it's ironic and kitschy for about 5 minutes, then it just makes you want to die.  I always wonder how everywhere you go in Vegas can be filled with wannabe-gangster jackasses.  They must have capacity problems in the county jail. <br/> 
The rest of Nevada-  Sounds like Wilkes-Barre. <br/> 
Vancouver, BC-  That was fun, but it was in the days of favorable exchange rates. <br/> 
Utah-  It's ever so much fun when you know how much you're sinning. <br/> 
Arizona-  I know people who say the clubs there are great but it just feels like a dirtier, cheaper, sweatier version of Vegas without gambling to me.

      My best/worst experience was my bewildering first experience.  A couple friends and I were stumbling down Freemont Street in Vegas at 3 AM (we were just 21 so this was well before they closed off Freemont to turn it into some sort of open-air gambing mall).  Various semi-attractive women from the slot joints were trying to lure us in with coupon books for free pulls and 49 cent margaritas.  In front of Girls of Glitter Gulch, which with all the neon looked like any other casino, two women put admission cards into our drunken fingers and steered us into their storefront.  It wasn't til passing he doorman that my eyes adjusted and I realized, "Hey, this isn't a casino.  It's full of naked ladies!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
None of us had been in a topless bar before, but we were very much in the mode of, "OK, so this is what is happening now," so we let the hostess put us at a table in the back with its own little pole.  We ordered our mandatory drinks and started exercising our necks seeing how reality measured up to the movies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then the women started coming by to sit and chat with us.  We didn't know that a strip club was a place where customers and employees all play "let's pretend this is normal" so I'm sure we looked adorable with our jaws hanging open trying to make conversation with a gorgeous woman in her underwear while other strange women danced around us half-naked.  Of course, we were soon asked if we would like a table dance.  (I don't know if this place didn't have lap dances at the time, or if we just looked like one would likely kill us, but one was never offered.)  After one of us said something along the lines of, "Why, yes, miss, that sounds lovely," the lady climbed up on the table and stripped as she danced around the pole.  (to  <em>Right Said Fred</em>  "I'm Too Sexy", still burned into my consciousness) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even though we were all three blasted, this was incredibly awkward.  My brain probably sounded like Roast Beef...  <em>Oh my gosh her naked boobs are like three feet from me I shouldn't be staring at those that is totally rude I need to look her in the eye no wait it must be totally rude not to look at her boobs I mean isn't that what she is going for?</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had finally started to get into the groove of the place when one of the dancers did something to totally break my cool.  She stopped dancing, stuck out her ass, and slapped it with her hand.  Then she just stared at me!  I had no idea what the appropriate reaction was.  Woo-hoo?  Should I let out a little "woo-hoo"?.  Raised eyebrow and knowing nod?  Golf clap?  I just stared as she resumed dancing, then I looked across the table at my friends and saw them looking back at me with the same look of confusion I had.  "What the hell was that?  Was that supposed to be sexy?"  A few seocnds later the dancer stops and does the ass-slap again, aiming it at one of my friends.  Now I look over at him and see a look of fear in his eyes as she stares him down.  I look over at my other friend and we both have to bite our tongues to keep from busting out laughing.  No.  Do not laugh at the Vegas strippers.  But this lady wouldn't stop with the ass-slaps!  It was like a game of Russian roulette.  We're all exchanging red-faced grins around the table as she dances and then... Stop.  Slap!  Staaaaare!  Whoever she was staring at had to try to keep a straight face while the other two bit our tongues and bobbed our heads trying to be quiet while drinking in the thrid's discomfort.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That was the longest table dance I have ever experienced at a strip club.  No one broke, and the dancer was paid and moved on so we could huddle and share our bewilderment.  Later on I would be in a lot more clubs and see other strippers unique moves and combos and it would all seem more normal.  But that was a strange introduction to the surreal world of strip clubs.

      I know I am responding to an old post, but I just need to let this guy know. If they put you in a semi-private room with a pole and only a few chairs, you are not in a strip club, that was a thinly disguised brothel. You went to a brothel.

      Oh, this was just a strip club.  It was not the situation in  <em>Go</em>  where we were off in a back room somewhere.  We were in the main room with a couple long stages, just at our own booth along the back wall. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Girls of Glitter Gulch" is still right there on Freemont Street last time I noticed.  Although I would not recommend it to anyone.  Last time I went in there, many years ago, the classy veneer had been... gone... and it had become a depressing assembly line for the girls to separate tourists from their money.

      Where I live they get around this by having a liquor store you can walk through the club to get to.  God I love my town. <br/>

Strip clubs are hella depressing, to be sure.  More the people who go there than ladies.  The ladies I have met were all pretty much down to earth, if not the most beautiful women.

      There were a couple of strip clubs in my area who tried an interesting dodge.  Thanks to restrictive laws, even juice bars around here can't go for full nudity, limited to the g-string.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But a 'cultural event' put on in a 'theatre venue' had no such restrictions.  Two different places suddenly called themselves  <em>theatres</em> , arranged  <em>show times</em> , and called their strippers  <em>perfomance artists</em>  - happily stripping to their birthday suits for the two years it took to work its way through the courts and legislature. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To my mind, the best part of the whole thing was watching local news interviews of sleazy strip joint managers talk about the 'art' they were providing to the community.

      My cars window is broken.  As such, when it rains, my "shotgun" seat gets wet.  Today however, was gorgeous out.  As such, after taking 2 exams, I decided to throw my junk into the car, and go get some food with a friend.  At first, I kept my laptop in the back, but when the papers on my front seat started flying around, I hefted my laptop, and placed it atop the papers like a mutli-thousand dollar paper weight. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After I left to go get a sandwich (sunny-side up egg, chicken cutlet, hash brown, russian dressing... it is god.) I noticed it was raining quite hard.  I only remembered my laptop.  Wearing my snazzy new glasses, I stared through the window.  The topside of my computer was COVERED in water.  I was in horrid dismay, and one of the first thoughts that ran through my head was... "HOW WILL I CHECK ACHEWOOD!?" <br/>

I need to check the obscurity/acceptability chart to see where  <em>Bachelor Party</em>  falls. Are 80's hooker /pimping based comedies still in vogue? For all the young ones out there, off the top of my pointed head  <strong>a list</strong> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Bachelor Party, 1984 </em>  Tom Hanks career highlight <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Doctor Detroit, 1983</em>  Worst Movie Never Seen? <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Night Shift, 1982</em>  Micheal Keaton and Henry Winkler! <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Risky Business, 1983</em>  Guido the Killer Pimp  <em>is</em>  Joey Pants! <br/>

      Have we ever seen much interaction between Lyle and Beef? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can't seem to recall any.  I'd be interested to see how the two would interact.  Lyle's so in-your-face and lacking any subtlety at all, and I don't know how Beef would react to it.  It's interesting how some friends in a group just never really talk or hang out together except as part of the larger group - and even then, never really talking to each other. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know Ray is Beef's opposite, too - but dude, it's  <em>Ray.</em>

      Well, this assumes that other people will pay money to watch a naked girl on a riding mower mow their lawn. This is a pretty safe assumption. Unfortunately, most men who have lawns also have wives, which may prove to be an obstacle.

      I don't know why, but I immediately thought of the post-op transexuals Lyle was employed to make feel comfortable. Sure as hell would make Beef grateful for getting married. <br/>

      Yo, there's plenty of hot transfolk. Believe it or not, they get laid all the time. And married, even!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But maybe you are saying that Beef would be grateful for getting married if he saw how functional and cute Thomas Beatie's marriage is and realized that marriage can bring two people together in a really beautiful way regardless of their gender. In that case, I would agree with you.

      Well, that's only if they are oriented in such a way as to not care about gender or to prefer both. I think he was saying that Beef would be grateful for being married because it meant avoiding the risk of having a hot catgirl turn out to be a catdude. I mean I don't think it's prejudiced at all to say that as a straight dude, I find the idea of boning a chick who used to be a dude hella gross, though I certainly don't begrudge other people the right to do so.

      Yeah, see, I think that is weird. I don't understand why you would think it is gross to have sex with a hot woman just because she used to have a penis but doesn't have one anymore. I mean, she's a woman now. It is just a thing I don't understand.  <br/>

      The trick to traps is that they are not hot women.  It is okay to be attracted to a dressed, pretty tranimal.  When you see one naked, she is clearly not a woman.  Surgery can only go so far.  A man not wanting to press his business into the ruined junk of another person is reasonable.  If some chick gets herself changed into a dude, and you are attracted to that dude, this is awesome.  It is also okay if you don't want that transexual dude to put his plastic fake dong into you. <br/>

      I think that you base your sexuality much more on genitalia and much less on personality than I do. The phrase "ruined junk" is pretty offensive to me, but I think I lost all my feminist cred near the top of this page, so I guess I will not say anything more about it.

      Is it? From what I hear, most straight girls think penises are kinda funny-looking. In fact, a bunch of British girls in heccibiggs' kitchen vociferously disagreed with me when I said otherwise. I think attraction has more to do with the performance of gender than with actual, physical genitalia (and more to do with personality than with performance of gender). I would never stop sleeping with a guy because he had a small dick, for example, and if I closed my eyes, I would not be able to tell the difference between a real dong and a fake plastic dong during sex.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe there is no such thing as a tranny who is the same as a woman during bonetime, but I don't see how that means their junk is "ruined." It just means it's different. But so what? You don't fuck someone just because of their gender, or you'd want to fuck every single girl in the world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I found that "ruined" part offensive, but I don't think I made any judgments about superiority or open-mindedness or normality, did I? I'm not going to come to your house and point a gun at your head until you fuck a transperson.

      I will comment on three parts.  First, penises are funny-looking.  They are designed by a drunk person.  Vaginas aren't much better.  Both smell weird and give off unpleasant tastes.  A person's business district is not designed for aesthetics. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Second, if I had any ability to stand 'whatwhat' style  sex, trannies would be awesome.  'backofaVolkswagon' boning would be EXACTLY the same, and traps would be absolutely functional.  Unfortunately, I can only giggle at that act, it does not give me a radish, I am not theirateturk. <br/>

Third, if I had known earlier that you don't mind men with small dangles, I would have totally made my move on you.  My deal is tiny, and shaped like a car.

Well, consider it this way: biological gender (genitalia included) is a necessary but not sufficient condition. So it forms the basis for the more specific criteria one applies to biological females, which in my case would be that they be missing no more than two limbs and have most of their facial features intact and in roughly the right places.

      Well if there's anything I've learned in all my processing of theory drivel, it's that there are so many different strains of feminism which disagree on so many fundamental things that any blanket judgment about feminism reveals more about the speaker's own prejudices than the subject at hand. Of course, this also means that it's also pretty useless to identify as a feminist unless you're willing to put a few prefixes in front of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The thing is that we weren't talking about how one treats people in society, but how one views them sexually. So while it is both necessary and good that we don't filter the first thing through the gender lens and treat everyone equally in that sense, approaching sexuality the same way is neither conceivable nor desirable for the majority of people. The problem is that since Freud a lot of (not all!) gender theorists have run away with this idea that sexuality is the basis for everything in life and thus the project of human liberation must start with tearing down all gender norms. I would instead suggest that we limit our gender norms to our sexuality and just not extend them beyond deciding who we personally want to fuck. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So anyway, I can see that "ruined" is offensive because it carries a negative value judgment, but from the standpoint of a straight guy it is technically "ruined" in the sense of "modified so as to be no longer desirable to me". So I guess "modified junk" would be a more acceptable phrase. It just doesn't have the same ring to it though.

      I would suggest it is totally fucking  <em>impossible</em>  to limit our gender norms to our sexuality. I would also suggest that everyone sees things through a gendered lens all the time, but that men don't notice it as much as women do, because men are considered to be the default gender. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, this thread is wildly derailing, but that last comment was not meant to criticize you. It was meant to criticize a thing that people say to me on the Internet often that I think is stupid because the same people who say it to me think they are free of gender bias, and they're not. It really had little to do with the topic at hand, I guess. I just thought your view about transfolk is probably pretty widely held, and that it made a good example of a widespread gendered lens. <br/>

      I guess the use of ruined in that way is acceptable since it's just an opinion, but it's horribly offensive. I mean it's not like you've painted your guitar and your friend says it's ruined now, it's something deeply personal and important to someone.

      I think that achillesbow is trying to defend his aversion to having sex with a transgendered person, which is totally acceptable. It would be like a gay person defending their aversion to heterosexual sex. It is just not their preference. There are plenty of people who feel differently than him though, so it works out for everyone! What are we arguing about? Everyone dance! Have a couple of glasses of wine. It's on me! Genetalia are gross, but we are all going home tonight from this party and we are going to enjoy the fuck out of them.

      I also found the "ruined" part offensive. However I recognise it is hedonismbot's raison d'etre too be offensive for no reason, so I won't hold it against him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
   If someone identifies as a woman or a man because that is how they see themselves then that is all that counts. You either find someone a valid sexual partner or not. You should treat each individual with the respect a human being deserves, until they prove themselves a fuckwit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
   One of my friends one started a bar brawl because he took exception to a friend of his being identified as a man when she identifies as a woman (pre-op and she prefers to be a pre-op). (I was on my honeymoon at the time so I heard about it second hand and didn't have to put myself in danger,  <em>I'm a wuss</em> .) <br/> 
 <br/> 
   Gender is hella flexible. I mean a woman is a woman is a woman, no matter what they started as. My friend's friend attracts a lot of "straight" guys who nonetheless like to suck cock and be penetrated. These are guys who couldn't be with another guy for whatever reason, but because she identifies as a woman, they can do what they want to do and feel okay about it. Its nice to know there is someone for everyone isn't it?

 <br/> 
 <strong>Transgendered</strong>   <br/> 
-A person who%u2019s gender differs from the gender assigned to them at birth on the basis of their genetic and/or physical sex.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Transgendered vs. Transsexual</strong>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Transgender and Transsexual are not always one in the same. The trick to remembering is in the words. TransGENDER TransSEXUAL  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Transsexuals are transgendered people who are changing/have changed their physical anatomy.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
-Considered a relative term  <br/> 
%u2013Does it include hormones? Breast enhancement/reduction? Just genital surgery?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Non-op transsexuals  <br/> 
 <br/> 
%u2013Take hormones  <br/> 
%u2013Have %u2018Top Surgery%u2019  <br/> 
%u2013Or both  <br/> 
A person can go through any or all stages of physical transition and still identify as transgendered  <br/> 
 <br/> 
My friend's friend has breasts and has experimented with hormone treatments, making her transexual, however she still has a penis, I used the phrase pre-op to distiguish this from full gender re-assignment surgery, the mistake is mine I should have said non-op but I thought more people would understand pre-op rather than non-op. It is not something she says about herself. I am serious about this subject as I have a small number of gay friends and I have friends of friends who are transgendered. They do not have the easiest time just being true to themselves, so I will try to educate the ignorance wherever I see it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
P.S. Its been donkeys since I went to Uni. (Donkeys Ears = Years)

      One thing that I would point out is that your argument is also serious and collegiate in nature - it's just not a popular viewpoint, and even then if you didn't dismiss academia with a broad brush you'd find that it's been discussed. For example, in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100110031559/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Trouble">Gender Trouble</a>  Judith Butler concedes that the DSM diagnosis of transgendered people as having a disorder is beneficial in some ways because it helps them actually get the treatment (including surgery) that they need. And the reason that the extreme fringes get so much attention is because they at least call into question the universality of our gender categories simply by existing, whether you like it or not. In any field, fringe cases are always the most interesting ones. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, I actually feel where you're coming from since I'm generally opposed to the kind of knee-jerk PC attitude that dominates the Left and think pride parades are stupid and pointless, etc. On the other hand, it's helped me hone my views and arguments beyond the equally typical knee-jerk reactionary attitude that most people who criticize "political correctness" exhibit. So you might want to be a bit more careful with your arguments. For example, why not "defend an individual's right to believe that they were born the opposite gender of what they feel they should be"? First of all, people certainly have the right to believe whatever they want. Secondly, doctors and psychologists are generally in agreement that this is a real disorder that people have, for whatever reason. If the person has actually weighed the decision (along with the knowledge that a lot of potential partners will be turned off by them) and still decided that the operation would make them happier than living in a gender they don't feel comfortable in, then by all means they should be allowed to have one (and currently the operations require extensive psychiatric evaluation). The other thing is that you can't separate 'altering sexuality' from 'practicing sexuality' because the whole point of the alteration is to allow them to practice the kind of sexuality they want. I imagine that if you asked a male-to-female transsexual why they can't just be gay instead, they'd tell you that they're actually uncomfortable in a male body and don't like having a penis, etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Where I would agree with you is that tolerance of transgendered people and thinking they should have full rights under the law shouldn't obscure the fact that it is after all a disorder. But so what? Certainly you wouldn't say they be stigmatized or ostracized for having it, and if they want to form a whole little culture around it, I couldn't care less. The only way in which it could potentially affect people like you and me is in the hypothetical situation of boning a chick who used to be a dude, and we already agreed above that personally being sexually repulsed by modified junk doesn't make you a bigot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So basically I'm not sure what your problem is. Gender dysphoria is already a psychological diagnosis and therapy is required before any operation (and recommended in all cases anyway). Would you actually go so far as to argue that therapy or "supervision" should be forced on people who otherwise pose no immediate danger? I don't think you would.

      Here is what I think randombeing's problem may be: He is wondering for what reason the particulars of "trans-whatever" people are thought to have Wider Implications for people who aren't personally afflicted or close to someone who is.  One is probably not supposed to say "afflicted," sorry.  For a long time my impression of people who advocate that trans issues are important to everyone else is that they would like everyone else to admit to being just as confused as the "trannies."  I don't think that's true.  But, if it's just another mental health problem, then it doesn't make a good political football / discussion topic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That being said, randombeing may choose to clarify, and also I don't mind what you discuss, I can skip past easily enough if I'm not interested.

      Transgenderism  <em>does</em>  have Wider Implications, though. The implications aren't that everyone is confused. At the most basic level is an implication that we need to chill out and be tolerant of differences, even if those differences freak us out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One step higher is the implication that gender is largely a social performance and so we should relax about gender norms. As a woman, most of my gender norms suck, and I'd like to be able to transgress them without getting socially ostracized. Men have some sucky gender norms, too, that I'm sure they'd be able to like to reject. It is in our interest to foster social acceptance for transfolk, because it means that we have more personal freedom. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On a more theoretical level, the visceral disgust toward transfolk from even otherwise liberal and open-minded people seems to indicate an investment in patriarchal power structures. Men seem to be generally more creeped out by male-to-female trannies than female-to-male, and more creeped out by gay male sex than gay female sex. That kind of seems like the result of unconscious misogyny; it is abhorrent to imagine a male in a female role because females are supposed to be the second-class ones, not males. If we can help get rid of that disgust, we can help get rid of misogyny and patriarchy. (I don't expect many of you to buy this one, but I did preface it by saying it was theoretical.) <br/>

      Beyond your first paragraph, I think reasonable people may disgree as to the extent to which any of that is true.  I have no doubt that many people, certainly your professors included, believe it deeply, but they are hard ideas to "prove." <br/>

      Since this is the undying thread of the day... boob jobs.  Boob jobs are nasty and gross.  For a lot people, just the thought of basically mutilating your body  <em>for the purpose of pretending to be something you're not</em>  is abhorrent. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also.  Straight dudes like vaginas sexually.  They do not like penises sexually.  Seems pretty obvious to me why lesbianism is considered erotic by most men, while two dicks dicking around would be "gross" or unarrousing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That being said, we should all be more tolerant.  That includes being tolerant of the multitude of sexual orientations including transsexuals, straights, etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Why make such a big fuss about things when the underlying issue is that everyone should respect each other and keep their nose in their own business!

      <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>On a more theoretical level, the visceral disgust toward transfolk from even otherwise liberal and open-minded people seems to indicate an investment in patriarchal power structures. Men seem to be generally more creeped out by male-to-female trannies than female-to-male, and more creeped out by gay male sex than gay female sex. That kind of seems like the result of unconscious misogyny; it is abhorrent to imagine a male in a female role because females are supposed to be the second-class ones, not males. If we can help get rid of that disgust, we can help get rid of misogyny and patriarchy.</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
See, this is where I think the problem starts. Irondave and Cromar are right - straight dudes like vaginas and not penises, chicks and not dudes. It really is that simple. With male-to-female trannies there's an additional element of disgust based on deception or cognitive dissonance because you could be initially attracted to a woman and then realize she has modified junk and is/used to be a dude. Case closed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is also precisely what I was talking about before when I tried to differentiate personal subjective disgust from wider social belief. The reason the left and feminists disgust so many people is because they try to go beyond achieving social and legal justice to actually prying into people's private emotions and trying to change them (this is where all the ___phobic crap comes in), which is bullshit. I will easily stand up for the right of trannies, gay people, and so forth to enjoy full legal rights and not to be attacked or harassed in any way, but I will also defend to the death my right to be personally disgusted by the idea of them rather than think "how great and liberating!" and even to make jokes based on this disgust with other like-minded people. I'll admit that most people have trouble separating the two and make claims to how things 'should' be based on nothing more than personal disgust, so I can see why activists would try to conflate the two, but it's a losing strategy. It's much easier to accept the ideals of constitutional democracy and "live and let live" rather than the idea that trannies are awesome and we should all get rid of our oppressive gender norms. I don't generally enjoy South Park, but this is indeed the difference between "tolerance" and "acceptance". <br/> 
 <br/> 
The other thing I would note is that the existence of gender norms is what makes our individual subversions of them meaningful and gives them character. I enjoy the fact that I know jack shit about sports and order coconut mojitos at the bar, just as I'm sure you enjoy the fact that you make dirtier 'your mom' jokes than most guys I know. None of these would be that cool without reference to the entrenched gender norm that they are subverting. On the other hand, like pogo, I enjoy being a straight man and don't feel particularly restricted. I also enjoy the fact that all of my close friends are straight and that we can talk about girls and make jokes about trannies amongst ourselves without having to worry about anyone being offended. Which is why norms aren't all bad, since they provide social cohesion.

      Hmm. The cognitive dissonance thing is something I hadn't considered, I guess, and that's a fair point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I disagree with you that "_____phobic" terms are crap. I also wouldn't say that feminists want to pry into people's personal thoughts, but rather that they would like to persuade people to see their point of view, which they believe is right. Most people want to persuade other people to see their point of view. I do not want to  <em>force</em>  you into thinking trannies are awesome, but, yes, I'd like to argue that trannies are awesome and persuade you if I can. I also try to persuade people into liking Achewood. If you're unconvinced, you're unconvinced, but it's fine if I make my case, isn't it? <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I think maybe your disagreement with me about gender norms might have to do with semantics. I don't have problems with the ideas of masculinity and femininity, per se, I have a problem with being socially punished for stepping out of those gender norms. I am all for subverting them like you've laid out. I just want that to be more socially acceptable.

      Yea but if it was completely socially acceptable, wouldn't it cease to be subversion? Where we're at now, it's still seen as mildly subversive, but I haven't really suffered any consequences because of it. Have you really been socially punished for transgressing gender norms?

      That's a good point about complete social acceptability, and I agree with it. But yes, I have definitely been socially punished for transgressing gender norms. Every time I say I don't want to have kids, I'm completely dismissed and told I'll change my  mind. Whenever I got punished for cussing at school or at home, I was told to act more ladylike. I got better grades than all the boys in my high school, but once a guy told me I wasn't that smart and he could get my grades if he tried harder, which he never said to any of the guys whose were doing almost as well as I was. People are okay with it when I make graphic sex jokes, but they're not okay with it when I get outspoken or smart or not docile. Even just now, you perceived me as wanting to pry into your private emotions. That might have been entirely my fault in expressing myself imperfectly, but it also might also have had something to do with you not being used to women being all argumentative. (I am not saying that I am free of socially transmitted gender stereotypes and you are not. I am not saying that at all.)

Also, the not having kids thing isn't only applied to women - I've gotten the same reactions too. As for the other stuff you mention, well, I agree that sucks. I don't think you'll encounter it much anymore in the kind of social milieu you're likely to find yourself in at Stanford and beyond.

      At Carnegie Mellon, which has a 3:2 male-to-female ratio, I encountered the most rampant sexism I'd ever seen. And much of it's kidding "on the square," but it's pretty darn easy to see who's going for a funny joke and who brings something up because of the grain of truth they believe there is to it.

      I think you've just proven randombeing's point. The treatment of transness is highly politicised, and I wonder how many people with gender dysphoria feel that they are not allowed to want to be reconciled to their birth gender, or to construct an identity out of the trans mainstream - almost like a fixed gender role had been constructed for them, with the additional twist that it has been sanctioned as objective by medicine.

      "cut themselves in ways that'll make them useless to just about everybody"? What? Look, you can think what you want about transfolk, and as we established above you are in no way required to be attracted to them, but "useless to just about everybody"?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The last time I checked, people's personal worth isn't based on how "useful" they are, and if it were, I would think it would have much more to do with how they acted in society than with the particulars of their junk. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also don't understand at all why defending fringy folk automatically means you can't be deadly serious. There aren't that many Bahais in the world, but you'd still defend them from the religious persecution they're receiving in Iran, wouldn't you?

      I think you know what randombeing meant by "just about useless" and it's a fair point that as trans advocacy solidifies a trans gender and social role, it may make it harder for people with genuine gender dysphoria (as opposed to those who want to take on a third gender role and identity) to accept that it may be the best option to mostly stay within the norms accepted for their gender (after all most bio-dudes have no chance of resembling a bio-woman convincingly). It's like being sexually attracted to lapsang souchong - most shops just don't carry it because almost no-one likes it that much.

      I certainly agree that all sorts of psychological things should be tried before anyone has their junk operated on.  It also worth noting that there are plenty of quacks and charlatans in medicine and psych who go along with whatever a patient wishes.  I expect many of these issues are harder to deal with when one is young and seem much clearer with the prespective of age.  My advice, get over yourself and use what God have you for love and joy, reproducing if you can.

      Okay, but what if God gave you a female identity and male genitalia? You should try to use psychological things to change your  <em>identity</em>  rather than your  <em>genitalia</em> ? One seems a lot easier to change than the other. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Getting gender reassignment surgery isn't something you just do on a whim one day. You have to get it approved by more than one psychologist, and you have to live as your desired gender (with the help of hormones, etc.) for a year before you can get the surgery.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Meanwhile Jocelyn what'shername up there gets to turn herself into a cat without any psychological therapy at all. Do I think that's weird? Uh, yeah. Do I think she should be allowed to get whatever surgery she wants? Yes. It's her fucking body. And if she can modify her body to look more like an animal, then people should certainly be allowed to modify their bodies to bring them into harmony with their gender identities. Identities are so much more important than bodies.

      It becomes a pretty prominent one when your gender is out of sync with your biological sex, doesn't it? <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is easy to ignore the ramifications of gender on your identity if you're cisgendered, especially if you're a cisgendered man, but when society constantly treats you worse because of your gender, it becomes something you identify with more strongly.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think gender is  <em>the</em>  primary component of identity, but I definitely think it's  <em>a</em>  primary component of identity.

I agree it's not, but think about the world we grow up in. In English there are only two other groups aside from the vague 'them' 'us' and 'me' and that's 'him' and 'her', 'he' and 'she'. In many other languages people even have 'male' and 'female' objects. Almost everyone is stereotyped and treated according to their gender when they're growing up and all through their life, and I think this has a much bigger and more noticable effect on your whole identity when you fall outside of the expectations placed on you by society because of your body.

      Well I suppose logically it doesn't make much sense, but then again, wanting to stick an elongated body part into another person's orifice on the basis that they smell nice and have pronounced bulges on their chest isn't really that logical either, if you think about it.

      Your comment, achillesbow, is evocative.  I agree, I don't want to date a former man.  Still, I can't help feeling hellof sympathy for a man who feels like a woman in the "wrong clothes."  And admiration for their courage in pulling the trigger.  Still don't want to date them.  I guess "ruined junk" pretty much sums it up.  Hells! <br/>

In the future you will be able to be any sex you want to be.  You will be able to change your body from man to woman and back again.  It takes about 8 weeks.  No one will have ruined junk.

      The Ghost of Jacob Marley <br/> 
 <br/> 
"The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, <br/> 
usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on <br/> 
the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, <br/> 
and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was <br/> 
clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound <br/> 
about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge <br/> 
observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, <br/> 
ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. <br/> 
His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing <br/> 
him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see <br/> 
the two buttons on his coat behind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no <br/> 
bowels, but he had never believed it until now." <br/>

      lately there has been a lot of character development in Achewood to the point where Achewood is starting to resemble [url]DinosaurComics.com[/url].  Some days reading the comic feels like as if I am reading the blogs.  The greeting cards also... some of those comics have been a lot of prose with not so much action.  The dialogue balloons in a comic are really better, aren't they, when they are more some sort of  form of verse than of prose?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It just seems like lately, Chris is getting caught up in the character development so much that the pace of the story is kind of grinding to a halt sometimes, and the scenery is kind of becoming stagnant sometimes.  Whatever happened to the exploration, for example, of that juxtaposition of the fantasy and real worlds?  Now Beef is just hopping on a plane like just another human.  [url="https://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Mouse-and-the-Motorcycle/Beverly-Cleary/e/9780380709243/?itm=1"]Motorcycle Ralph[/url] is dead? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also there was that one comic with the flight stewardess...  just the image of her was so horrid.  And of course Onstad has to draw no less than four panels of her, each panel spaced a fraction of a second apart from the previous one, thus forcing a sort of three dimensional quality about her into the mind's eye of the reader, making that horid character all the more alive.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I, a casual reader, am still having nightmares about her, then what suppressed madness has she induced in Beef?  How did Beef ever find her attractive in the first place?  I don't care what drugs he was on, it just doesn't explain it.  Is that really what Achewood women look like?  That can't be.  That is some kind of flim-noire science fiction horror plot when a that thing is remotely near the standard of what is attractive, even for a drunk cat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not bitching.  I'm just sharing my thoughts.  Maybe I'm being critical but this is still the best comic strip out there, I think.

      I always find an Achewood funnier when it's been given a chance to "age". When I go back through the archives, a strip that wasn't so funny at the time is now hilarious. I think it's because there's a promise of more to come, so you're reading a story and not just one strip at a time. So why check Achewood every day? I just love talkin' to you guys. *HUUUUUUGS!*
