(Didn't think of "Let's talk about your avatar", did you?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have a boot of the late 90s Steve Albini remix and re-record of Cheap Trick's "In Color." It's missing a few harmonies and minor instruments, but it's overall pretty fucking incredible and a vast improvement over the weak 1977 production... Imagine the guitar riff to "You're All Talk" in Albini's hands...

      This is my first account, before I decided on a better name.  I love the Atomizer EP artwork as much as I do Songs About Fucking but the writing is so small you don't get the joke unless you already know it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was surprised to find that Achewood has a good number of people that dig Albini and Big Black, just like its cool to chat with other people who've read The Invisibles. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Havn't gotten to Cheap Trick yet on my Journey Through Music but from what I hear they influenced alot of what I listen to (Nirvana, etc...) <br/>

      The Invisibles is basically my favourite comic. A friend of mine asked me to describe it, and I said "William S. Burroughs with more pictures", which is enormous praise coming from my mouth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, my friend didn't know who Burroughs was, so I left to find better friends.

      Since the most common definition or the one that first comes to mind is that of a "medieval poet and musician", without the race angle it makes far less sense.

      The Old Fashioned Geek Chinaman N-Bomb <br/> 
 <br/> 
2oz whiskey <br/> 
1/2oz dry vermouth <br/> 
1/2oz Pernod <br/> 
Dash Angostura Bitters <br/> 
1 huamei (preserved plum) <br/> 
Soda <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fill a tumbler with ice and top with a huamei or two.  Add the whiskey, vermouth, Pernod, and bitters, and stir.  Top with soda.  Let it sit for a minute so the huamei can "steep" before drinking.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Huamei are crazy little things that you can find at an Asian market, I guess in like the snack food section.  The only English I can find on my bag says "PRESERVED FRUITS" so identifying them may be nontrivial.  Alternately, you could substitute with a maraschino cherry, making an Old Fashioned Geek Croat N-Bomb.)

      It was a good opportunity to learn where maraschino cherries come from!  Also, after posting this I learned that one should toss this drink down pretty quick, because if the huamei steeps for too long it gets real nasty real fast.  So I should warn people about that.  Definitely a nonlinear nastiness curve there.

      There's a strip from 2001, "the worst Achewood strip" by many estimations, and likely to remain that way as that's before Onstad was making his living from Achewood, in which Teodor and Lyle admit to the audience that Onstad didn't bother to come up with a punch line. Also, the one-year anniversary strip has Teodor thanking us for our readership and not wearing any pants.

      I went with the latter. Imagine attending your neighbourhood racialist rally, and all of a sudden several hundred pickles on tiny cucumber floats and even more with crude marching-band instruments behind them. Would even you, a most vehement racialist, want to keep listening to the 70-year-old speaker on stage expounding on the best places to find still-segregated water fountains? No you would not. You would watch the pickle parade.
