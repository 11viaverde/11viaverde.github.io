      I never received a talk of any sort.  Nor did I have any contact with persons of either sex during any of my school years.  Everything I know I learned from the Spice Channel, where the Downstairs Bits were always obscured by a plant or a lamp or a statue or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After my father moved out, my mother revealed that he thought that I and my three brothers were gay because we never brought home any girls.  I was not aware that I was expected to, nor did I know how. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thanks, Dad!

      I was reading biology textbooks from about the age of 6... so I never had to be told about sex or how it worked, biologically speaking.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said... when the sex-ed classes we had in school at the age of 13 got to the bit about masturbation, THAT is when I finally screwed my face up and had to admit I thought they were bluffing. I mean engaging in coitus for reproductive purposes makes total sense, but the idea of just handling the parts for whatever reason just struck me as absurd.  <br/>

      My version of the talk came from my dad, was mercifully short, and REALLY late. Basically one day he just came in looking really uncomfortable, said "so, uh, you, uh, know how everything works, right?" I said "yeah," he said "Oh thank God. Want to go play some ball?" and we did.

      One of my favourite of Onstad's blog entries. Surprisingly, not just because of the mental image of dancing with the enlarged head of Frances McDormand.

      I've never had the talk.  But my mom's a shrink, so I've heard plenty about sex and such at dinner.  Also schizophrenia and the broken system.  We're pretty frank in my family, but my mom is also wicked traditional like I wan't allowed to call boys.  It would make me look desperate? <br/>

      my talk was fairly brief. i had been sent home with a pamphlet from school which they said "talk to your parents about this."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
so i said "dad, school wants me to talk to you about this." "you got any questions?" "nope." "good talk son."

      I got the talk in sixth grade. I had a girlfriend (well, sort of, I mean, we were in elementary school, and we never kissed or anything. I think I maybe hugged her once). Anyway, some teacher or something had found a note in which someone pretending to be either me or my girlfriend, I forget which, wrote some apparently nasty, nasty stuff. I never saw the letter so I don't know what was in it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, parents were notified, etc., and mine decided it was time for the talk, and they gave me a book to read.

      It's good that he knows Ray is this supportive, my dad was so against me learning anything about sex that when my hamster started being in heat and would do this stiff pose and stick her tale up, he shot her with a tazer and she exploded.
