      I vaguely remember a story a friend told me once, where he was at this lan party and they invited a stripper.  Everyone was really too distracted by video games to pay much attention to her, but there was an extra comp open so she just ended up playing video games and shot the shit with them.  Apparently she was a pretty cool person. <br/>

Granted that wasn't a bachelor party, but I can imagine pretty much the same stuff going down.

      The cleverness is parody in this strip.  First, Ray is reading a magazine that he would probably never look at except that he is trying to plan a fun party for his friend... I would love to know the title of it.  Next, Ostad pulls a satirical tour de force by precisely nailing the modern PC stag-party.  Ray's despair is the re-humanizing cherry on top.

      The deepest interpretation would suggest that Ray is still suffering from Player's Block, a condition prolonged by his sub-conscious jealousy and self-doubt over not having his own main woman to call his own. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In any event, ray will soon enough realize the book is nothing more than a short man's peddling of a weekend philosophy.  Maybe a couple knuckleheads from old times don't NEED an evening of classic debauchery, but sometimes it's exactly what they want.  What they DESERVE.

      I am planning a bachelor party for one of my old-times knuckleheads, but I am trying to keep him as in the dark as possible about it.  I am tempted to print this out and leave it lying around his pad, along with the strip where Ray condenses Beef's BP down to a pill.  Just to see the dude twitch.

      This may be how it is in california, in Wisconsin they go out in the woods and have a fire, guns, and enough alcohol to kill the lot of them if actually consumed. I believe the tradition may have stemmed from a belief that a marriage unfavored by god would curse the whole clan, and so they had to give god an easy chance to kill the man beforehand if he so desires.
