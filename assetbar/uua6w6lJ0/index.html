      Achewood is the best webcomic, and one of the best of all of the things that people make. You will note that I do not bitch about the strip per se. I just have questions. <br/> 
It is a very good strip.

      Damn man for fuck's sake. I've made at most a dozen negative comments on strips not for no reason, but because I think they are the worst strips and Achewood has a fuck-high standard (check my record for positive comments if you're feeling pedantic). I ask questions because they are fun to throw up, rather than as pure bitching. You have a Problem that is not on me.

      I was in my angry-young-man stage when I lived there so wasn't much for waterparks. I went there once with a group of people and we were all very drunk. I had a blast but that may have been due to the combination of booze and waterpark not waterpark alone.

      I recently found out this guy is serving time for trying to rob a video store with a hammer. He just had two years added to his sentence for trying to smuggle cigarettes in his ass when he was transferred from a Kentucky jail back to Vermont. The video he brought up to the counter at the place he tried to rob was season one of the HBO series "OZ". Sometimes life is kinda awesome.

      Hover your cursor over the strip and leave it there. It should show up in a little window. <br/> 
If it doesn't, or it doesn't display all the way, you can  get a plug in from Firefox that will fix it. Someone showed me how to do that, but now I don't remember. I am less helpful than that person.
