      Umm, I think the direction Ray is taking the project means that the issue is whether any WOMAN will love her. I don't know how facial scarring plays into girl-girl action. Maybe a fringe audience? The same ones aroused by pics of Brazilian-wax accident scarring?

      You were certain she wouldn't catch you as you defiled yourself.  She catches you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You explain in your head that it's ok, because she can't be expected to meet your needs and you're actually taking the pressure off of her, but she feels betrayed no less.  And you argue, and as usual you win, because your logic is always flawless and dammit you've become your father.  But you hate it, you hate yourself, you hate her for not being like you, for being fucked up in other ways.  And you don't know if you over-analyze things so that you will be right and she will be damaged. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And she screams obscenities, things you know you've taught her, and it seems wrong coming from her delicate features, and you hate yourself more.  Her face screws up into something fierce and red as she slams the door, yelling that she's going back to Kiev and goddammit this is it this time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And you let her go because you have conflicted feelings, and you hate confliction inside yourself.  And you hate her because she makes it complicated, because she made you something you never wanted to be, something that feels alien and vulnerable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And after simmering in your thoughts for what must be a few hours, looking at her picture with her high forehead and soft hair and delicate chin and cruel mouth, you tell her that you will find her, no matter where she goes.  And you pick up your knife and rope and car keys and leave. <br/> 
 <br/> 
She was certain you wouldn't catch her, now that she defiled herself.  You catch her.

      Speaking of Flagship Pornography: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Captain Darrell Smythe-Jones stood on the foredeck of the HMS  <em>Vesuvio</em> .  Fresh from a long tour in the Western Mediterranean defending Gibraltar from the dusky-hued Spaniards, Smythe-Jones was eagerly awaiting homeport in Plymouth, when suddenly an alarum sounded below decks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I say, what goes on down there!" said Smythe-Jones. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Suddenly, the midships hatch burst open, and the Carpenter's Mate and the Coxswain emerged, dragging what looked like a sack of potatoes, but on further inspection was a stunning blonde, dressed in burlap sack. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Beggin' yer pardon, Cap'n, but we found us a stowaway!" Coxwain Pember shouted to the bridge.  "Permission to toss her overboard for chum." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Smythe-Jones was on the verge of waving a curt agreement to the coxwain, until the girl suddenly lurched, and her hair fell in a curl about her face.  Upon seeing the curl of her hair, and the delicious  <em>moue</em>  of her mouth, the captain was suddenly taken back to a particular shore leave on the shores of Gdansk, (or Danzig as it was then known), in a time before the guns sounded again for the second time in a scant score of years, before the war made a hash of love and blood and lust and fear.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
He remembered Lola in that moment, and he stayed his hand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Mr. Coxwain." <br/> 
"Sir?" <br/> 
"Bring the stowaway to my quarters.  She may have come to steal this flagship's new Vesuvio espresso technology. I will have to deal with her...in my own good time.  Bring her to my sea cabin, and I will interview her, see what she knows." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Smythe-Jones paused, and a smile curled on his lips.  "And after intense interrogation under the strictest of measures, but gentlest of tones, I might even have to  <em>(continued on order sheet, pg. 79)</em>   <br/>

Actually, perhaps if you made the machine flesh-colored it would have some kind of synergistic effect with the flagship porno.

      No, this is yet another abortive and not-very-funny arc. Onstad has been off his game ever since he got the deal with Dark Horse. If you A/B any one of the strips from the past 18 months with any one from, say, four years ago you'll instantly see that Achewood used to be much better written and a lot more fun.

      Glenda pulled a sheet cake from her oven. It sat perfectly in the middle of her Williams-Sonoma 12" Steel Cake Pan with Bronzed Handles, a small amount of steam rising from its lightly tanned top. She set it on the counter to let it cool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just then the doorbell rang. She knew who had arrived. Glenda opened the door, smiling. Ronaldo stood there, leaning against the wall, his trouser cuffs at just the right length for his shoes. "Hello, my dear," he said in a near-whisper, and entered the palatial home. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A half hour later, Ronaldo emerged from the kitchen holding the sheet cake which he had just easily frosted using a Williams-Sonoma Chrome Cake Froster (available with your choice of two wooden handles, see p.321). "Are you ready?" he asked with a sly smile. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glenda let her dressing gown fall to the floor and wiggled her panty-clad bottom. "Am I ever," she moaned.

      eh?  okay... I'm heading to the Wiki...   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415013935/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Witnesses believe there are two destinations for those saved by God. They say the number of Christians going to heaven is limited to precisely 144,000, who will rule with Jesus as kings and priests over earth.[122] The remainder have the hope of living forever in an earthly paradise.[123] <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that death is a state of non-existence with no consciousness. They do not believe in any Hell of fiery torment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They consider the body and the soul to be the same living being that expires.[138] Their hope for life after death involves being resurrected by God, either with a new body on earth after Armageddon, or to heaven for the limited number of 144,000. <br/> 
 <br/> 
noting about their beliefs vis-a-vis jews, however. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In all, Jehovah's Witnesses brought 23 separate First Amendment actions before the U.S. Supreme Court between 1938 and 1946. U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Harlan Fiske Stone wrote, "The Jehovah's Witnesses ought to have an endowment in view of the aid which they give in solving the legal problems of civil liberties."[citation needed] <br/> 
 <br/> 
The fighting words doctrine was established by Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942). In that case, a Jehovah's Witness had reportedly told a New Hampshire town marshal who was attempting to prevent him from preaching "You are a damned racketeer" and "a damned fascist" and was arrested. The court upheld the arrest, thus establishing that "insulting or 'fighting words', those that by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace" are among the "well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech [which] the prevention and punishment of...have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem."

      All of the major monotheistic religions go through a similar cycle of fundamental zeal.  The Jews felt that God commanded them to slaughter the other tribes, the Catholic Church mounted armies against "heathen," and factions of Islam now feel the same way toward "infidels."  Its the same god, the same human species, and the same "my way is best" attitude used to justify murder. <br/>

      Watch "Constantine's Sword," totally worthwhile documentary. (and maybe watch Mel Gibson's "Passion of the Christ") There are plenty of Christians "not nearly as familiar with the Bible" as they ought to be, if your statement holds true. And today, not 400 years ago. Or a thousand years ago, when the First Crusade took place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Watch South Park, for Christ's sake! Plenty of Cartmans around, all fired up about the Jews killing Jesus. Ted Haggard being one of them, extending his tentacles into the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. Evangelist cadets harassing Jewish cadets, chaplains spreading the Good Word.

      The only Christian I know who has a problem with Jews is my grandfather, who is nearly 80 and I believe has other reasons for not liking Jews.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I strongly believe the whole "teh Jews killed JESUS!" thing was the media exaggerating the controversy generated by  <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>  (which was not in any way racist toward Jews, despite the prejudiced leanings of Mel Gibson). I would not doubt that the production company behind the movie had a hand in this as well. Controversy sells, after all.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The fact is, technically, yeah, Jews did kill Jesus, or at least allowed/demanded that it happen (the actual killing per se would have been performed by Romans). I don't hold it against Jews now, because a) that was 2000 years ago and not one of those particular Jews is alive today and b) they believed he was a false prophet blaspheming God by claiming to be the Messiah. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Are there Christians prejudiced against Jews? Sure. But there's people in every walk of life who hold some form of prejudice against another race/class/sexuality/gender/whatever. I believe in pretty much every case, those people are a minority. I do not believe that Christians, ON THE WHOLE, have problems with the Jews. Those who do are probably ignorant of their religion's history, and therefore should not be indicative of the rest of us.

antisemitism is not controversial, it simply is.  The population of the US, is, on average, one of the most ignorant and uneducated populations of any 1st world country.  (If you disagree, that's another discussion.)  Prejudice such as antisemitism is going to flourish most where there is the most ignorance and lack of education.  One could extrapolate, therefore, that the U.S. population, on average, might be pretty damn prejudiced against Jews.  If your own personal anecdotal experience or your own perspective via whatever lens you use ('the media?') does not show the U.S. population to be all that antisemitic, well that's great, but is not an objective nor reliable indicator. <br/>

      Once again Onstad appears quite upset by our criticisms of the strip and the direction it has been going in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While this is certainly his prerogative I must wonder about whether it is a good idea to adopt this approach to one's audience. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I could simply be seeing something that isn't really there. That this was all just an attempt to get Cornelius out of the current arc, but it would certainly not appear to be the first time. Likewise it seems to correlate with Onstad who has increasingly found ways to seemingly isolate himself from his audience compared to other web comic creators. He has no daily text, the blog was infrequent and appears to have ceased entirely, he occasionally posts smaller pieces behind a pay wall, but most of it seems to be trifles from the creation of the strip and not further insight. Even the brief line of text has morphed into being an advertisement and a source of lies about when to begin expecting a new strip.

      I was referring to the opening of this strip. The idea of constant editorial interference by a clueless person finally causing the author himself to lose it seemed like it might have been aimed at us. <br/>

It sounds like I'm probably not correct though since nobody else seems to be seeing this.

      I'd assume that Polly's departure was because of what a negative reaction her character received, and Onstad decided to drop her entirely rather than try to flesh out her character and make her more acceptable to the fans. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I imagine whether he'll ever bring her back depends on his motivations for creating her. If he intended for her to be a serious addition to the cast it'd be odd to drop her entirely, but if it was just a half hearted attempt at adding a new element to the strip, it'd be easy to see why he'd lose interest. Another possibility is that he just hasn't felt like doing another storyline with her, since Onstad's pretty bad at balancing character appearances.

      Thank you for calling that out. ICP themselves speak out quite vehemently against racism. Their fan base, on the other hand, seems to be composed of ignorant white suburbanites with a penchant for random and chaotic violence. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In short, the fans who get 'the message' of the mythology of ICP (which seems almost like a hebrew prophecy if vocalised: stop your evil ways before you destroy yourself) are few and far between.

[Watch out, catgrl's 'bout to be droppin some Jew Knowledge]If I remember Rabbinics class correctly, The Pharisees were a Jewish sect that lived during the time of the second temple. They were a sect that was relatively respectful of others, and kind of the ancient jewish equivalent of the Amish, abstaining from luxury and such. And I guess they probably had beards. That looked like pubic hairs. Probably. Who knew Glad had some serious Jew chops? [/Jew Knowledge] <br/>
