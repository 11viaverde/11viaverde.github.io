      I don't know WHERE to begin answering the unusual string of response and analysis of my off-the-cuff snide remark. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't read any knowledge of these references into "let me in on the joke" and so referred him to a place outside of this forum in order to find out. Sure I said it a way that was mildly dick-esque; every now and then this place gets filled with superfluous information and my scrolling finger gets tired. <br/>

In short: I typed a quick off-the-cuff snide comment and pressed enter.  <br/>

      In all fairness it did work in the preview leading me to believe that Assetbarrista was performing some magic to make it possible. Perhaps it does work, but only for those of us with the foresight to try and fix the system and willing to reload (and thus lose all of our unread markers) in order for it to work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your compromise was masterful, true, but my pedantic instincts left me unable to avoid doing it properly.

      i've seen some coen brothers films, and i understand what jumping the shark refers to, but i also didn't really get his comment at first and i don't know what i would google to explain it. his phrasing pretty much makes it sound like this arc is ripping off a specific film of theirs (unless the coen brothers invented dark humor?) <br/>

      Man, I tried googling civility and I got "formal or perfunctory politeness" and "politeness: the act of showing regard for others."   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe my interblagosphere is down (I imagine sort of like when a dump truck gets a flat tire?).  Maybe google is broken.  Maybe Princeton wordnet doesn't know its English real good, it is difficult to tell. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Here is my theory: <br/> 
 <br/> 
A 3 second superficial reply to a question in a social interaction as compared to a 3 second (15 or so in your case, neonfreon) unwarranted, rude, dismissal of a simple request is probably what dissembly meant when they suggested civility.  Hard to be sure but sometimes people just want a superficial explanation to satisfy their curiosity because perhaps they don't have 15 minutes to browse a couple wikipedia pages looking for something that could have been given in, well, 3 seconds.  Not everyone can spend that sort of time just for curiosity's sake or, once again in your case neonfreon, just to be a dick.

      This is the price one pays for being ESL.  It doesn't help that I was placed into school above the grades where they teach grammar.  Well, they still taught it but when you don't know what a verb or noun is, exactly, an in depth explanation of a gerund is basically a foreign language (esp. when explained in a foreign language, emirite?).

      Exactly my point :P <br/> 
 <br/> 
But in all seriousness, Google does not perform the same function as asking a question of a human being. The internet's information retrieval abilities are substantially different to a fellow forum-dweller's. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Google cannot guide you to the meaning of something in a particular context, for example. It cannot provide you with information biased by the person you're asking (e.g. maybe i want a muslim to tell me what he thinks eating pork is all about - i'll get different sorts of information from asking my muslim friend than from Googling it; not necessarily higher or lower quality info, just different). Google often produces hidden biases, as well. You can't Google "global warming" and expect to get accurate information, for example. You might have good reason for asking a meterologist directly rather than "googling it". Ditto most controversial issues. The internet is jam-packed with lies, and, unlike in a social interaction (where you can assess the other person's response meaningfully to some degree), it's much harder to tell *when* you'rebeing lied to. Especially when you don't know enough about what you're asking about to know whether there is likely to be any sort of controversy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Asking a direct question of someone yields contextualised, real-world information (i.e. explained in a way that makes sense to what you're trying to understand), and information that is filtered through a human in a meaningful way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For example, if you asked me to tell you about _Pteridinium_ (a fossil organism i am writing my thesis on), i am going to be able to give you ten times as much information as any Google search, i could write a mini essay for you, perfectly tailored to whatever aspect of it you were asking about. You are not going to get that from Google. Which brings up another point - Googling can be completely useless with many obscure topics. I have had quite a few situations where googling something produced absolutely nothing whatsoever. You still get lots of hits, but none of them are remotely what you were looking for. Contrary to what you suggested, it can often be way more superficial to Google something than to ask someone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
BUT that might not seem to apply to a question about some small thing like "jumping the shark", so this is really the core thing i want to say:  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What makes it a question of Nettiquette rather than just pragmatism: there are social reasons for asking questions of humans. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You get integrated into some sort of community. You have a back and forth. You go off onto tangents that you didn't expect (Google gives you this one too, yes, but it ain't the same... it's like sex versus masterbation). You end up creating memories with people, you form in-jokes, you offer the person you're asking the opportunity to make a joke, be friendly, put their own spin on whatever you're asking them about: in short, you have a social interaction. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The internet might have been a boon for people with Aspergers (i actually don't know), but that's a small percentage of the population. Some of us actually want to interact with living, breathing people, and want to ask them *their* opinions - with all their living, breathing biases. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(btw: I'm not conceding anything about Googling being less biased, by the way - if anything, Google is more biased than asking a human. You don't get some broad survey of human knowledge on some topic - you get popular results, news-related results, results that are biased without even telling you exactly HOW they would be biased (if you asked a human being, you could have corrected for it. But google results are not predictably biasing in the same way).) <br/> 
 <br/> 
To respond to an honest request in a social millieu with "Google it" is un-civil and crappy nettiquette because it is basically an affront to the other person's move towards being sociable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They never hurt you; your suggestion that they are asking you to "waste their time superficially explaining a fact that could be easily referenced in much richer detail" is totally, demonstrably false. Perhaps you could make some sort of an argument if you were actually one of the people being *asked* the question - *maybe* - but in general, nobody is forcing you to explain anything. All they're doing is asking, and in a perfectly polite way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nobody has invited you (or, rather, woodenteeth) to direct them to Google. In fact, nobody even remotely familiar with the internet would *need* to make such an invitation. We all know it's there. Asking rather than Googling is not an oversight. People ask (rather than Google) for good reasons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Replying with "Google it" is presumptuous, un-invited, a little bit stupid (for the pragmatic reasons i listed first off), and just plain rude (for the social reasons i listed secondly). <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you actually HAVE Asperger's or some similar psychiatric disorder, it is perhaps understandable. But unless that is the case, responding to most questions with "Google it" is a grade-A dick move. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And that is why i take a couple of seconds to jump on people doing it. <br/>

      I totally agree there is a place for asking people questions and getting human responses.  However, I don't understand why you believe people universally, or even typically, ask other humans good questions.  I present you exhibit A: Yahoo! Answers, home of "how is babby formed", etc.  That's a clear counterexample to your assertion that people know what they're doing when they ask questions online.  I'll grant that assetbar's demographic is at least a cut above Yahoo! Answers', but asking good questions is a learned skill, and thespoof's vague question doesn't do him much service... <br/> 
 <br/> 
To ask a good question is to communicate as clearly as possible what piece of information you're lacking about a given subject in a given context.  I think  <em>woodenteeth's</em>  response to thespoof's question probably has something to do with thespoof's question not clearly communicating what part of the joke he was having trouble understanding.  Given the context, the joke, and his response, we don't have any way of knowing where to start explaining the joke.  Does he know who the Coen brothers are?  Is he familiar with their style?  Has he ever seen Happy Days?  Or is he a pop culture whiz and just doesn't get the application of the references to the strip, or maybe he does, and doesn't understand the humor? <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I see woodenteeth's "rude" response as being more of a sharp poke in the ribs to perhaps shame thespoof for being too lazy to either not google background info on his own first, or to fail to use his existing knowledge to ask a better question.  Go google and come back and say "i know this and that but i don't get this" or "this is what i think it means.. is that right?".  Don't ask people to explain stuff you're to do the work you're too lazy to do, and you won't get curt "google it" responses.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Interacting with humans is great, but I try to keep my interaction meaningful/useful/novel/entertaining, and not just because hey we need human interaction so lets use any excuse for it!

      neon freon, everything you say is sound, but you're missing one point - everything is relative... in one breath you criticize one comment for being too ambiguous, yet in the next breath you gloss over the ambiguity of woodenteeth's comment.  We don't know if woodenteeth was being snide, rude, sardonic, or what... The more you know someone, the more nuance there is in your interpretation of their comments.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway.  Precision and accuracy and clarity in language are... only ever possible to an extent.  Your assertion that these things are of the utmost importance is not fully backed up by cogent argument.  There is always more awareness than language can explicitly and semantically convey...

      I will take my Humble Pill, but only because my inital comment was snide and in knee jerk response to try and stop further cut/paste jobs straight from Wikipedia straight explaining the references and NOT for resisting the nuance involved with the relations involved in a joke and human interaction.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think your thesis here relies on a quality of interaction that was not really that apparent. You seem to assume two people are sincerley engaged in dialogue. An assumption which has it's obvious difficulties as all dialogue here is in text form. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mine was an off-the-cuff, fairly snide comment. It also referred mostly to the Jumping the Shark comment. The Coen Bros similarity wasn't particularly apparent to me either aside from the fact that Onstad and the Coen's work is weird, funny and poignant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
... but then, these are all my living breathing biases of opinion. So careful what types of interaction you shut down there partner.

      woodenteeth - "I think your thesis here relies on a quality of interaction that was not really that apparent" - oh no, it's really just that someone asked some question, and someone else said 'google it'. You may not have been motivated by, for example, "affronting someones attempt to be socialable", but thats the effect it has on other people reading it (me at least). <br/> 
 <br/> 
The brief, impersonal bursts of text are the standard internet medium. It's them that matter when referring to nettiquette. I'm really, really not complaining about the tone being snide - it's the words "google it" that are the thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the record; it's not just that you said it then that pissed me off. Maybe the first time someone said some variant of "google it", it was mildly amusing. But then someone else said it, and someone else in another corner of the internet, and ten more people (and then some dickhead created this webpage - https://lmgtfy.com/?q=i hate whoever created this stupid fucking meme ). <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then, a couple of days before reading this thread, i shit you not, i did a google search for some technical problem, and the only relevant link that came up a Yahoo Answers page, where somebody had responded to a technical query with the "let me google that for you" webpage - and of course you click on it, and - I SHIT YOU NOT! - THAT IS THE ONLY RELEVANT RESULT THAT COMES UP! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really wish i could link you to it now so you could see the absolute inanity of it!

      I kind of only skimmed this thread arc, something about Pteridinium and the coen bros, but it looks great. I've saved it as an .rtf file (the truest format) in my Internet>Arguments>Aholes>Context_Pissing_Contest folder and will peruse, at leisure, with a small mug of warm chianti and a delicious Hot-Pocket. I will be wearing a robe, untied, and nothing else. <br/>

      MiH was good, but it lasted for such a short period of time, IIRC. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Webcomics are so often a labor of love that they tend to flame out fairly readily. Hell, it happens in any creative field. I'd thought Onstad was a lifer, able to keep 'em coming out every week, but I guess not. Burns twice as bright, but half as long and all that.

      Christ man.. You hit the nail on the head. Farber was the first Dave Chapelle, wasn't he.. He couldn't handle the criticism or the expectation, let alone the fame. I think Onstad is a bit more disconnected though; I almost get the feeling that he writes these comics exclusively without expectation of applause or even for our benefit. <br/> 
I miss MiH something bad, though.. My heart hurts every time I scroll past my Dead Webcomics bookmark folder.

      Onstadt is getting B^U Disease. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Tim Fuckley, aka "Pedo-Tim", aka Timothy Bradley Buckley, proprietor of the web-site cad-comic.com, is a noteworthy sufferer of B^U Disease.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
He is the artist behind a web-comic with enough words to wholly obscure the artwork, resulting in a novel with pictures.  His writing is an atrocity to behold.  His artwork, even worse.  And the worst part is that his Google footnote calls his art 'A Humorous commentary on Videogames'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
https://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20080602 <br/> 
 <br/>

This comic highlights Fuckley's B^U Disease to the fullest.  Long, unfunny dialogue, bad, repetitive art. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He is also known for emailing photos of his penis to underaged girls.

      Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows--a colourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues--every stately or lovely emblazoning--the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge--pondering all this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him.  <br/>

      These aren't white trash, not only white trash anyway, they seem to be shut ins that have become so isolated from normalcy that they have made their own sense of things that isn't relative to anyone else. If you've ever seen "hoarders" there are some people like that. The human culture version of those cave species that are unique to their cave because they evolved there in solitude.

      It's a sad documentary show about people who have filled their house with trash and won't get rid of any. It airs in the US and I don't know where else. In one scene the therapist is sitting with a woman atop a mountain of junk in her living room, holding up half a hanger asking "Do you think you could handle us throwing this out? This is the kind of thing we would throw away" and the woman, half frantic at another person touching her stuff replies "but, I could maybe cut it up and glue it to a board for like a craft project."

      I believe there is quite a bit of video documentary work on the internet exploring the occurrence of promiscuous housewives. Still, it lacks refinement and uses a lot of informal nomenclature. Perhaps a more professional study is called for.

      I get the feeling Onstad has never met, seen, or heard someone from the south firsthand. I get the feeling that is the dialect he is aiming for at least. In his mind, they are mythical beasts that speak an antiquated and mutilated tongue and raise chinchillas for their faith, fame, and finances.  <br/> 
My other idea is that Onstad has tried to combine every single dialect of every white trash culture in the States into one omnitrash language that is almost entirely impossible to read.

      I'd go with this being an attempt at an omini-trash argot. You know the David Cross routine about the US-wide redneck accent. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not sure what to think. Onstad's got a great ear for language and interesting constructions. On the other hand, his reproductions of accents are not always as great.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I thought Lurquilla and Maynard's first bit of dialogue was pretty good; it certainly stuck in my head. These last couple of appearances are a bit grating because their accent just doesn't ... scan? Can't think of a better word.

      Not so-I moved to Georgia ten years prior, and was able to effortlessly breeze through Lurquilla and Maynard's dialogue. Although if they did speak like that here, it would sound a bit silly. <br/>

      Agreed. Lurquilla and Maynard are possibly the worst minor characters Chris has ever come up with. Reading their strips is like watching a thalidomide baby try to swim across the English Channel. <br/>

Oh well, no one bats a thousand. Just have to kill time until the next arc.

      O Dear GOD.  I hoped for a moment it was particularly obscure non-sequitor humour in the vein of the Perry Bible Fellowship, but no.  It was a deadly serious developing story arc.  "The adolescent golfer has disappointed his high-achieving father through inattention to the game."  Et cetera.

      Despite being published for over fifty years I only heard about this comic even existing today. I already feel like it has been slowly building up over the years just to punish me. One of these days the dam will break open and I will be forced to read them all as penance for some future evil.

 <br/> 
Pete returns.  Lurquilla tells Pete about Mayner's apparent bowel problems in the interest of full disclosure, fearing should Mayner shit himself without warning Pete can sue due to a Mental Surprise.  Mayner is clearly embarrassed by this and takes the time to connect this with the deeper issue of Lurquilla's dissatisfaction with their marriage.  Lurquilla reveal's Mayner, for whatever reason, couldn't provide her with a biological brood that is now substituted by her chinchillas and in a moment of Crazy asks Pete if he can deliver.  Pete obliges.  Lurquilla takes her chinchillas and enters the van to what horrors, only Nathan, T, and Onstad know. <br/>

      yeah, but at this point, it's hard to consider slams on Onstad's promptness trolling.  It can only be considered ironic trolling at this point.  This is kind of like that 'what is art' question.  If someone accidentally ironically trolls, is it still ironic trolling?  Is it genuine trolling?  Woof's patterns of statements lack a lot of the context that would help us to answer these questions.  So that's why I'm kind of calling everyone out on having gotten out the jump to conclusions mat.  <br/>

      How is the comment "stirring shit"?  I can't even come up with a hypothetical scenario where woof's comment could be considered stirring shit.  Beyond that, I think a better definition of trolling is writing something that is deliberately intended to anger another.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
How would anyone get angry just because woof claims some sort of status from an incident that, while not something that he had any direct involvement in, is pretty damn intense to have happen to people you know even slightly, and would definitely have a person yammering for a while afterwards to at least defuse the shock of it.  Silly?  I suppose, if he is making it up, but I don't think so.

      When you do a murder-suicide, it's important to get it in the right order. Boy would you have egg on your face! You also have to choose the right method. Some poor choices:  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rolling off your bed until the people downstairs complain <br/> 
 <br/> 
Eating really hot sauce <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rigging up the front door so when the delivery man comes a shotgun shoots you both (you cannot count on this working 100% of the time)

      huh.  yeah I've heard of New Zealand before (Redirected from New zeland) and I'm aware that it's to some extent or other administratively distinct from Australia, and it's an island... but damn... I should know more than that... I'm not sure if it's off the left or right coast of Australia, or how far off it is.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
See the problem I have with New Zealand, and I'm sure a lot of other people have this problem too, is that my memory and understanding of things tends to be very visual.  And Australia is just too far off in the corner of the map to visualize it with all that much resolution.  It's off there over at the edge of the world map.  There are no major roads that go there, so my memory and perception basically is just not too concerned with it.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I mean is, Australia is sort of off there in the peripheral vision of my mind's eye.  It's all fuzzy.  If it jumps at me, I will probably reflexively cringe, but that's about it.   <br/> <br/> <br/>

      Do you realize how much of that $200 got to Onstad? <br/> 
 <br/> 
$100 - Manufacturer fees and materials <br/> 
$5 - credit card, debit card, or Paypal fees <br/> 
$20 - Shipping <br/> 
$20 - Income Tax <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's only about $45 that gets to Onstad. I may have missed some things. That's ignoring the expenses he has just keeping the site running, which includes server space and bandwidth, technical work, etc. And the time he spends actually handling the payments and shipping and updating the store (or else paying someone else to do it) which has nothing to to with producing the comic.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like when you give $50 to a call center charity drive for a local fire department and the fire department gets only $5.

      I, too, stand in the camp of the fans.  THIS IS NOT, you oblivious fools, AN ATTEMPT TO SIMULATE ANY REAL ACCENT.  Onstad has taken surrealism beyond narrative and into dialogue.  Not just the dialect, but the tone and content and logic, of these characters is absurd and dreamlike.  I've moved around a lot through a number of backwoods and these two are speaking something that is undeniably but inexplicably familiar, like a film by Jeunet or a painting by Redon.  It IS accurate--just not specific.

      I hesitate to say that this is bad, but it does feel like Achewood has changed in the last year or so into a comic that I no longer enjoy, but just keep up with out of habit and in the hope that it returns to absurd humour rather than psychotic darkness. <br/>

Has it ever occurred to anyone that Achewood could be a pictorial representation of the gradual journey of the author into schizophrenia?

      I think the Nice Van, if of the Mexican Magical Realism manufacture, must radiate a field that inhibits fear and inhibitions.  <br/>

      Yeah, I've been rockin' this tan for the past few weeks. I'm certainly not shut-in. My creepiness levels are significantly lower than the average male of my age.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
thespoof didn't offer a semantics argument, as semantics concerns meaning and word choice whereas your mistake was almost certainly a typographical error (you did not choose "wasted", you just mis-typed it).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
thespoof also did not present an argument. He pointed out a possible grammatical error and  <em>asked</em>  if either of two other possibilities were what you meant.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
His comment was as necessary as yours or mine or any other online. Which is to say, not very.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Finally, at the time tttt2 posted his reply, there were only two people in the conversation. Two people can hardly be called "a bunch." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll leave alone the many other grammatical errors present.

      So, a man walks up to Chris Onstad and tells him about an idea for a story arc. <br/> <br/> <br/> Well, we're going to have this serial killer, see? And he's going to go to one of his friends in the middle of the night and drag that friend out of bed, naked, throw him in the back of a van, bash him around, and have him take a shit on the lawn of a redneck chinchilla farm. The serial killer then burns the redneck farm to the ground by mistake, then drives to a Denny's.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once there he's going to take his clothes off, then go into the Denny's and allow an elderly homosexual to feel him up. He'll take the homosexual back to the van, and then put him and his friend in the back and lock them in. Then the homosexual will coerce the naked friend into performing a sex act. Meanwhile, the chinchilla farmers suffer a falling out, leading the female farmer to take her chinchillas and attempt to get impregnated by the serial killer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad says, that's freaking awesome, I have just one question: What should I call it? <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the man says "The Aristo-Cats!" <br/>

      The gap between updates and the batshit accents are, while undeniably irritating, not what disappoints me about this arc. What does is the relentless slog it presents, with no reward for the reader, no hook to keep him/her interested, just depressing plot thickening after depressing plot thickening. Even the cheesiest horror movie has a few jumps, or failing that a few laughs at how terrible it is. <br/>

      heh see that sounds fairly well adjusted.  Me, I would covet my spoils.  I once stole a whole stack of notebooks from the grade school, because I had some weird OCD aspergic attraction to the things.  They were and still are to this day beautiful.  (I still have one I think that I made into a stamp album)   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or for instance I went through the neighborhood with a screw driver stealing position and turn signal light bulbs from cars. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This one time in junior high I stole this girl's yearbook.  (I didn't buy one of my own because I had no interest in it, not really socializing with anyone, but when the opportunity presented it's self to swipe the yearbook, I was compulsively attracted to the bright shiny novel valuable (if for no other reason than scarcity) thing.)  I sort of vaguely remember it having something of a sexual aspect to it, leafing through the pages of this stolen co-ed's yearbook, reading the things her friends had written, although I'm sure at the time I didn't really recognize it as being deviant or sexual per se.  It was undoubtedly just more weirdness for an already weird and troubled perspective on the world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think I probably still have that yearbook somewhere.. (something of a hoarder, I am)  If I do, I should find it and track her down and give it back to her.  I don't feel like I should apologize per se.  After all, the honest explanation is 'hey I was a fucked up kid with a fucked up life and jacking off to your yearbook photo while squeezing the last bit of life out of the neighbor's cat's kittens and then frantically giving them CPR until they came back over and over again was some of the best times and the source of some of the fondest memories for this 15 yr old kid (I was held back several years.)  (Okay that part about jacking off and the kittens and being held back was a fabrication.  I was diverging.  But anyway, I diverge... <br/> 
 <br/> 
yes, I should track her down and return to her her yearbook.. maybe I should scan it first, now that we have scanners... just.. a hoarding compulsion.  nothing deviant or sexual.  Just... it's hard to explain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But anyway, if I do track her down, I know what it'll be right.  She'll be some 34 year old rural suburban midwestern palin-loving jack-off with sagging tits and a community college degree in something like phys-ed and kids who drink and do drugs and screw around in high school just like she likely did.  (I don't remember a thing about her, I'm just assuming.)   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I fucking hate Americans.  I'm trying a new experiment.  I got a digital tape recorder, and I'm taping all my interactions with everyone now, 24/7.  Someday when I'm famous I'll maybe have an internet show where I go over the old tapes and make fun of these people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Who knows, maybe the yearbook girl is a hot lesbian now and she'll want to fuck me.  But probably not.  This is America after all, and we're all too tired and exhausted from working 60 hours a week to make the rich richer and to pay for our crappy health care (those few of us who have any health care) that all the lezzing out has pretty much fallen by the wayside.  Everyone turns now-a-days to the venomous vitriol of the inane right-wing to sustain their spirit.  How many lesbians have we lost to this wing-nut American mindset?  The mind boggles.  Fucking Vampire Americans. <br/> <br/> <br/>

      Don't be so dismissive of the common man.  Powerful forces have conspired to bring about this state of affairs.  Idealogical false dichotomies are one of their most powerful techniques.

      I don't think that Joe or Jane America really does know that things are terribly wrong.  They maybe have an intuitive twinge that some things aren't going well, but that's because for one thing things are going so badly that the mountain of evidence of things going badly is starting to landslide into the popular discourse, and also, common folk intuitively sense that things are going badly because life is getting harder and harder; e.g. working more and more for less and less.  But this intuition is not the same as knowing that things are terribly wrong.  If they really were capable of knowing that things are terribly wrong, they'd have known this quite a while ago, instead of gaining this sense only when things start to finally crash and burn with the economy and mounting evidence of global warming screwing us over and so on.  If we discover a new massive deposit of cheap oil somewhere, or if we get that laser fusion or whatever it is working to give us an unlimited supply of cheap electricity, then overnight all this knowledge that things are going wrong will evaporate as everyone will be too busy buying stuff at Walmart and Home Depot and eating out at fast food joints and driving around in new cars to have time to think about anything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know what ideas you subscribe to in the way of powerful and conspiratorial forces, but I suspect that we probably have different views in this arena.  The only powerful forces I see are low-level forces such as market forces.  If anything has screwed us over, it's not due to any conspiracy, rather, it's due to lack of conspiracy to counteract those forces of nature which like to drive populations towards the brink of chaos.  The rich and powerful are all basically some version of Madoff.. right place, right time, and not too smart.  The GOB club can't derive any conspiratorial success from secrecy because it's not secret.  Everyone knows it's there.  It's not there because it's special, it's there because the system creates it.  the GOB club is simply an emergent property of the system.  As the system of human culture changes, we will see new paradigms of organization, and strong centralized nodes such as GOB clubs will cease to be relevant.  When the power of the common man is finally unleashed via networked based culture, boy is this world going to be fucked.

      You're right, I way overstated the case with "terribly bad".  Your description of the common level of awareness is pretty accurate.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I say powerful forces, I don't mean some kind of majestic and awesome world overlords.  Of course there is pretty much nothing like that.  The powerful forces I refer to are more like the GOB club you mention.  But there are many, many GOB clubs.  Most are very much like the picture you paint: lucky and not too bright.  However, there is one group, or a couple of small groups that while no Einsteins, do have a good handle on a very old, very, very pernicious, and reasonably profitable, (for them!), scam.  Various groups have employed this scam on a more or less continuous basis for the last 400 or 500 years.  It saps the vitality of every society over which it holds sway.  It has destroyed the lives of tens of millions of people.  The United States struggled with it for the first 130 years of our existence.  We held our own, and became the richest nation on the planet, but the existence of the scam resulted in a non-stop parade of medium-sized financial catastrophes along the way.  Millions of people had their life savings wiped out.  Some even took their own lives in despair.  But we were holding our own.  Then, on December 24, 1913, we lost the war.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Its name: fractional reserve banking.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Huh?  All that build up for something so mild, so innocent sounding?!  Am I nuts?  Far from it.  It's not that complicated, but understanding how it benefits a tiny few at everyone else's expense requires some very careful analysis.  Read about the history of money.  "Oh, how boring."  "I don't want to do that."  That's what everyone says.  Another win for the powers that be...  All they have to do is stay under the radar.  Make sure that none of the major universities' economic departments ever start to actually practice science.  Occasionally, very, very, very, occasionally make sure that someone has an accident.  Do the names Lincoln and Kennedy ring a bell?  Nah!  That's just conspiracy crazy talk.  Well, the beauty of my thinking is that despite my suspicions, my suspicions need never rise above being anything else but suspicions.  I don't have to "prove" any conspiracy.  All I have to do is demonstrate to thinking people why fractional reserve banking is a bad idea.  If enough people acquire that understanding, then we put an end to it in this country.  Win.  For us! <br/> 
 <br/> 
P. S. I have a global warming rant too...  Simply this: It doesn't matter whether anyone believes in AGW or not.  In fact the powers that be love the argument over AGW.  Because as people argue over the existence or non-existence of AGW, NOTHING SIGNIFICANT WILL GET DONE.  I say to hell with AGW, I want to start tomorrow with a program of building: I want to cover the landscape with nuclear, solar, and wind power generation facilities.  I want the nation to abandon all of its other wars: the war on poverty, the war on terror, the war on drugs, whatever else.  I want to declare a war on carbon fuel powered energy production.  I want us to stop bickering like retarded children, sit down, and draw up plans to construct a completely new energy generation infrastructure that only uses sustainable sources such as the sun, the wind and the atom.  How long would it take to completely eliminate the need for coal and oil, at least here in the US?  (You gotta start somewhere.)  How much would it cost?  It will take how ever long it takes, PLUS HOWEVER LONG WE KEEP DITHERING BEFORE GETTING STARTED.  It will cost whatever it costs, PLUS HOWEVER MUCH MORE WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE NEEDED ENERGY TO BUILD IT BECAUSE WE DELAYED AND CARBON FUEL PRICES CONTINUED THEIR INEXORABLE RISE.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It'll never happen.  "We can't afford it."  "Eliminate all carbon?"  "That's nuts!"  Well, actually it will happen eventually, only by the time it happens, it will be way too late, so only one thousandth of the needed infrastructure will be built and millions of people will die. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unless, like you say, we get nuclear fusion, which may never happen, but even then, you have to build a lot of very expensive resource intensive power plants as well as a distribution system.  Not likely.  First the former middle class has to be bled dry of their last fifty cents.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What do you think?  Do you also want to eliminate the carbon cartel's tyranny? <br/>

      It's not like high school verbatim. But, being trapped, told what to do by people who seem to have lost touch with reality, failing at improving your situation by trying to think but succeeding purely by accident, getting many opportunities to have sex but only with the people you really don't want it from; No, it's not exactly like high school, but it gets the key points right.

      I'd have to agree with you, Streever. There's something that just doesn't click with me. Since the Chris Ware days, even. I liked the "Returning home" arc for Phillipe, but that's it.

      well, I thought the GOF and the wedding were kinda dumb too.  Lots of people went gaga over them, but I thought they sucked because they were all about social customs that I don't personally hold any interest in at all.  I was turned off by people liking GOF and Wedding because I think people liked these arcs because of the prestige and social standing associated with fighting and marrying. There was other stuff to like in these arcs, but I think this is the main reason most people identified with these arcs.  I think a major component of most people's psyche is shallowness and superficiality.  If people don't like the current arc, I can't help but wonder if it isn't in large part because their shallow-self isn't able to vicariously revel in some aspect of this strip.  People are asking for Phillipe to be brought into the arc... but why?  Are people attracted to Phillipe the person?  Or are they attracted to Phillipe the empty shell of a stereotype of a person, the cute little 5 yr old kid?  As you all get married to empty shells and have empty sex and raise empty shells of kids, are you ever going to be able to step outside of your prisons of social constructs?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is the reason that the current characters and the current arcs make some people so uncomfortable simply that these characters are outside of any social constrictions you normally recognize?  Isn't that why homeless people are so scary? <br/>

      If by "outside of any social constrictions you normally recognize" you mean "demented and dangerous" then you might be on to something but the real reason this story is making me uncomfortable is that it has been several week-long waits for a funny that turns out not to be a funny or even an interesting.

      We don't like this arc purely because the plotting & pacing are awful. I have enjoyed virtually all of Achewood to this point. Lately however he's just had some real stinkers. This and the latest Roast Beef/Cartiliage Head, for instance.

      It's not that it has changed. I mean, I enjoyed virtually every arc it's ever had until lately. It's just that the pacing and plotting of the latest arcs has been pretty awful. This arc will have been going on for 4 months before we know it. What if it went on for 6 months? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just because you have social disorders and are unable to enjoy things like "wedding references" and the great outdoor fight doesn't mean the rest of us are handicapped the same way. I'm perfectly capable of enjoying a broad spectrum of things because I care about the characters and the way the story is told. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, with this arc, the characters are not treated well by the author and are used to... to what end exactly? Bizarro patently fake regional accents that make no sense and seem designed to confuse--cliffhangers that don't ever resolve--a week between new strips--a few strange side characters that seem introduced purely so Nice Pete can kill them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Look, I loved the old strips with Nice Pete, even the one where he was going to kill Ray. The arc made me worry about Ray, was funny, and delivered consistently. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You should just accept that this arc is objectively poorly paced and plotted, instead of pulling out the pop psychology.

      So, let me try to wrap my mind around it. <br/> 
You're saying that we don't like this arc because we're too shallow or superficial to appreciate Teodor getting coerced (by physical torture, I might add) into blowing a stranger, or that I'm too shallow to appreciate characters that have as their one and only trait: A) Gayness (I shit you not, look for any other aspect about Nathan... He's fuckin' going to die, and he is trying to score a blowjob) or B) Homicidal psychosis (come on, do I even need to explain that one?) <br/> 
What's more, you aren't bringing forward any actual points about the strip that make it poignant, interesting, or even in some way redeemable. You're just pulling a "you're a buncha idiots" defense. Well, doesn't that fall directly into the realm of Ad Hominem?

Because there isn't one. It's just poorly paced and plotted. That's all there is to it. Maybe if the strips were delivered day after day it'd be better? Honestly I suspect even then it'd be pretty awful.

      I think what ratacattt is trying to say is that if we were half as elucidated as ratacattt we could enjoy this arc but we are doomed to a life of ignorance due to our very inability to see beyond our most immediate wants and needs.  I think it might be lonely up on that pedestal, so maybe we should try to be nice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personally I loved the GOF, I loved the wedding, and I also love this story arc.  The language play and the absurdism of this particular arc are the very things that made me fall in love with Achewood in the first place (Phillippe is standing on it).  The poignancy and character depth of the GOF and wedding were what sealed the deal (Roast Beef). <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you read Achewood and you cannot appreciate Nice Pete's monotone delivery of "running for the border" at 2a.m. and the way his pupils dilate when he says "NO," or how Teodor ended up in this incredibly ridiculous scenario wherein his salvation may very well be the ignorance of some 'chernchilla' raising cats who also happened to be the "math teacher" whose lawn he shat upon under duress.  The architecture of this plot, blending the completely deus ex machina sort of deal in with complete absurdity and wonderful language representation is precisely why I appreciate Onstad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hey i you guys disagree with me, that's cool.  The thing about opinions is that there really isn't a right or wrong.  I know I sometimes entertain the thought that anyone who does not enjoy the taste/smell of onions and garlic frying in butter must obviously be subhuman and not as enlightened as myself, but then I realize that I really don't give a fuck what other people like and passing judgment on it is a waste of my time because I doubt they give a fuck about what I think. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also: as a homeless person I ca say, homeless people are scary because they are unpredictable.  You don't know how much crazy they got going on under that hood, and anything unpredictable is naturally scary for a person.  If you didn't know if your car was fine or about to explode, it would be fucking sensible to be wary about entering it.  It is the mark of a halfway intelligent human being to be scared of a homeless man.  It is the mark of a decent human being to give the homeless man a chance at the risk of their self. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, ratacattt, you're fucking it up, man.  You're being a bag of dicks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cut that out.

      teezee that is exactly what I was trying to say only way more eloquent and sensible like.  Except for the part about me being a jaggoff.  I wasn't trying to say that.  I'm not really a jerk I'm just kinda aspergic.  I didn't have any kind of self-importance conceit going on when I penned the above.  I was just bein' honest.  Different people have different levels of awareness and consciousness.  Some people are more human than others.  some dogs are more human than some people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't have much dealings with homeless people but in any case I generally give hitch hikers rides and money if I got any.  Even people at the airport I give 'em money for bus fare or whatever.  Yeah, they might be scamming me, but they might not be too.  Why go through life assuming every homeless person asking for cash is scamming you.  Maybe they need it for  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101017235536/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBN1F5svuOA">to go get shot up with more and more needles</a> .  Maybe they need it to buy a book.  Ya never know.

      One thing he managed, Ratacattt, that you didn't, was to bring up some specific instances of why he enjoyed the arc. That's why we can talk nicely with him. Instead of lecturing us about our inability to read critically or properly enjoy something, he explained why he enjoys it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Instead of treating us to a 14 year old's understanding of pop psychology, he actually added something to the discussion and was intelligent. You may wish to investigate this.

      People are not "aspergic". You either have a diagnosis of some level of asperger's from a medical doctor in good standing, preferably a specialist, or you do not.  <br/>

Asperger's or jerk (or both). You're trying to squeeze past admitting personal faults by demanding the pity-shield society gives to disabled people.  <br/>

      being diagnosed with something and having it is not the same thing always. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For instance, you take your car to a qualified licensed and bonded mechanic who holds various industry standard certifications of mechanizational genius, and he says the dohickey in your car is diseased.  Well, he might be right, he might not be.  Alternatively, you don't take your car to said mechanic.  Again, the dohickey might or might not be diseased. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't want no pity.  I'm just saying, the reason I fucked your wife is I have aspergers.  I say this because I'm a sympathetic dude and I hope that this may help you to deal with the betrayal a little bit better because I sympathize with you.  Especially after having discovered what a lousy lay your wife is.  I sympathize.  cool?

While you are correct that a diagnosis is merely a confirmation of something that exists independently of it (or even something that does not exist at all), people with AS are hardly sympathetic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If we're gonna say we have  <em>conditions</em>  let us at least make do as if it were plausible.  I'm not saying you don't, or do, have whatever.  If anything, this is a corner of the internet where I am confident that you probably have  <strong>something</strong>  wrong with your brain.  An individual with A.S., in my experience, would just be confused you were upset at them sleeping with your wife, it would not occur to them that this would upset you although an explanation would make sense to them.

      No, he's just a dick who is defending his favorite comics ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do appreciate Nice Pete at 2 a.m., and I love the way he says No. Don't get me wrong: some of the installments in this arc were good. Overall though, it suffers from terrible pacing and what seems like a lack of direction. It's just wrong that teodor has been naked in a van for almost 4 months in real time and nothing substantiative has happened. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're really wrong about one thing though (in a polite way, which is good). Onions and garlic frying in butter is the best smell on earth, and if anyone disagrees with you they are most certainly subhuman.

      I would disagree. It started off well and was funny and interesting. It seemed to have an idea of where things were going right up until we got to the chinchilla house the first time. Then it stalled out for a while before getting back on track with the Denny's bit and now we're back to more nonsense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I could have forgiven a much smaller scene if it was to create the fire that would then pay off when Pete returned, but as it was Onstad focused too much on these hicks and it derailed the arc. Now we're derailed once again. Everything else that occurred was easily in line with "High School Night", but these digressions (and the long waits to even get them) don't have much to do with it and they lack intrinsic humor of their own. <br/>

In other words we want to see them get to the fireworks factory and we keep getting Poochie shoved into our faces like a 10-inch cat cock.

      No, but seriously: any strip with Nice Pete is automatically not my favorite.  (Guess what?  A one-note serial killer is  <em>not all that interesting!</em> )  An entire months-long arc where he essentially tortures Teodor is comedy heat-death.  Now there's...this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know what the hell to think any longer.  I get that there might not be anything to say about Roast Beef ( <em>is he depressed?</em> ) or Ray (is he a  <em>playa?</em> ) anymore, but this nonsense?  First the derailment of the sapphic erotica arc with an inexplicable Cartilage Head intrusion, then a series of middling arcs (Philippe going home didn't turn out nearly as well as it could have), and now...this bullshit? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I gave Onstad the benefit of the doubt with the Cartilage Head thing (hey, everyone makes mistakes!), but Jesus Christ, this is just fucking garbage.  Now there are no ideas at all; it's just sublimated bitching (look, Onstad's getting old!  look, Onstad's using Beef and Molly to vent about marriage!  look, Onstad doesn't like Whole Foods!) and pointless bullshit.  Christ almighty.

      You seem to think that Cartilage Head was an intrusion into the Sapphic Erotica arc. How do you know he was not the point of the whole arc to begin with? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, while it's generally good to be able to sum up a character in one word (so that you can identify the cast after reading only a few comics), the characters in Achewood are a bit more complex than the one word you gave. Which is also a good thing.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
You know how the reader can sometimes read more depth and meaning than the author intended? Any reader can make assumptions about what the author is thinking. One possible analysis for most works with depth is "sublimated bitching." But you should be suspicious when you can apply a simple analysis to everything, a red flag that perhaps the author in this case has something more complex in mind. Just as you should be suspicious when the analysis paints the author as a virtuoso of meaning but his work doesn't suggest he has that level of quality.

The fuckin' were closed Saturday, when I was absent from work due to illness... so I make an appointment on Monday for the following Tuesday to get a doctor's note excusing my absence due to illness...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I go in, they say the doctor is busy but I can see the nurse, they make me fill out all this paperwork and they order some lab work and they go through this big long appointment, I explain to them several times why I'm here, and only at the very end of it, they are like 'no we can't give you a doctor's note because you're not still sick.  You need to come see us when you're still sick.' <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm like.. what the fuck! you were closed! <br/> 
 <br/> 
My medical insurance allows me to change doctors once per month.  Time to try a new doctor.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
fuck the USA.  Man if I ever go postal I'm gonna make sure I kill some millionaires.  I understand we have a few of them in this country. <br/>

PS  your address on your web site is STILL WRONG.  I told you about it a month ago.<br/>
<br/>
It's RollingRidge Rd , not Rolling Ridge Rd.  Google maps can't find Rolling Ridge Rd, because it's ONE WORD, not TWO WORDS...  I hope you're more accurate than this in your medical records...  speaking of which...<br/>
<br/>
PPS - you left me in the room alone with your laptop unlocked and logged in.  This means I could have easily installed a rootkit on it.  You should secure your computer systems a little bit better than that...  Since there's no way of knowing what I did or didn't do to your laptop, the only way to guarantee that it isn't compromised now is to re-image it.  Great going.<br/>
<br/>
PPPS - great TV programming you have going on.  Keep up the great work, team!<br/>

      clearly onstad is sick of this shit so i hope achewood ends with teodor getting aids from the fag in the van and somehow spreading it to philippe and the next three months (aka four strips) has the gang sitting there in the hospital room watching them slowly waste away as mr bear sheds a tear for the first time in his life and they find roast beef dead from exhaust fumes in an idling ambulance outside in the garage, anything else would be a mockery of everything onstad has given us

      I have to agree; this is getting ridiculous. I understand this is a polarizing arc(and I am on the side that doesn't care for it,) but at this point everything that could be said seems to have been said. Now it's just people who don't like the arc reiterating their dislike over and over again (ttt2, overmedicated, rowboat, etc.) and those who do (or are just tired of the bitching) responding to each and every voice of dissent, often with non-sequiturs (ratacattt, whose name has the same number of Ts as tttt2. COINCIDENCE?) It's just a shit-flinging fight at this point (Although it could be argued that's not uncommon on assetbar.) <br/> 
Why don't we do what capslock reccomended and just wait for the next strip? <br/>

      Glad is a developing artist.  Someday, when he's famous, you'll be embarrassed that you made snarky comments about his work.  Either that or you'll talk a bunch of smack about the guy every time his name comes up, and all your friends, even the ones who basically agree with you, will wonder what your problem is.

      Hm.  Not sure what everyone is so upset about.  This arc has been a disturbing and uncomfortable nightmare from the first strip.  If this particular strip is any indication, things are only about to take a turn for the worse.  Makes sense to me.  Why don't we all just hang on for the ride and see where this all ends up before initiating such heinous bitching?

      Telling me to "hang on for the ride" just reminds me how long I've been standing here, hanging on, waiting for the ride to begin. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Speaking as someone who hadn't yet complained, I don't think the majority of complaints are about the discomforture caused by the strip. It has obvious weak points (the Nathan character motivated purely by penis-hunger) but, you know, it still has some style and a certain flourish. I think that it's realy only in the last few strips that we've started to feel the pinch of pacing - we're losing sight not only of where we began, but of Achewood generally. Does Ray even exist in Lurqilla's world? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess my thoughts come down to this: this is the kind of project you have to execute in a hurry. Just like ghost stories are best told in the dark, an arc like this doesn't benefit from having its individual moments sitting around for too long. Seeing each strip here for days on end as we check for the next update quickly robs them of their power, we start to resent them, and when the next update is equally cryptic, the resentment doubles. And so on. It's not like a self-contained joke we can just move on from once we've laughed. These strips are expecting our committment without promising anything in return. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus, I can't help but be reminded by it of the Philippe Kidnapped arc, which managed the same unsettling mood but did it timely and with restraint.

      it's difficult to maintain suspense when every panel must be hand drawn in a toddler-infested environment. <br/>

I've found that a lot of the arcs people complained about stand up much better if you go back and read them in one sitting. Do it right now, you'll be glad you did!

      ?  When did Onstad ever promise we would get a new strip every day?  Why does it have to be executed in a hurry?  The end product of the arc will be independent of the time taken to produce it.  There is no weekly quota that is required of a comic writer on his own website. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Achewood updates have been sparse for the past few years anyway.  It's something that we should expect.  Besides, the very first strip in this arc is hilarious (when Nice Pete appears in Teodor's window).  It is one of my favorite Nice Pete moments.  I love that it has gone to such a dark and uncomfortable place - not since the Philippe Kidnapped arc have the events been so unpleasant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Think about it this way: if this was the future (with the arc completed) and you were reading it for the first time, the time taken in between strips would be irrelevant to you.  It's like saying that Tool's albums suck because there is so much time in between the releases.

      I like to think that I would have started screaming back at him.  If he didn't leave I would have pelted him with toilet trout. I like to think that is what I would have done, but I probably would have done the same as you.  Thanks for warning me.  Now I am ready if some manage type ever fucks with me while I am using a toilet in a public place!  He'll be pelted, with wet Hershey snacks.

Seriously. If you were complaining about the content you paid for on the extra thing, I could understand that. But it's a website that he updates for free. You don't like it? You aren't paying for it, you don't have to read it.Send him an email or something if you think he should change his style, but bitching on a messageboard about it isn't really going to help much.

      Let me rephrase. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is a comic that he updates that you aren't paying for right now. If you don't like it, don't read it. Don't buy the book when it comes out. Find a way to criticize him that he actually reads (I'm fairly certain we've established he rarely reads these comments, haven't we? If not, apologies.) And I'm sorry if I was snippish, I'd been having a bad day, and it just really annoys me to see people just bitching about this when, let's be honest, it could be a hell of a lot worse. Even at its worst, Achewood is at least slightly interesting. Better than a lot of webcomics out there that are slightly interesting at their best, in my opinion.

      i think all great series/things should end on a note far removed from anything they are/were known for, so in keeping with that thought, achewood could totally end here and it would be one of my most hilariously treasured memories. <br/>

      You know something? If it took less than ten days to advance this rambling, uninspired arc, I could tolerate it. But I honestly cannot believe that this strip took ten fucking days to write. I believe Onstad is the funniest writer on the whole internet, but to wait ten days for a new strip and then get excited when it finally happens and then get this... <br/> 
It hurts me on a very deep, personal level. <br/> 
Why doesn't Onstad ever buy me flowers anymore? He doesn't even say hello when he gets home from work. He just sits down to watch professional wrestling and yells at me if there is no Jack Daniel's.
