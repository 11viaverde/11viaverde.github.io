      Based on the episode I saw he wants them to climb things and be really Christian while they do it too. Maybe I caught an off episode though. Maybe it was supposed to be about surviving the rapture or something, but I'm pretty sure it was Argentina. Hard to tell though.

      i was a long time sufferer of gladiator addiction.  their golden shields and sharp spears and swords-glinting in the sunlight-drew me in to their world of carnage and violence.  years later i would realize that my gladiator addiction stemmed from a lack of violent images in my childhood, and that the simple act of watching the movie  <em>300</em>  was a sufficient cure. <br/>

my name is Andrew, and I used to be a Glatiataholic.  i am currently ten months sober.

      Man, I feel the need to point out that a spellchecker would have solved nothing, as "quick" is also a valid word. Unless you meant just checking your post. Which you probably did. I only rely on spellcheck because I am WEAK.

      Your child may well be enthralled by retellings of  <em>U-571</em>  and  <em>We Are...Marshall</em> , and such accounts may teach them valuable lessons about determination and perseverance (though I would recommend against actually showing your child the former for its violent content). However, avoid covering films like  <em>The Wedding Planner</em>  and  <em>Dazed and Confused</em>  until your child starts asking those awkward prepubescent questions a few years down the line.

      You and mysterymeat001 imply the character point this strip underscores: Teodor has become Philippe's de facto father.  The other fellows chip in with editorial duties and online security and such, but for better or worse T has the largest hand in bringing up the little shaver. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What T doesn't seem to've considered is how he can make this work for him.  Lonely as he is he should be setting Philippe up for play dates with the rich kids from Achewood Heights and making time himself with their au pairs.

      From an early age, try to introduce gladiators slowly into the childs life. Denying them of gladiators entirely will only help provoke interest in them, as a sort of "forbidden fruit". They need to understand that while gladiators can be fun and useful for overcoming inhibitions, gladiator abuse and gladiator addiction can have severe consequences. It can also help if the family has a glass of gladiator with meals.

      I spent four years volunteering as a counsellor for Gladiator Addiction during my free time. Those were some long, cold nights... when I think of that time I always think of Keith. Clean and sober for six months, not one oiled bicept, not a solitary leather kilt. we all thought the days of concealed tiger pits and (at best) rudimentary stadium seating arrangements were behind him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then Ridley rolled into town. You all remember how it was, everyone all representing for Ancient Rome and suddenly what we did in this life echoed in eternity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I got a call from Keith that weekend, asked me to meet him in a diner downtown. Soon as I got there, him and this new trick got up from their table. Seems they were eloping. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I've been dying to tell someone! This is Bruximus..." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Huh. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I ran into Keith a few weeks back. he looked well, all things considered; I didn't ask where "Bruximus" was. A year on the half back on the wagon, kid on the way and everything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wish him all the best.

      I have a mayor plant in my town, and things have never been better. Fallout is unlikely, thanks to safety procedures, and the cheap stream of mayors has caused our local economy to catapult upwards. The fallout that does occur is rarely low enough to cause any damage over a lifetime even. We suffer more from celebrity fallout than mayor fallout. (Goddamn fame-burning plant.) <br/>
