      Oh, I don't know.  I remember watching the first episode of the animated Clerks when it aired, and thinking "oh god please cancel this now!" and lo did the gods decree.  I compare my watching that first episode to watching pretty much any episode of Robot Chicken (except the Star Wars one, maybe).  Kevin Smith has basically made one, maybe two good movies, when will people comb their souls and accept this?  Maybe I'm just being a prick because I had a roommate in college who was a Kevin Smith occultist.

      Oh, it is silly to be a Kevin Smith occultist, although I do like most of his movies I've seen, especially the original clerks.   <br/>

<br/>
For several years following the series' cancellation, Smith has announced plans to make a straight-to-DVD film. The basic plot involved Dante and Randal making a movie about their lives at the Quick Stop, a reference to the production of the original film. As of September 2007, the status on the project is unknown. In a recent interview Kevin Smith expanded on the delays surrounding the film. Apparently, when Harvey and Bob Weinstein left Miramax, owned by Disney, the split was not completely amicable. The rights to the Clerks television show are still owned by the Disney Corporation, who as a result are reluctant to work with The Weinstein Company, throwing the future of Clerks: Sell Out into question.[citation needed] At the 2007 Cornell Q/A Kevin said due to the Miramax/Weinstein argument "you will see a Jay and Silent Bob cartoon before Clerks: Sell Out."</em></div> <br/> 
Nevermind about that movie thing.  Sorry to get your hopes up, Assetbar.

      I think the biggest issue and a major part of it being cancelled was that they showed the second episode without showing the first. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem?  The second episode was a flashback episode.  To the first episode. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hilarious in theory, and was somewhat hilarious in practice, but the high-sugar low-attention-span tv-watching public today aren't patient enough to put the effort in when they are missing half the jokes due to not seeing the first episode. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or most people thought it was shit.  Whatevs, man.

      In sex education, one of our teachers cajoled another teacher (via the medium of the muttered conversation) into pointing out that it wasn't a good idea to use a crisp packet as a prophylactic. <br/>

You could tell the second teacher was highly unconvinced that we needed told this, and that he thought the first teacher was a right stupid cow for making him come out with this nonsense in front of a bunch of kids. <br/>

How about Arthur Bostrom as Officer Crabtree? He's suppose to be a Brit who thinks he can speaks French well but can't. His accent and vowel colorings really nailed a bad British accent in French - but he was speaking English! I've always been impressed. <br/>

On the other hand, the American with a British wife in an episode of Fawlty Towers doesn't even half way pass as American.

Are you talking about McNulty the character doing a shit British accent, or the actor (as a Brit) doing an awful Baltimore accent? <br/>

      Yes, Dominic West's baltimore attempt isnt great, whoever played Stringer Bell did a better job. I have to agree with Leshat Botty that Van Dyke is in a different league of awfulness from Cheadle who I initially thought might be english, but not cockerney. Do you mean Carcetti(sp?). Oh yeah I remember him from Queer As Folk now you mention it.

      I still think Cheadle's worse - I've seen other Londoners react physically to his attempt at speaking.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cock Truck Lezza was off, but he fit the general campiness of Mary Poppins (must admit, I get it mixed up with Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang). I would say it was a more innocent time, when LSD was still legal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And yes! It's Carcetti. Thank you for pointing that out.  <br/> 
Tommy Vercetti is the main character in GTA Vice City. How foolish of me (though he was voiced by the lovely Ray Liotta).

I thought that the premise was weak, the songs were corny, the moral to be ham-fisted and that a sixth digit was coming out of the palms of my hands, giving it a talon-like quality.

      I swear I once heard him drop an "r".  The only issue with Laurie, and it's not even an issue, just a thing I notice, is it's completely accentless to Americans.  It's basically non-regional, but all actors do that, which annoys me.  I think if you've got a setting, try and pretend for our sake you belong there.  As a person with a decently thick accent, it's important to me. <br/>

      Not completely accentless. It is not a Western accent, nor a purely Eastern accent, and it's sure as hell not Southern. But I've heard Western Pennsylvanians and Eastern Ohioans with this accent. It's tending toward neutral, but still East of the Mississipi.

      Maybe this is what Brits think of as the neutral American accent. I remember being complemented on my attempt once, but being told that it was sort of located somewhere around Chicago. Then again, maybe I just sounded like Sean Connery in the Untouchables.

      If you were addressing me: <br/> 
Well, you're not an actor on TV.  I just think it adds to the character.  Just makes them a bit more believable, because more often than not, a person has at least a twinge of an accent, and shows tend to take place in areas prone to rich accents.  I think it's potential squandered.  Basically what I'm saying is I want TV to be more like Krazy Kat, which isn't much of a crime.  Probably only a misdemeanor. <br/>

      I  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109185644/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua8qk1VJ#comment_648">unignored</a>  you after many people objected, "Don't ignore Lone Al, he's really a nice guy!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Please note, though, that the original ignoring was due to what I described at the time as an "attempt to disguise racism as irony."  This was distasteful to me for two reasons: <br/> 
 <br/> 
First, the casual use of an anti-Italian slur was a bit grating.  It hasn't been all that long since discrimination against  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109185644/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Italianism">Italians</a>  (or  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109185644/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Irish_racism#19th_century">Irish</a> , for example) was commonplace in the US.  I have a feeling you probably wouldn't use, say, an anti-black slur, and you probably don't hang out with people who do.  Using an anti-Italian slur is categorically the same thing, though, with the only difference being that a bit more time has passed since Italians were common victims of discrimination. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Secondly, using said slurs in a faux-ironic context is an insult to irony itself.  I've lived long enough to no longer be shocked by prejudice, but when you offend  <em>irony,</em>  that's when it gets personal.  My whole generation is based upon irony, dammit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
With regard to the abortion topic at hand, I agree with all of those pleading to not start that debate here.  Abortion is such a polarizing issue, with people at both ends of the spectrum honestly believing that their particular point of the view is the morally correct one, that internet debates about it tend only to create animosity.  I've already seen in some of the messages above that people with whom I happily interact on this forum, people with whom I share an affinity for an irreverent comic strip, have opposing views on abortion.  So far, they've found Acheworld to be a uniting phenomenon.  I fear that after a typical abortion debate, this forum would be a divisive phenomenon.  And that would be a shame.

      Ohmigod ohmigod, I do not mean for people to keep writing essays at me. I just wanted to trash an episode of House, I do not have any desire to actually talk about abortion and even less desire to talk about racism against white people. You really don't have to link to proof that you unignored me, it is not a big deal. I like reading what you write regardless of if you like reading what I write, and we can disagree about the oppression which I have had to bear as a person of Irish descent.

      As an American who lived in England for several years and has an English wife...I would say that Hugh Laurie is mostly convincing, but there are some words he says that come out sounding slightly Canadian believe it or not.  I found from my time in England that English folks have trouble hearing the difference between American and Canadian.  Which is fair enough considering most Americans think English people sound like Hugh Grant. <br/> 
What Hugh Laurie does very well is capturing the flat monotone of American English.  English people use tone and inflection to get additional meanings across...Americans do not (generalizing of course).

If for some masochistic reason you actually wish to communicate with this wretch, do it over AIM or something. I guarantee you will regret it.

      You'd be a fool to do it! But I'll be happy if you pay me to keep talking to you. (Wink, wink. Nod, nod.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, I've got no motivational DVD. I've got no desire to make one. There are others far better at it, who actually think we need to fix something or get somewhere. <br/> 
 <br/> 
How can you fix what is not broken? Where is there left to go when you are already everywhere? Don't worry if it makes no sense, but ponder and inquire "what does it mean?" and we'll talk later. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Classic, typical, normal way of being human that yields limited results: You already know, so why think more or ask if it might be different today then yesterday?

      Metalocalypse is terrible. In the first season, it felt like it was two good for an eleven minute program, but not good enough for a twenty two minute program. In the second season, it felt like they were trying to cram twenty two minute plots into an eleven minute program, and episodes will end without anything really happening. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've noticed that Brendon Small's idea of humor is to have a bunch of people sitting around talking about nothing. It wasn't too bad in the first season, but it came in full force for the second, and it was the reason why the two part season finale was two parts. A friend described it to me as "Metalocalypse doesn't even have jokes." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another problem with it. I understand and apperciate that the show is primarily about a bunch of idiots who cause mayhem, but it'd be nice if they did just a little more to advance the main plot. At least drop a hint here or there. What's worse, the show can be really awesome when it chooses to be. The first season finale was kick ass despite being eleven minutes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I speculate that Metalocalypse's popularity can be traced to three factors: First, people like the references to Metal. Second, the violence, which is a pretty appealing part of the show. Third, on the surface the animation seems better than what Adult Swim usually churns out, but it's actually not anymore fluid than the rest of the shows.

      Funny, seems like we just had a discussion where people were defending Achewood for not having 'jokes' and deriding those simple-minded folk who can only enjoy humor with clear punchlines. I'm pretty sure much of it can also be described as people sitting around talking about nothing.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Did you also hate Home Movies? That had even less of a plot and more talking. What you see as a weakness is the main reason people like Brendan Small - the accurate portrayal of awkward, meandering dialogue. Except in Metalocalypse, the humor also comes from the individual personalities of the characters. Basically anything Toki says is gold. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The metal references don't hurt though.

      The comparison fails because Achewood actually has unique dialog, regardless of whether there's a clear punchline. Home Movies and Metalocalypse don't have near the wit of Achewood. With them, we get things like two scientists trying to decide who gets to describe their new water based recording technique first, and the whole exchange takes up 1/3 of the episode. Awkward meandering dialog? Yeah, I'll stick with something that actually tries to be clever instead of lazy.

      Man, people just don't get Squidbillies, do they?  Is it that they see it's about a bunch of hillbilly squids talking with southern accents and assume it's stupid?  Because I can't see how you can watch the show (especially if you like other Adult Swim shows, e.g. Space Ghost and ATHF especially) and not think it's at least kind of funny. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not trying to be a prick here, I really am curious as to what you don't like about it.  Personally, I think its writing and animation are both surprisingly clever and well done (both seem crass at first, and can be so, but there's a lot of subtlety in there), and the voice acting is fucking incredible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I live in the South (only a few hours from those North Georgia mountains) but am not a southerner by birth, so I have a pretty balanced view of the South. <br/>

      I hate the animation, for one.  I get that it is supposed to be ugly, but it's just very distracting for me.  The only episode I saw was the one where the squid-son was going to prom, and his grandmother and...older woman with a wig offered to have sex with him.  It just seems like cheap humor, cheaper than Space Ghost, at least. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also don't like the whole "South = Incest and Dumb People looool" brand of jokes, just a personal preference.  Maybe it's because I have never had anything to do with the South other than really liking the movie Slingblade.  Maybe I'd appreciate it more if I knew what a Piggly Wiggly was.

      There were these two fellars standin' on a bridge, a-goin' to the bathroom. One fellar said, "The water's cold" and the other fellar said, "The water's deep". I believe one fella come from Arkansas. Get it?

      Thanks for the reply, I appreciate it.  I've met a few people who often like a lot of the other shows by ex-Space Ghost writers (mostly the Dave Willis/Matt Malliero ones), but rarely do they like Squidbillies, but most admit to barely watching it and can't explain why they don't like it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can see the initial reaction to the animation being a dislike due to it's purposeful "ugliness," but there's a lot of subtle animation in the characters themselves (the movements of the tentacles, the faces, and well, just all of Dan Halen). <br/> 
 <br/> 
The "Rusty gets home schooled" ep is one of my favorites, actually (and, for the record, the grandmother and the older woman, her daughter, wind up making out together; they only really politely ask to dance with the grandson/nephew).  I guess I've never seen those kind of jokes as "incest jokes" on this show, just the kind of debased and distorted opportunism that pervades everyone in the show.  But that's me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's as much of a love letter to those sons of the soil as it is a kick in the groin.  Dave Willis and a number of the other guys on the show grew up in Georgia, even out in the country, so, unfortunately, it's not just some misguided Northerner's equally ignorant perception of the South that informs this show, it's kind of real life.  Makin' them hillbillies is just another way Willis et al to make extreme, crass jokes (and work in some of their own personal history) in a deceptively smart way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I dunno, I guess I can't help but think that calling it a bunch of cheap "Southerners r stoopid lulz" jokes is as much of an oversimplification as calling Achewood a collection of cheap weed and cock jokes; both like to revel at times in stupid/crass humor, but it hardly defines them.  Aqua Teen's Carl is great send-up of a stereotypical Jersey-ite (and NYer), but there's a lot more to him than just some 2 dimensional Howard Stern fan caricature.  Those ex-Space Ghost guys have become increasingly good at making smart shows look stupid (a la Beavis & Butthead, but even better). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Alright, I hope I don't sound like I'm trying to belittle you here, I ain't.  I've watched too much fucking TV, dammit...but at least most of the shows are only 11 mins long.  That's a plus...right?

      Haha, well yeah, maybe you're right.  I didn't give the show much of a chance, and I do just sort of cast it off as a simple "Southland People's Sure Do Suck!" kind of thing.   I'll give it another shot next time it comes on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But if I'm disappointed, I'll have YOU at my desk tomorrow morning along with the creators of the show.  Good opportunity to meet them, at least!

      I can't say any and every ep is gonna lead to an epiphany, but I recommend watching the "Office Politics Trouble" episode (or as I called it above, the "Glug" episode), which, despite have a pretty damn constant run of funny jokes (incest included), harkens back to the old Dave Willis ridiculously-complicated-plot-for-limp-dick-pay-off-in-the-best-way-possible-quality, akin to the first MC Pee Pants and Cybernetic Ghost eps on Aqua Teen. <br/>

      I uaed to enjoy Squidbillies, but I find that it now mostly relies on weirdness for weirdness sakes. Some episodes have even left me wondering whether they were even trying or whether they just wrote the script to be done with it.

      I agree that "terrible" may be going a bit far, but part of my hate comes from how much potential I think the show has. Let me note that I wouldn't have felt motivated to give that rant, except those were thoughts that I've been wanting to put down for awhile.

A while ago, a certain poster suggested that a punchline that had mentioned use of percosettes, (in a most incidental of ways, mind you),was "not funny, not cool, not a good strip". Since then, the phrase had been briefly used to convey ironic indignation over petty things.

      <em>Xavier</em>  was pretty great before they yanked it.

Anyway, it wasn't nearly as ridiculous as the other switch they made around the same time -  <em>Darkplace</em>  replaced by  <em>The Oblongs.</em>  Fucking  <em>scandalous!</em>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, and if anyone here says that they have never at least cracked a smile at  <em>Tim and Eric,</em>  well, you're fucking lying. Stop lying.

      Ages ago I stumbled on something called Space Ghost Coast to Coast on the internet. It used to have Adult Swim logos on it. So this is a TV channel? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really liked SGC2C, and if anyone disagrees I'll say it's because the internet filtered out the less good episodes. And also I'll say  <em>you go to jail!</em> .

      Man,  <em>Space Ghost</em>  started it all! Still one of the best. It was the first foray (that I know of) into the idea of taking stills from old cartoons, reanimating them and adding funny/surreal voice-overs. It led to many great spin-offs, the best of which, in my opinion, being  <em>Sealab 2021.</em>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Adult Swim isn't a channel in and of itself. It's just what the Cartoon Network turns into late at night. It used to be, like, once a week. Then, once they realized that it was basically the only good thing on the entire channel, they just started showing it every night. It was smart of them. A lot of good things have come out of it.

      Man, I remember when I first dared to watch Adult Swim, when they had the actual Adult Swim theme going, with the fat people in the pool.  It was "Space Ghost" and that crazy show "O Canada" or whatever it was called, with all the weird Canadian animation.  I was like "This...is  <em>art</em> ."

      I remember "Late Night Black & White"!  I used to stay up to watch that and Space Ghost, along with the old Jon Stewart Show (the syndicated one, post-MTV. it lasted about a year).   <em>*sigh*</em> .  You have made me nostalgic for simpler, more innocent times.  Everything was new and the humor was gold.

      Pretty much.  All the "commentary" episodes on Kentucky Nightmare only make it even better.  How did it go?  First they aired the producers' mom's commentary, and then the producers' commentary on the producers' moms' commentary.  The reason I loved SGC2C (and the 2 best efforts by the main crew behind it, Aqua Teen and Squidbillies) is their extreme devotion to surrealism and, really, almost daring you to watch the show.

      Space Ghost is  <em>old</em> .  It predates Adult Swim a lot.  I remember watching it when I was 10.  I mean the talk show, not the 60s cartoon.   <br/> 
Adult Swim brought back Family Guy and Futurama(kinda) from hiatus. <br/>

Most of the shows, however, scare me.  My brother is a huge fan though. <br/>

      It was on UPN for five episodes. They cancelled it and adult swim aired the first season through. They ended up funding three more seasons after that. So even though it didn't start on [as] they deserve some credit.  <br/>

this season has been a little disappointing, but it's not because it's become too repulsive.  Anyone interested, I think the best thing Tim and Eric have ever done was the Nite Live series.

      Venture Bros. = 11 kinds of awesome (Klaus Nomi and Iggy Pop as David Bowie's henchmen, for a start, and about sixty thousand other things).  Metalocalypse--not bad.  ATHF & Robot Chicken amuse me for reasons I cannot express eloquently (usually some kind of mood-altering substance comes into play, though they amuse me sober sometimes too).  Sealab and Frisky Dingo have their moments, as well.  Most of the rest leaves me cold. <br/>

Bold of Onstad to poke at the Adult Swim.  Seems like it'd be a natural next step, as Achewood climbs the ladder of pop-cultural awareness. <br/>

      I like the idea that the vagina is such a complicated and confounding little thing that it requires SO MANY tools that, by sheer probability alone,  <em>at least</em>  one of them will be useful. It's like a really fancy dinner, with a million types of salad forks and butter spoons and whatever. Whereas, to keep the metaphor running, if a dude's junk were to be compared a meal, the only tools he'd really need were his hands and a close proximity to the sink.

      Hi guys, Assetbar admin here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We too, are tired of the jerks, so we rolled out a new feature last night to stop jerks, trolls and douches dead in their tracks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In short, we've added a community powered Jerk Identification Algorithm that banishes jerks to a global ignore list according to the <br/> 
wishes of YOU the fine achewood community members.    <br/> 
 <br/> 
This JIA should enable the community to more easily stop jerks from  <em>being themselves</em> .  So keep chubbying, laming and ignoring, and you'll see that your personal ignore list <br/> 
(https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/ignore_list)  <br/> 
expands to include jerks you didn't have to add yourself.  In case you disagree with the <br/> 
community, you can always remove anyone from your ignore list too.

      I still say that would have worked had we promoted more, and could still work.  A couple dozen lames on people who engage this idiot and pretty quickly they are down to one post a day, which I doubt they want to waste on remote-control group therapy.  Requires discipline, though.

      Precisely.  It is merely the common-sense maxim "Do Not Feed the Troll" backed with the mob rule enforcing mechanism of the lame system.  But it has never gained critical mass, and someone always has to reply to this guy.  Just caaaaaan't leave it alone.

      I just think that everyone getting all serious and having a 'strategy' will itself perhaps risk giving the troll that magical squirmy feeling in the pants. Much simpler just to ignore and scroll past responders.  <br/>

      Dear sirs: <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really see that many will find this helpful to their experience here. I greet it with much less enthousiasm. I don't desire to have any part of the community censored from my view. Two requests: One, is it possible to make an option on our profile to opt out of the new feature, if we so desire? Two, what will it take for me to set my "hide comment for lames" number to 300? I've never been able to move it from 3, and it is a great annoyance to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While I have your attention, many have experienced a dearth of chubbies in the more extended comment threads of this strip. Would it be possible to get more chubbies to give as the number of comments goes up? Finally, it would be nice to be able to generate a report similar to the inbox that would let you see which of your posts received chubbies and lames? Such a thing would likely promote more of the behaviors that generate rewards.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I recognize that these may be unreasonable requests, and appreciate your considering them anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thank you.

      I like these suggestions too. Please look into as much as lechatbotte said. Also I'd add a "sort by" feature to the comments section, which would allow us to see our replies by date. Maybe a nesting feature, too, to reflect the layout of assetbar itself and make viewing simpler.  <br/>

      Lech, with all due respect, you haven't been around long enough to properly evaluate the troll. When you get death threats and have pictures of your face pasted on to people having sex with bugs, then maybe I will listen to you about "censoring" the "community."

      You've left me in a quandry.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have to admit I really get the humor of what you have written here. I laughed much harder than I would like to admit to, and then felt immediately guilty due to really liking Loneal, and finding reprehensible your suggested course of action towards her, no matter how in jest you meant it. I wanted to lame and chubby you at the same time.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Topsy, AIU, hey you, or whoever you are, you have a well developed, if unruly, sense of humor. There is also a huge amount of "Look at me, pay attention to me, love me, hate me, just don't ignore me" going on. Which is fine. It is a valid human way of living. But I can guarantee you that you will never really find any lasting joy, peace, happiness, connection, intimacy or acceptance coming from that space. I really get that you don't believe that anything can make a difference in those areas. You are resigned that the best your life can offer is to gadfly and bait and hinder and annoy perfect strangers in the comment stream for a better than average web comic for the attention. It's as close to connected as you can imagine. And you are good at it. Like I say, there's nothing wrong with that. It just won't ever give you the real things you deserve and crave. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, I've come to a decision. Out of love for you, and a hope for a breakthrough in the areas of resignation and cynacism, I am simply going to pay no attention to you when you cross the line. The post I'm responding to is such a case. There have been over the past few days a number of useful and enjoyable posts from you. These I will allow to exist in my world, and will respond to and interact with. I won't ignore you. I won't be one of the first three to lame you. (Although if I find it truly lame, I will be happy to lame you after the third one.) I just simply won't feed you when you cross the line. That's all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I will continue to be a pull for you to have a full, authentic life that works. And I will continue to enjoy your better momments when you aren't posing and posturing. The you I've seen in those momments I quite like and am glad to know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really hope you will make it possible for us to continue conversing frequently.

Topsy, or whatever you prefer to be called: You have written a cogent, thoughtful and heartfelt response. It has touched, moved and inspired me in ways I did not expect, and it was completely appropriate. (Whoever lamed you deserves to die the death of the JIA for basically not giving a crap.) I need a little time to parse it fully, and will give a fitting response to it soon. Entre-temps, I will visit the suggested site. Be back with you soon!

      I actually work in a clinic specialising in the rehabilitation of those who have suffered from troll attacks. I'm just cleaning staff, to be fair, but I've still heard stuff that would make your hair drop through your head and knock your teeth out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This one guy I heard about, just in the wrong place at the wrong time, was grabbed by a gang of particularly vicious bridge trolls. They tore off his arms and legs, cauterised the wounds with wood from their fire, and then managed to barbeque him for about five or six minutes before the authorities arrived. Seems they enjoyed the sound of human screams while they cooked. I'm not sure how they managed to stop him passing out after the dismemberment. Maybe one of their weird troll potions. <br/>

Yeah, trolls are serious business.

      Loneal, you are the only one who can call me that and have it arrive as a laugh instead of a rankle. (For the rest of you, it is Le Chat Botte', Le Chat or just Chat, PLEASE!) <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really get that our resident troll has been a particular nuisance for you. I'm sorry that has been your situation. I am continually grateful to have you as part of the community. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I may seem a newbie to human nature, and I may not have received the "pleasure" of posts such as you describe. I'm unconcerned about such possibilities. If 99% or better of the community are oblivious to older incarnations, there will be limited appeal in using them. So, frequent new incarnations will be the result, new ones that everyone will see anyway. That is what it is.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am committed to being a space where everyone can be heard, no matter how trivial, trifling or rude. This communal ban is powerful, and will have benefits for the community. But I wish to have the power to opt out, consistent with my position. Being able to unignore is useful, but only really works if I know when someone has been added to my exclusion list. There is no such automatic notification, nor can I imagine a way to make one easily. A passive opt out is more efficient. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, this isn't about "censoring" the "community", it is about  <em>my view</em>  of the community being uncensored. I have become the person I am by always keeping my ears and eyes open. I do not want outside imposed barriers to my view. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said, if there are only a handful of us that can see the ghost like presence of the troll, it is likely that greener pastures will be found. I also request that y'all let me know if I seem to be talking to myself. That would be bad etiquette.

      It was a complete contrivence on the part of the writers. But it gave us an incredible visual of something as big and solid as a large house being destroyed by the collective efforts of a lot of small, individually insignificant kernals of corn, simultaneously depriving the villian of the rewards of his villany, and making a great thematic statement.

      The people who work in popcorn factories end up with all sorts of ailments in their lungs from inhaling the chemicals used to make it. Your friends who hate the smell of popcorn are probably just a bit further on the evolution scale than the rest of us, more finely attuned to the natural threat of toxic venom that kills you painfully from the inside out.

      I heard about a guy getting popcorn lung because he would sniff the inside of a bag of popcorn each time he made it. I was curious as to whether this was worth it, and I figured that I'd be safe because the guy ate several bags a day, so I thought that once wouldn't be too harmful. So I made a bag, opened it, shoved my face in and inhaled. <br/>

      hi Assetbar admin <br/> 
would it be possible for there to be some mechanism for informing the account holder of when they have been globally ignored?  At that point there is no more use in continuing to use the account to make posts.  I find myself having to register a new account several times a day just to look at the ignore list of the new account to see if my regular account has been globally ignored, given that the account holder does not show up on their own ignore list even when globally ignored.  This creates a lot of extra accounts in your system.  Also the thingy that blocks your IP from registering too many new accounts is annoying; I have to reboot my DSL modem, and eventually all the IPs in my ISP's DHCP pool will get blocked.  What do I do then?  What does someone else on my ISP's DCHP pool do if they want an account? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Other 'n that, I find it odd that my present account hasn't been globally ignored, since that seems to be the new thing to do -- to ignore me regardless of what I post, without regard for how my posting may be evolving.  But whatever.  I'm hanging in there.  I resent that this is going to force me to become a more subtle troll, but I will try my best to adapt.  Remember assetbar, I am in every shadow of a doubt.

      That's no yoga position. Laying the injured on their side and bending the topmost leg up is essential in the healing process of a punctured Rectus sheath.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Although, Beef should really be bending both of Ray's knees up. He's doing a really good job considering he only has Vagina Products to patch Ray up with.

      tampons are really useful, actually. this one time at work i was cleaning the bathroom when i accidentally knocked over a bucket of water. frantic, i threw every absorbent item i could find at the spreading puddle. soon i was out of paper towels and toilet paper, and desperately searching the shelves, my eyes caught upon a box of tampons. i threw five or six of them on the floor like grenades and watched them expand, successfully sucking up huge amounts of the water. <br/>

i thought it was a good idea, but my manager was pretty fucking mad at me.

      Properly, It's Botte' with an accent on the e. Accents and BBCode = not a happy combination. <br/>

There's a fairy tale that has two names in French: "Le Maitre Chat" ("The Master Cat") and "Le Chat Botte'" ("The Booted Cat"). The normal English for this story is "Puss in Boots". <br/> 
 <br/> 
And now (in the voice of Antonio Banderas) I will teach you how to say it: leh shaw bow-TAY (with the bow being as in bow tie not as in bow wow). <br/>

      There's something else to worry about, HPV getting in your mouth, later giving you throat or tongue cancer.  Read an article about it recently.  Oral sex can give you throat cancer!  Too late for me, but maybe some of you younger ones can be saved.

Nah, I just don't think Tina is our kind of dick seeing as she lashes out at most people's most beloved character for no apparent reason. Does she think she can come storming back into everyone's lives, being an abrasive jerk? We barely know her! Lyle has been doing it in an old-school way since the start, Pat is the guy we love to hate, and Todd is just ridiculous. Plus they're all friends with the rest of the main cast, which means they've accepted each other's behaviour somewhat, and so we accept them too. Basically I think people accept a character's behaviour based on how often they're in the comic.

      Agreed, I think part of the problem with Tina is that she doesn't have any established character traits other than abusiveness.  Ramses Luther Smuckles, for example, was a cock to many strangers during the wedding arc, but readers excused that as reasonable behavior for a reclusive GOF legend.

      Tina is not a dick in any interesting way. She is basically Ray's most annoying tendencies without any of his redeeming qualities. Nor is she annoying in an extreme and idiosyncratic way like Pat. She's just a run-of-the-mill hoochie mama who dates the kinds of guys that buy magazines about car stereos. Please, I am from New Jersey, I do not need to be exposed to any more of this.

      I prefer Tina, too.  She's got a personality, while Molly has pretty much just been a happy-go-lucky, agreeable foil since whenever she first appeared.  That has it's place, but I think Tina has more  <em>comic</em>  potential. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, if I we were doing some sort of slash fiction, I'd be Ray & Tina.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I'd much prefer to hang out with Tina.  I like women who are popularly considered bitches.  Molly's a one-trick pony, she's going to agree with you and then talk about something pleasant.  Tina might just pull your hair and scream in your ear.  It's exciting.

      Honestly, Molly is nothing short of a wish fulfillment. Most guys dream of, but do not get, a supportive nearly always reasonable and agreeable woman who cooks for them and thinks they are sooo right on.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If we didn't all feel sorry for and like Roast Beef so much, we wouldn't put up with her at all. But, since we do, we love her for "getting" him and taking care of him. <br/>

      Did you guys forget about all the arguments they have where Molly wants a normal conventional life contrary to Beef's desires, all wanting kids and trying to make him wear 'nicer clothes'? Screw all that nonsense. MY fantasy woman just makes delicious sandwiches and talks to me about Sartre.

      Yeah, but those arguments always just seem like a vehicle for Beef to say something funny in response, not really a characteristic of Molly.  <br/> 
  Which is fine by me, it works well and all, but it could've just as easily been Ray arguing with Beef that he and Molly should start having kids soon after the marriage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or Teodor saying he should trim his junk to make it more fun to look at! <br/> 
 <br/> 
In terms of actual possibility of interesting character developments, Tina strikes me as more likely to spur off a funny arc than Molly would. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Molly is a foil; as quality as a foil gets, and that's her role in the comic.  We've yet to really see where/if Tina will fit in.

      Now, an addendum: I had forgotten all about the blogs during that post.  Remembering them, I recollect Molly having a fairly defined personality.  So, I do concede that she does in fact have character, it just seems we rarely see it in the actual comic.  Then again, where exactly would it fit?  I'm happy with the dynamics as is; I just think Tina could create some funny situations, at least for a few strips.

      It's also probably best to read the blogs by going through the strips via assetbar and finding xiaomimi's blog/strip synch-up posts.  If you just go through and read the blogs as is (and not in relation to the strips/other blogs going on at the time), it won't be anywhere near as rewarding.

      I will heed this advice. My first time thru the archive, I first thought she was making the names up, and it didn't always make a good punch line. Then I got they were links to something/somewhere. Then I got that they were actually Onstad. But I was too far down to pick it up. <br/>

      Is it just me or does something about the last panel remind you of Peanuts? It seems a very Shultzian moment, and this a very fine thing, a very fine thing.

      Translation with commentary: <br/> 
 <em><br/>
In a whirl of instant messes and broad bans on the interweb, one man has the patience, one man has the self-control and the stringy old mind to continue to pomade. (This helps him in odder areas of life as well.  The traits and the pomades too, I guess.)<br/>
</em> <br/> 
Here Glad takes on the most troubling issue of the day: abusive trolls who create new accounts from which to post their dreck (perpetrators of "instant messes") and the lengths to which the Assetbar community must go to counteract them ("broad bans," a reference to the shadowy administrators' JIA plan). <br/> 
 <br/> 
While his contemporaries wear each other down with endless debate, Glad keeps his "stringy old mind" focused.  By applying pomade to his shaved head, he transforms himself into a shining beacon of clarity in a world of chaos. <br/> 
 <em><br/>
Part of the problem to me seems to be,<br/>
at least for me as far as I can see,<br/>
that we cannot see enough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109185644/https://www.amazon.com/tag/dep%20hair%20gel">DEP</a> beneath DC.<br/>
For me, an obvious fix is to decree<br/>
that we set our indoctrination free.<br/>
That way we may finally cede<br/>
what it truly means to be.<br/>
</em> <br/> 
Here the artist turns his attention to American politics, noting how few of the power brokers beneath the Capitol dome have followed his lead in using hair products to illuminate their paths.  With even the government corrupted, the artist's mood turns bleak in the final couplet of the poem, as he concludes that one must abandon "what it truly means to be" because the trolls have won.  He contemplates joining the refugees who have abandoned the forum, sacrificing their carefully honed avicon identities to escape the trolls. <br/> 
 <em><br/>
Dirty wars and the poems of border conscripts damn us all, thanks to you.<br/>
</em> <br/> 
Finally, Glad's despair turns to anger, and he aims his anger directly a the reader.  He places the blame for the troll wars, and the sad fate of all the innocent civilians pulled from the periphery into the heart of the conflict, squarely upon the shoulders of the forum community. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Gladiator-dude has got no mercy.

      the straight translation-- <br/> <br/> <br/> in a world of instant messaging and broadband internet one man has the patience, one man has the self control and the strength of mind to continue to poem. (this helps him in other areas of his life as well. the traits and the poems too i guess.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>part of the problem to me seems to be<br/>
at least for me as far as i can see<br/>
that we cannot see deep enough beneath the sea<br/>
for me the obvious fix is to decree<br/>
that we set our imaginations free<br/>
that way we may finally see<br/>
what it truly means to be.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
that was a poem of broader concept than usual. thanks to you. <br/> <br/> <br/> it's true, y'know.

      Thank you for that translation! I'd gotten parts of it (enough to know that first translation was superfluous), but read in it's full glory...Wow! <br/> 
 <br/> 
A chubby for you both. Try on that most of humanity is chasing its collective tail trying to get someplace it already is, and always wondering what it all means without simply enjoying the experience of being. Being alive. Being human. Being human being. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have a rendezvous with Life <br/> 
In days I hope will come <br/> 
Ere youth has sped and strength of mind, <br/> 
Ere voices sweet grow dumb; <br/> 
I have a rendezvous with Life <br/> 
When Spring's first heralds hum. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It may be I shall greet her soon, <br/> 
Shall riot at her behest, <br/> 
It may be I shall seek in vain <br/> 
The peace of her downy breast. <br/> 
Yet I would keep this rendezvous, <br/> 
And deem all hardships sweet, <br/> 
If at the end of the long white road <br/> 
There Life and I shall meet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sure, some will cry it better far <br/> 
To crown their days in sleep, <br/> 
Than face the wind, the road, and rain, <br/> 
To heed the calling deep. <br/> 
Though wet, nor blow, nor space I fear, <br/> 
Yet fear I deeply, too, <br/> 
Lest Death shall greet and claim me ere <br/> 
I keep Life's rendezvous. <br/>

      "In regards to safer sex practices, dental dams are most commonly recognized for their use during cunnilingus and analingus, to protect against the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. An unpunctured dental dam may be held over the vulva or anus, allowing oral stimulation of these areas without transmission of bodily fluids." <br/>

Let Trouble Makers trouble make, <br/> 
And fill the land with qualm and quake, <br/>

A garden-spot of glorious worth, <br/> 
Committed to our care that we <br/> 
May make it yield more fruitfully, <br/> 
I'll turn my back on raucous stir <br/>

You mean when you read a really good book, and you want to write a book just like it? <br/> 
Like, do you have to see a naked guy who is really good at pointing naked in order to be inspired to point naked?  Well I guess if I were naked I wouldn't be pointing, 'cause I'd be covering myself up.  You'd have to be a sinner to point naked.

      You can't borrow me, but you can borrow lil (not very little) me.  It's detachable (cue the music). <br/>

Also you can borrow, (who haven't I picked on much) um, Catgrl.  She's mighty swarthy.  Like a damn she-chewbacca.  Gets me pointing in all sorts of north.

      Dude. This is the Internet. I'm sure what you said makes you feel very nice and noble and all, but please, take the lofty sermons elsewhere. It is not incumbent on anyone to sift through the piles of bullshit and hostility that a troll DELIBERATELY presents in order to see his beautiful inner humanity or whatever. If you have the time and patience to do that, that's your problem. Somehow the other 99% of us are capable of communicating without such great effort. Also, you're fairly new here and haven't seen nearly the full extent of his assholishness. So trust the wisdom of the community when we say HE'S A DOUCHE. And please drop the high-school guidance counselor/inspirational speaker tone, it's extremely grating.

      1. I wished I'd caught that as a jab instead of a rankle - I really didn't have time or much inclination to write all of that last night. Oh well. . .      : ) <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. Never said anything remotely like "the troll is cool." You added that. I said the troll is human, and has all the same basic sets of motivations as all humanity. No one works as hard at it as this without it serving some stand or another that they have taken.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Do I think the miscreation that I've seen spewed forth in this space in the time I've been here is "cool"? Hell no! And I've said it to his face. But, in the momments when he forgets he's "suppose" to be vile, he does add useful, thoughtful, and thought-provoking content that I appreciate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For you, the signal to noise ratio isn't what you need it to be to stay tuned to that channel. I get that, and I'm not asking you to tune in. I'm only asking the space to be able to choose to. Writing off any of you is tatamount to writing off a part of me, or all of you, and I won't do it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. You haven't done anything to earn my esteem and respect. It's who you've been and are. But don't worry if you can't see it. Most people can't when they are the topic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm going to respond to achilleselbow here as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dude, this is  <em>totally</em>  the Internet. No intent for "lofty sermons", believe it. If I had read Loneal's jab correctly, I'd have laughed insted, and enjoyed that more. I get ya'! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Same thing I said above about signal-to-noise. If you seek his humanity  <em>through</em>  his posts, forget about it! They are generally less authentic then he is about himself to himself. Most humans lead an essentially inauthentic life. I know I sure as hell do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, if you "get" his humanity before you even read his posts, then you get where he's being authentic and real. T'ain't no thing if you don't want to or don't know how - a few years back, I'd have been incapable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not a guidance counselor, and no high school would hire me, but I wouldn't mind being inspirational. Obviously, this didn't do it for you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Myself, I rank the above as only slightly less annoying then a root canal, and would not have gone there if I didn't think I needed to clear things up with loneal. Turns out I didn't need to. My bad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I'll retract. If any of it works for you, feel free to make it your own. <br/> <br/> <br/> Now can we get off this shit, and get back to the fun?

      To say that he's human is a triviality, like saying that we're all carbon-based lifeforms. Obviously for me to make an ethical judgment about anyone already implies that I've assumed them to be human. The point is that some people choose to use this humanity in objectionable ways. Being human in itself is not some praiseworthy accomplishment. Nor is occasionally saying something bordering on sense a laudable feat - being that pure evil doesn't exist in some metaphysical sense, it must take great effort to consistently go against natural human impulses and the implicit rules of communication to spew hateful nonsense even 90% of the time. I'd wager his lucid moments are more of an oversight than anything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Despite being ensconced in postmodern theory, I find the constant excuses of "art" and "exploring the medium" trite, and based on a lack of understanding that the Internet is not some artificial construct, but just as primary a medium of communication as speech. Consider if a room full of people were having a conversation and enjoying themselves and someone burst in and started getting in people's faces and screaming nonsensical invective at the top of his lungs. Sure, he might defend it as performance art and "exploring the medium of language and human interaction", and the more philosophically-minded members of the group might theoretically agree, but it doesn't mean that everyone in the room wouldn't think he's an asshole and probably beat the shit out of him or at least call the cops. Would you in this case jump up and assert that the intruder is human and that we should let him stick around in case he manages to say something useful in the midst of his rants? Now, I ask you, given the amount of time that one spends there, why should the Internet be any different?

      Man, do we gotta keep talkin' 'bout this? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ya' read me, ya' didn't hear me. That's fine. Part of what it is to be human: we don't listen. (I know I sure as hell don't!) <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. De-humanize  <em>any</em>  human being, such as calling them "troll" or "abomination", disconnect from what it is to be human ourselves. I'm not talkin' from a context of morality, or "right" vs. "wrong". Just natural laws of the universe - workability. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It just don't work to treat any human being's humanity as trivial. That  <em>is</em>  the point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
None of us are a fixed point on a grid, unmoving, unchanging. We are a sine wave, constantly moving in time and space. Yet we treat other humans around us like objects. We allow ourselves to be in different spaces, but create others has being seperated from us, and fixed. They are EXACTLY the way they have always been, and will always be for us. We are unwilling to enter each renewed interaction with the simple question: "Who are you today, and what are the commitments that drive your actions today?" No! we won't do that! Instead, we already know exactly what they're going to say, and we don't listen. Re-read my previous posts, not listening for "he's defending the troll" but listening for "he's standing for all of us, which includes the troll". If we don't all win, I haven't won. If any one of us is incomplete in communication, then I am incomplete. If any one of us is uncomfortable being here, then I am uncomfortable as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. I have not made you wrong for feeling or being the way you are towards/about AIU. I have encouraged you to do whatever works for you. I am a pull for you really enjoying your time here. Period. 'Nuf said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. Please don't make me wrong for feeling or being the way I am about it. You don't have to get it for it to be perfect the way it is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
4. So, let's say the performance artist crashes the dinner party? My wife would be freaked! (Likely.) The cops would be called. (Not by me.) I would offer him a drink and a plate. If his behavior was outrageous, I would try to get into his space and world to get what that was about. I can express not being willing to put up with something clearly without making the other person wrong or inhuman. It is strictly a question of what works and doesn't work. If any of my guests had a violent reaction toward him (possible, but not likely), I would stand between them, and take the beating for him. My dinner party, my responsiblity for everything that enters the space. Period. Would I die for him? Let's hope it doesn't come to that, but yes, I would. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In Junior High, we find different levels of maturity (both physical and mental). I recall one of my friends (he could be a real asshole) calling out a kid who was literally twice his size, maybe more. This kid was normally pretty mellow, despite being the power behind our football team, but got ticked off enough to descend upon my friend, fists clenched. I stood between them, looked all the way up into his redwood face and told him he'd have to go through me first. Inside, I knew I was dead. I was so calling myself a fool and an idiot. He looked down for a minute, clenched, and then relaxed and said it was no thing. His beef wasn't with me, and he was in awe of the loyalty. (I gained a new friend, and my asshole friend spent the next week in orbit around me - so annoying!) If I could be that thirteen year old, being not much different on the whole immature and unsure scale than any other kid, I'd like to think I could be that man today. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But please get that it wouldn't be "in case he manages to say something useful". It would be because HE IS HUMAN, TOO. The day I turn my back on any of you is the day I cease to be aware of who we all are collectively. That's the day that I am no longer a stand against holocaust and genocide, racism and bigotry. That doesn't mean ya' gotta join me there. It also doesn't mean I gotta "put up with" anything. I am all about LIVING this life I got, not just SURVIVING it! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Look, I really get that you've got history here. I get that part of who you are about it is that you failed, and you cover that by saying "he's not worth it!" Dude, it's cool. You didn't fail. You did what you did, and didn't do what you didn't do. That's all. And it was perfect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, it ain't saying  <em>anything</em>  about you if I do something different. That's all. Let it be! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now can we get on to other topics?

      Wow. I said X, you heard X Y. Now get what I said is said from a space where I am. I don't expect anyone else on earth to see it the way I do.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
You ignore a "troll", then you have ignored a "troll". It didn't mean anything more or less. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I ignore a fellow human being, or mistreat them in anyway (coming from a belief that to ignore is one of the worst ways to mistreat), regardless of how well they are behaving, I have started down that path which leads to hate, genocide, disconection, war, all kinds of beautiful human things. Being aware of this, I choose not to ignore anyone. It's all in how it's created. Most people don't create it the way I do. I get that, and I'm down with it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But what if everyone did? Then there wouldn't be any "trolls" in the first place! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ignoring trolls = Ignoring trolls <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the context of who I am at the level of world, Ignoring a fellow human = gateway to genocide et al. <br/> 
 <br/>

      Believe me, Achilleselbow, if the popular psychology of the world was anything like what I've given you, the world around you would look much different then it does now. A different that common humans would choose unfaillingly if it were only available. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not touchy-feely. I am clear that AIU has reeked destruction and terror, and harmed those who have reached out. I am also clear that I am basically an asshole who doesn't give a crap about anyone. That's who I am left to my own devices. Just an ordinary, self-serving bloke. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I also get who I am at the level of group, community and world. This has caused me to take stands on things. Within the context of these stands, and with the awareness of what an asshole and jerk I really am, I have the ability to choose to behave other than that. This is anything but touchy-feely. Sometimes it outright insane! But it is a very fulfilling way to be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I sense that dismissing this as "touchy-feely", "everyone-is-perfect-just-the-way-they-are" and "pop psychology" is just a way of not having to really get what it is. Which in and of itself is fine. But what I got is that you don't want to give up being "right" about AIU, not because you might not be, but because doing so  <em>means</em>  something about you as a human being. That's why I invite you to try on that it says absolutely  <em>nothing</em>  about you that you gave up on him. I'm certain he pushed to see how far he could go before you would, and he is damned good at it. He got there. So, you did what you did, didn't do what you didn't do, AND it was perfect. Being who you are, you couldn't have done otherwise. Now allow yourself to be perfectly human, even if that means that you are so imperfect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am always pulling for humans to be more than just-the-way-they-are. And always accept them just that way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is easy to die for something, but try living for it. Now there's a challenge!

 <br/> 
And just to be perfectly clear, I am not i_love_kate's Kate.

 <br/> 
First, This isn't work, so all bets are off, young lady. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Second, there are things that sex breeds far more routinely then lawsuits (as I'm sure you know.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Third, here I . . . no, wait . . . OK, just kidding. Put down the pepper spray!! Really. Joke. IT'S JUST A JOKE! I <Pssssssssssssssssss> ARGH!! <br/>

      Kamet's pepper spray is rough to start, but finishes with a fresh lemon aftertaste.  I think I have a little on one of my tender areas if someone wants to lick it off.

      The new system, whereby people who are ignored by many others get automatically added to my ignore list, is brilliant.  No longer do I have to painstakingly search through every new strips posts to find all of aiu's new troll accounts, I just log on a few hours after the strip is up, and they are already preignored on my behalf.  Thank you, assetbar, and may you always take off every zig, for great justice.

      This is probably the finest Achewood I've ever read. Referencing interstitial fluid and the rectus sheath, both of which terms I needed to consult Wikipedia to imbibe. Then, Charles Bronson adorning a box of tampons and some of the snappiest dialogue I've seen leading up to the conniption-indusingly hilarious "Vagina Products MacGyver" line. I mean, goddamn son.
