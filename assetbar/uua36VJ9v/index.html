      Yeah, that bowl can be quite a good amplifier.  Pissing against the side and not directly into the pool is also much quieter, and minimizes the dried pee splash that decorates most men's bathrooms.

      I spent two weeks trying to edit a reference to Achewood into the Catullus article. Just a "Catullus was mentioned in the webcomic Achewood" with a link to the Catullus strip. I even had it entered in the "Catullus in Popular Culture" section of the article. Those uptight Wiki-dorks deleted it every time.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the discussion area, they told me to look at the other popular culture entries to see what was "appropriate".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well fuck you, Wikipedia, for only thinking Operas and the like are appropriate pop culture.

      Urine drying on the flat surface of a toilet rim is no one's defintion of clean. While the urine hitting the side walls of the toilet does have a minor cleaning effect, the risk of pissing on the rim and floor are greater than if you pissed directly into the water. Given the fact that urine does not always exit the male urethra in an orderly and straightforward fashion this further contributes to a dirty toilet rim. And yes, I am an idiot.

That still doesn't explain those people I've come across in public bathrooms: they start flushing the urinals as soon as they start peeing, and continue to do so until done, maybe 3 or 4 times.  It bothers me to no fucking end.

      Man, what the fuck? Personally, I try and remember to not audiocast, but I then forget, start peeing, feel terrible for the amount of noise I'm making, reach over and try and turn on a faucet, re-direct my stream of pee and end up peeing in the bath tub, freak out because I really wanted to have sex with the person in the other room and there is no way they are going to bone me if they hear how loud I pee and I peed on all their things, accidentally urinate on myself, and start singing the first verse of James Brown's "The Big Payback" acapello while flushing repeatedly to cover up the noise of my continued peeing and also while wiping up the pee. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, really, that only happened once. But it stuck in the mind, and to this day I'm really neurotic about peeing.

      Occasionally when I worked at Broadwing I'd have a reverie in the toilet stall, you know: #2 - when a mystery person would enter the bathroom and make the terrifying noise of a mop bucket being dumped into the urinal. I could never conclude my business rapidly enough to assess the person responsible, or whether an actual bucket was involved. Finally a few months into this mystery, fortune smiled as I was washing my hands. Douchey McDouchekins (a high-level back stabbing douche hated by everyone including his friends) came in and made that terrifying sound, WITH HIS PENIS. To this day I still shudder ...

      This strip changed my urinating habits for the better.  Dudes, just because we  <em>can</em>  pee standing up does not mean we  <em>should,</em>  especially when your aim is hell of terrible.

      To do anything other than pee standing up is to deny reality and attempt to censor life.  I'm not going to sit here like a Puritan from the xteenth century and pretend that these Unclean acts aren't happening; noises from peeing are as real as the thousands of children living in Africa today who'll be dead tomorrow, the tortured prisoners in jails across the planet, and the spoiled rotten celebrities who contribute nothing and live in sloth. <br/>
