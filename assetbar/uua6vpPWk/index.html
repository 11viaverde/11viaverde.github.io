      This is over a year old but I just have to comment that if not for many of you on Assetbar, I would miss all these little details because I fly through most webcomics (that might have something to do with reading Dinosaur Comics before anything).  I have to get the books so I can let my eye rest on each panel for more than 2 seconds after reading the text.  Computers are hard on meine Augen.

      Ray's logic: <br/>

      I love Onstad & Achewood's relationship to Britain (I am english) - he is obviously an anglophile, loves the UK & lots of aspects of its culture, and thus - in Onstad fashion - makes fun of it all the time. His accents are often pretty good, I think.

      Believe it or not, even here in Texas, there are people who are not mindless jingoists.  I think the issue isn't that there are more rabid nationalists in America, but rather that they're much more vocal than anywhere else.   <br/>

Granted, it's public acceptance of meaningless symbolism that enables it to continue.  (Big Fat) Rush and Nancy Grace still have audiences, no matter how much I wish they'd both go away.

      I like the idea that people imagine themselves born outside of a pre-assigned group (intelligent people, for instance) and then have to spend most of their time trying to escape to the promised land. It's the fear of absorbing the features of a stereotype and mostly it's a fear that perpetuates the concentration of a particular stereotype in a particular area. <br/>

I do the same by remaining in the city after being born "in the west". Crazy.
