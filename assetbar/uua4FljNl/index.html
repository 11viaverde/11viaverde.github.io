I had not seen this strip at the time but I recall being aware that I kept saying 'He was STEALING a BIKE' in a horrified tone - like 'yeah he was, you know, normal height, and he had glasses, but, but he was STEALING a BIKE!

      I love how into the second to last panel he's peering out of his window all careful. Almost as if he fears that there will be empty-pissing-in dirtbags doing sinister things on his property when he looks out.

      I like that Ray is using demographic profiling in defense of his complaint. <br/>

      I guess it is because the dude's haircut was so messy and basically bad that Ray wasn't sure if it was that way on purpose or if the guy just never took care of his har.
