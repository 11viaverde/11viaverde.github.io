      It WAS a cock to a stranger move to lame the guy three times, but I follow your reasoning.  I don't really think it is image-crafting or anything as negative as that, but you don't really need to correct a minor infraction such as a misspelling.  You shouldn't have to fear lames for correcting yourself, or for making a little error.  It's the Year of True Magic, can't we all just lol?

      Actually, I've noticed a pretty strange phenomenon. In a surprising number of cases, these correction/clarification comments have received more chubbies than the original comments. <br/>

 <em>Those</em>  are the sorts of people who run  <em>this</em>  joint.  <br/>

Though presently cocksure, Wargasmic will assimilate or fade away, in time. Either that, or he will hate this place and keep coming back anyway. There's a pretty solid tradition of that sort of behavior, as well.

      Depends.  In TN and surrounding, people just say "y'all."  In the ATL and urban deep such as New Orleans it goes to "all y'all" and that can stretch as far as Houston.  But usually by Dallas on all the way to CA it's back to "y'all."  But then it becomes a mixed bag completely.

      But it would turn out to be Ray's great great great uncle Hubert Smuckles, who perished when the mine was flooded in 1863. And Ray would buy that mine because that is what his g.g.g uncle would have wanted. Diamonds are discovered in the mine in the following strip and Ray uses them to gravel his driveway. Pat makes a rare re-appearance to comment that this is perhaps a little bit extravagant and offensive. But, while everyone mostly agrees with his viewpoint, the manner in which he expressed it causes everyone to consider him a dick. Philippe never goes to Disneyland.

      When I last went to Disneyland (well, Disneyworld) I was 6 years old -- and absolutely terrified of clowns and puppets.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
This did not bode well for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Everywhere I went, men in suits,  <em>human puppets</em> . I cried, I screamed, I ran from my parents and I hid behind a trashcan in SpaceLand...while my parents searched for me in WonderLand. I kept hiding and crying, until Goofy stumbled towards me, leaving me no choice but to flee once more. I saw Minnie and Pluto, and hid beneath a bench.  <em>Everywhere, puppets. Puppets, everywhere.</em>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then, I listened to the loud voice coming over the park and heard the teenage girl blandly describing a child with my exact characteristics -- they were hunting me! I crawled further towards the back of the bench and sobbed and sobbed. <br/> <br/> <br/> Twenty minutes later a very fat, very curly-haired woman spotted me and took me back to my terrified and worried parents.

      That's pretty much my stepson's response when he was 5. Every character but Snow White scared him. When we went back last year (he was 11), he still avoided Goofy and sought out the Princesses. I believe that is a Sign.

Boy seeks Cinderella. <br/>

equals <br/> 
 <br/> 
Boy seeks to make Barbie look fierce for her upcoming runway show. <br/>

I know everyone's different, but when I was subjected to Disneyland as a boy, Cinderella was not only boring, but unconditionally gross. I pretty diligently sought out Pluto, and I'm as straight as the day is long.

      I worked a summer job in Disneyland as a very young man. Bad pay, lots of girls to look at, and some funny stories. Like the guy who smuggled hot stereo equipment to sell to people in the park. Then there was time that there were too many Goofy's in the same part of Tomorrow Land at once, and several of them had to bust ass out of there at top speed -  <em>top</em>  speed- lest they confuse and/or frighten the small children.

      When you've got an equation where  <em>x</em>  is squared, <br/> 
And you need to find the answer, need to be prepared, <br/> 
I can show you a way that's automatic. <br/> 
You just use the formula that's called the Quadratic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now the first thing you do, you wanna be a solvin' hero, <br/> 
Is you take the whole equation, set it equal to zero. <br/> 
Then you take the terms, get 'em set up tight, <br/> 
With  <em>x</em> -squared on the left, and the constant on the right. <br/> 
Then you take your numbers (there's gonna be three), <br/> 
And you call 'em the  <strong>a</strong> , the  <strong>b</strong>  and the  <strong>c</strong> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
And it's minus  <strong>b</strong> , plus or minus the, <br/> 
Square root of  <strong>b</strong> -squared minus  <strong>4ac</strong> . <br/> 
Then you take the fraction bar, you take it all the way, <br/> 
And underneath, you put  <strong>2a</strong> . <br/>

      This is exactly what I meant up there in my original post, spelling your daughter's name "Styphany" and pronouncing it "Stephanie" is so irresponsible, it does NOT make them seem more "Yünike". <br/> 
Related story: <br/> 
Last month I had to do a job wherein a girl's name was to be printed on a plaque, so when I got the handwritten copy and saw her name spelled as "Dominque", I assumed that the customer made a spelling error.  I changed it to "Dominique", and when I handed over the plaque, the lady had a shitfit because I added the "i" where it should have logically been.  Her explanation was that it was pronounced like "Dominique", but that they just chose to spell it that way.  I'm convinced that her parent's made a mistake filling out the birth certificate and just said "fuck it."  Poor kid.

      I resent all of you who have the luxury of complaining about theme parks. The closest I ever got to DisneyLand was a place called Upper Clements' Park which was HISTORICALLY THEMED. All I know is this: I have never had the pure wild joy of screaming whilst upside down traveling 200 km/hr NOR have I experienced anything even relatively close to what Mariah Carey's Fantasy video promises me (except for certain sections of the ODB rap). Incidentally, the reason my family did not take us to DisneyLand (according to my  2 older brothers) was because all the package were for 4 person families.  <br/>

      Mariah Carey's "Fantasy" video was filmed at Rye Playland in Rye, NY. If you ever find yourself in the northern environs of New York City, admission is free. You have to pay to ride the rides. Have a good time. Might I recommend the Dragon Coaster? <br/>

      I really wish people wouldn't equate a 4 with 'terrible'. If you look at all the strips, the real rating scale is something like 4.3 to 4.8. If you gave this a 5, do you really think it's as funny as Roast Beef Bangs a Website or Roast Beef and Molly Talk Like Dogs? For me a 5 is strips like that, which made me laugh out loud twice or more. 4 is if it made me laugh once, 3 for nothing more than a chuckle or finding something rather clever, and two if it was just nothing (which is rare). <br/> 
 <br/> 
To sum up, you guys shouldn't rate strips the way a professor of an intro film class at a shitty liberal arts school grades 3-page papers.

      I guess another criteria I use for a 5 is whether I can show the strip to almost anyone I know (within a reasonable margin) and get an awesome response. A lot of the strips are only funny in the context of having read through the entire archive, but the real classics are the ones that can stand on their own.

      Avon ladies are people who set up impeccably decorated offices in crumbling storefronts and tell you within five minutes of meeting you that they are barren, which presumably is meant to foster an artificial sense of sympathetic sisterhood that will convince you to buy terrible makeup in a hateful mockery of entrepreneurship and feminist zeal.  I don't know what being one of those is like, but that afternoon left me depressed for like a week.

      I have been to Disneyland at least twice (maybe thrice, I can't recall). But the one thing I remember in particular was when we went to the Hall of Presidents. My parents, my little brother, and my older half-sister were there with me; at the time my half-sister was probably in her early- to mid-teens; I was probably close to ten. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway. They don't allow flash photography in the Hall of Presidents. My sister asked my dad why that was, and he told her that it was because the heat from the flashes could eventually melt the Presidential wax figures. I guess he must have kept a pretty straight face, because my sister pretty much believed it until she asked my mom about it later. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is what I remember about Disneyland.

      Boring! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I went to Disneyland a couple years ago...  it was fun seeing all the old animatronic stuff like the old Sleeping Beauty ride and the Tiki Room.  It's good times.  Apart from the flagrant and unchecked line-jumping and the fact that all the cool old stuff is getting phased out in favor of new crap (for instance, the Hall of Progress getting dumped) it was fun. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What kind of surprised me though was when I went to Main Street USA (way cheesier than I remember it being) and saw the old Mickey Mouse cartoons, like "Steamboat Willie"...  It turns out Mickey Mouse is a real  <em>prick</em> !  Consider: <br/> 
 <br/> 
- He hoisted his girlfriend up onto a boat by  <em>snagging her underwear with a cargo crane</em> <br/> 
- He hit a cow's teeth with a couple of hammers <br/> 
- He grabbed a cat by the neck in one hand, the tail in the other, and  <em>pulled</em> .  Repeatedly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's kind of shocking, when you're part of a culture that generally holds Mickey Mouse in high regard, to find that he's really an asshole.

      I  <em>see.</em>  Perhaps one could make a similar statement about Horace Horsecollar. <br/>

I mean, not only was he a black horse, he wore a horsecollar (which could be a symbol of slavery), but "horsecollar" was his  <em>name.</em>

      Why assume I've been higher edu-macated? I could just be one of those crazy homeless people who rants at you from the corner about aliens and government conspiracies. Then I go to the library and use the public computer to read Achewood and leave incendiary comments on the message board. Also I have a huge dong. <br/>

I'm just saying it's entirely plausible. <br/>

As far as the quotes - two things: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. I love the quote feature. I use it for that reason. <br/>

2. What if twenty people reply to Tekende? In that case, that quote would save my message from looking like nonsense. This has happened to me and I like to guard against it. <br/>

      Quick general question, nowhere is to put it:  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I set my lame limit to 100 because I want to be able to see every comment and decide for myself if the comment is lame. I get the feeling a lot of others, if not the majority, have done the same. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What about the chubby to highlite ratio? I set mine at 20. 20 assures me that it's essentially a must read. What about you guys?

      'nowhere to put it'... <br/> 
 <br/> 
...That's what SHE said! <br/> 
 <br/> 
But seriously folks, I set mine to 3, because really I have nothing better to do and I end up reading pretty much all of them anyway. But also, people are often too profligate with their chubbies and run out within a couple of hours, so someone may post a genius comment later on in the day and only get 5 chubbies or so. I keep mine at 3, but for you busy folks on the go 5 seems about right. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, just a heads up - there is actually at least one comment that went over 100 lames. It was somewhere during the baseball arc where someone dared to say they didn't like the Great Outdoor Fight. After that I tend to set mine at something ridiculously high so I never accidentally miss a similar debacle in the future.

      Saying that you don't like the GOF on assetbar is tantamount to standing up during a Catholic mass to announce that you don't much care for the Virgin Mary.  You can criticize some of the congregation's other beliefs and values, but the line has to be drawn somewhere.

      Honestly, I really don't get it. It was such a non-representative story arc compared to the rest of Achewood, and there are just so many other funnier strips. There were some funny parts like the guy whose wife had a credit card problem, but overall the humor seemed more South Park than Achewood (long homage/parody of action movie cliches, etc.) Not to mention I think Ray gets way too much attention as it is compared to, say, Lyle. Maybe I'm missing something, but it just seems overhyped to me.

And just like a mailman, he  <em>always delivers</em> . <br/> <br/> <br/> ....not true, he really sucks quite a bit.  But less than the others, for sure.  Still has nothing on even the worst characters WB has made, I'll grant you.
