      Personally I want to be fired via slingshot at a target on the ocean. It will be presented such that if I hit the target I will get into heaven but if I miss I will not, but the target will be very large so as to not make it a downer for everyone.

My comment was not disparaging to you, no. Another symptom of depression is not feeling fear in a life-threatening situation. Hugh Laurie figured out he had problems when he was in a rally car race and it provoked no emotional response from him at all.

      Here I think you%u2019re blurring the lines between being depressed and being suicidal. Being suicidal is to have no fear of being mauled to death in a rally car race. The primary objective is the absence of pain, the relinquishing of responsibility, etc. Depression is to imagine scenarios in which your lover or spouse is present at said car race, is getting it on on the hood of a rally car with a girl much more intelligent and physically attractive than yourself. From afar they point at you, gesture about your unbecoming hairstyle, and laugh uproariously. Then they get into the rally car and maul to you death, and your mangled body is shown on the telecaster, and the audience cheers.

      Hm, I'm not so sure. Wouldn't suicidal thoughts and tendencies be a definite symptom of clinical depression? It sound like you're describing massive insecurities and avoidant tendencies, which can contribute to depression.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, Hugh Laurie's reaction doesn't count as suicide, I think. He just felt completely bored to be there. He felt no threat or exhilaration at all, which is not a healthy thing to think.

      I don't think so. Depression manifests itself in many forms. One of those is anxiety, which is the getting it on part of the above. Another is just a psychic numbing effect, where emotional affection becomes muted - simply put, the depressed person doesn't just not give a shit, they can't, really. It's a really awful position to be in, because most of the reasons commonly given for living all hinge on being able to emotionally respond to them. It's like being the Bubble Boy, only without becoming famous for your suffering.

      I imagine myself being clawed to death by an irate giant anteater or similarly large fossorial mammal after prodding it into a rage with a spoon. Then the remains of my corpse would found a fortnight or so later, and following the autopsy, would have to be preserved for the duration of legal proceedings while PETA or such a company found themselves in a legal battle over the fate of said burrower and the stress I apparently caused it versus the danger it could apparently cause.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Somewhere in the midst of all this, someone would lose the body and nobody would notice for a while. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hopefully the anteater could go home afterwards though.

      Well, let's see... a bowling alley is where lower-middle class white people go to get drunk and make no contribution to society (trust me, I'm on two leagues); so the exact opposite of that would be a place where sober, upper-class black people go to attempt to change the world. <br/>

The opposite of a bowling alley is, evidently, the Democratic National Convention.

      God said "Watch out!"? Seems fairly informal. Surely he should have said, "Verily, keep watch", or something slightly more Biblical. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I actually have no idea if that's supposed to be God speaking, seeing as how I never got much further in a Bible than reading Genesis and finding it really funny. Not because I think Creationism is crazy jibberish or anything (that's a whole other issue), just because of how it's written. Does that mean I'm going to hell? No, because it doesn't exist.

      Let's not beat around the bush here. Roast beef is a strange and dismal guy, for the most part. I almost wish this strip went on for another three panels so Beefo could keep coming up with veaguly depressing and disconcerting things to associate with his passing. Maybe play "Yesterday" at 78 RPM and have the wake at an old roller-disco place.

      Are you ready for my big-ass post about this comic? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roast Beef's first name is Cassandra. Cassandra was an oracle who was cursed to never be believed when she predicted the future. Roast Beef is telling Ray right now about his actual funeral. What he does not understand from this telling, however, is that the service will be done reverently, painstakingly, the sassy black woman speaking with nothing but love for the cat, the thirteen ugly children his own progeny.

      I couldn't stand a normal funeral, because those get hell of boring hell of quick. No one wants to sit around with family members and listen to a dude pretend to know about you. <br/> 
I'm aiming to have one room playing all the movies I love at once on TVs lining the walls, and in the other room, a dance party featuring all the songs I hate the most. My casket will be wheeled back and forth between the two by whomever wishes to do so. It will be painted in the manner of a rocking ship. Any remarks must be prepared and presented beforehand to the bouncer; guests may deliver them at any point via one of those dangling microphones that boxing people use. <br/>

      I'd like my body flensed of all of its flesh, my skeleton wired together in an animatronic fashion, and then to be left around town in an assortment of fashionable poses. People would be initially horrified, and then grow to love me. <br/>

      It will be an overcast day, presided over by a New Orleans style procession near the sea. There will be an open casket. I will take a cue from Ray (without the resurrection) and wear something memorably ostentatious. The finale shall be a motorized device, built into the coffin, capable of hurling my corpse tens of hundreds of yards out to sea--into the distance, my body's fate unknown.

      I like that idea.   My dad died some years back and we actually did have a New Orleans-style funeral for him, because my mom and dad lived in that city for a long time, and were both musicians, and so we got the whole second line going in the streets of Midwestern Grand Rapids, Michigan, importing the jazz musicians they knew from that time to come and do the honors.   That's the best way to go out.   But the extra pyrotechnics would make it an affair to remember, that's for sure.

      I have two possibilities for when I die. The first is to have mechanical joints and voice box installed, so that I can greet the mourners with a hearty handshake and movements resembling those of the Hall of Presidents at Disneyland. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The other option, worked out with a good friend and drinking buddy, is to have my body embalmed and sealed in a giant bottle of beer. I will be wearing a suit and eternally raising an Oktoberfest-style beer stein. Underneath this bottle will be a keg of Guinness, the tap of which will extend aboveground so that my friends and family can have a beer with me when they come to visit my grave. The keg will be replaceable; keys will be provided to my friends and family so that I don't have teenagers stealing my keg after death. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If this proves prohibitively expensive, I want to be buried without a coffin and have a funnel stuck through the ground in front of my grave down to my mouth, so that my friends can pour one out for their dead homie without wasting perfectly good beer.

      I would like to have invisible little wires attached to my body marionette style, and then as the funeral goes on its normaly, merry way, suddenly Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now" starts to play, my hand coming up to do a cheerful little hand wave-with-pointed-finger at the "dont, stop me nowwwww" part, and then a slow rise at the "Having a good time, having a good time" and then just all out dancing crazily as the song kicks off.

      My second-best idea for my funeral more or less takes the form of a roast, where everyone gets at least one last laugh out of having known me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My best idea is a thing of low mind that I could probably only pull off after engaging the services of a Nice Pete type.  Out of respect to the delicacies of all involved here, I do not mention it by name.
