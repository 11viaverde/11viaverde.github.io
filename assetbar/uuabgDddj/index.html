"Bacon is simple, like a man smoking a cigarette on a train platform in Budapest. He doesn't need you, and he doesn't care if anyone cares about you. He's perfect at what he does, which is make everything porous smell like him. If a wolf ate him, the wolf would be named after him. The wolf would stink forever, and no hunter would place much value on his pelt."

      Ahh, the lens flare is the perfect touch; it is  <em>exactly</em>  the kind of effect that Ray would use were he to Photoshop.

      Terrifying, if this image ran on the front cover of any British tabloid (speech bubbles included) its effect on the British working class would probably actually be enough to destroy Cowell's career. Or, worse, make him more popular.

      Ray went about this in completely the wrong fashion.  Had he approached it differently, Simon might have done this shit for free.

      It's true. I think the poor testing of his DVD case idea knocked Ray of his game briefly and he rolled the dice on this pitch.
