Yes, I understand that the sexually-flagrant often have crabs. What I don't understand is why it's the book's representational picture, when it is a book about decorum. Crabs have little to do with decorum, regardless of location.

      I'm gonna come out and say this is the best fan-made strip of all time, and you should know I don't say such things lightly. Edwell's Gladi8orrex retrospective was a masterpiece, but this has the advantages of being self-contained rather than contextual to assetbar, and the structure is just perfect. Well done, sir, well done.

      Davey, the charm is integral to the instructions.  As it is integral to Onstad.  If you have not availed yourself of the Achewood Cookbook, you will be charmed, whether you like it or not. <br/>

      I'm going to attempt to collect these things now. I've got the things on this page, the Manflesh Criterion Library post sje linked to, and shmorky's flash animation. Some time in the (hopefully near) future I will go through edwell/hamscout/docrostov's comments and get pretty much all the images they ever posted. (I know echidnaboy posted that awesome, awesome thing above, but I don't seem to recall him doing much photoshop buggery otherwise.) Some time in the midst or after this, I will upload everything somewhere and  <em>have it be known</em> . Or I could give up partway through. We'll see. <br/>

If anyone's got suggestions (on who and what else to include, etc.), I'd like to hear them.

      Man why don't you come up with your  <em>own tattoos</em>  instead of trying to bite everybody else's style tryna be all hard did you ever think that maybe if you would just Do You then you could surpass the greats you worship so dicksuckily? You got to  <em>Be The Beast</em>  and your every move would be the new tradition, every phrase you speak could be surrounded by quotation marks and followed by a dash and your name and placed on the facebook profile of a drunken college jock with delusions of intellectualism So rise above and make your mark, take your time and lay your larks 'cause there is no room in this world for Beta males just shuffling through the day trying to take up as little space as possible.

      I think that it is cute that you've based a desire to go to a strip club with me on three things: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1.) I am a girl. <br/> 
2.) I live near you. <br/> 
3.) I like a comic that you like. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Though you could probably subtract any of these facts and the other two would still support said desire. <br/>

Or you just like strip clubs, but realize that you should not go alone. I think this is the safest bet.

MA does have full on nudity. I celebrated my 18th at Alex's in Stoughton. $10 cover, $15 for 2 cokes and $15 for the most beautiful girl I've ever seen to put (drag) her pierced lap on my face. I said "What time do you get off?" and she replied with "That depends how good you are, sugar." <br/>

      A certain friend of mine determines that a stripper is his soulmate every time we go to Tropical Lei.  It's disturbing - he chitchats with them for a few minutes and they tell him their "real name," they say.  I think that any good stripper has a fake real name for such occasions.  The last one was a latina girl who claimed to be an Ursula, but I think she was just messing with him.  I tipped her well for the effort in messing with him, after Ursula spent the better part of a half hour on my lap.

      Amusingly my standard fake name has been Cornelius since well before the beginning of Achewood. I think that everyone ought to have a standard alias. <br/>

Also fun is utilizing a series of relatively well-known aliases from film and literature. This, however, is a bit more of a personal shame in watching how poor the cultural knowledge of the average person is.

      Joachim Murat = Vain prissy man. I prefer Breaker Morant's last words before a firing squad "Shoot straight you bastards, don't make a mess of it", so much more better than "Not in the face, not in the face".

      Cornelius Mansfield. There is more truth in it than you will ever realize as well. I also give this almost exclusively as my name when at parties with drunk people who do not know me. I do not want to know them. If they ever meet me again and I, for some reason, find I do want to know them, they will merely think they were confused in their drunken haze and I will find it amusing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It also helps me understand how and when I met people that I run into whom I do not recognize (i.e. basically everyone).

      I have only ever been to one strip club in my 21 years...as kind of a dare while in Vegas. I will never go to another one. There was a four drink minimum and the place was as dark as the circles under the dancer's eyes. And I'm pretty sure a few of the girls were pre-ops. I went to the bathroom and one of the ladies said "How you doing, sugar?" and I was reminded of that one scene in Mrs. Doubtfire when Robin Williams is all dressed up like an old lady but he forgets and starts talking like a regular Joe. This was not the best of times.

      Scary.  Was this a way-off-the-Strip strip club?  Or perhaps catering to a  <em>special</em>  clientele.  My experience with Vegas strip clubs was that they could be cold and mercenary, or over-heated bacchanals, but usually glitzy with drop-dead gorgeous women, just because of the level of competition in Sin City. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I guess for every Bellagio, there's a Slots-A-Fun.

      Those artificial looking women one so often sees actually come off as far less attractive than the pre-ops to me. I will never understand what the apparent interest is there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think a point could be made for the type of society being defined, in a way, by it's strip clubs. San Francisco, for instance, has a notably worker-owned, unionized strip club catering to more of an alt. clientele.

      I'm not really into the tattoos or piercings as I tend to find both rather unseemly, but I find the women to be far more attractive. The artifical-looking women that make up much of porn and that are often presented as being "hot" do nothing for me. I find them viciously unattractive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I find women I see on the street generally much, much more attractive than, say, Pamela Anderson (disgusting), Angelina Jolie (visually offensive, her mouth disturbs me intensely), or Halle Berry (puke-o-tronic). <br/> 
 <br/> 
So it has nothing to do with interests, it's entirely an issue of aesthetics and a dislike for the portrayal of what is considered "attractive" that is prevalent in much of the mainstream. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I could, perhaps, extend this into a very interesting discussion of how the common claim that men's ideals of beauty are determined by the media is, in fact, false as I often dislike people presented within that mainstream concept, but someone would probably just come back and say that I'm consciously or unconsciously rebelling against that idea and claim it still has validity. They would be wrong. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In short, alt is for guys who think that Allyson Hannigan (or Jewel Staite or Felicia Day or maybe even women with nothing to do with Joss Whedon) is far more attractive than whatever fake-titted bimbo is in Playboy this month and who feel that she looked worse when heavily made-up into that idiom in that FHM (or whatever) shoot she did a while back.

      For me, I think it is a "chicken or the egg" sort of thing.  The reason those women are considered the most beautiful, are the same reasons you probably find girl-on-the-street beautiful, or Allyson Hannigan.  She's symmetrical, she appears fertile, and healthy enough to carry your offspring to term. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Playboy types look like cartoon versions of fertile women.  Heaving breasts, youthful facial features, nipped waists.  Probably the same aesthetics that factor into your physical attraction for any woman, except multiplied by twenty.  They're beautiful, but almost a parody of beauty. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Considering them viciously unattractive seems a bit much, though.  These women are, in so many ways, 'designed' for you to find attractive.  Good for you though, as a lady it is nice to know that men don't really buy into the 'perfect' gag always.

      Not even a parody. I find them unpleasant to look at. Full stop. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While I understand the viewpoint of there being a biological imperative in our views of what is attractive as someone who is also strongly, strongly opposed to children in any possible way (again, I find it unpleasant to look at babies... they are not cute, they are freaky, disgusting little fat things that I find frightening to look at) I certainly do not want a woman who appears at all fertile. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's also not just the physical features, but the overuse of makeup, the bleached hair, the unpleasantly large breasts (let's face it people, there is a range of what is desirable and fake breasts are never it) and a lot else about them is just... not good. They have an artificial sheen to them that makes them very unattractive with nothing even remotely beautiful about them. They certainly never look youthful. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the same time this appears to be a common issue. Hence the large segments of "amateur" and "teen" porn which tend to eschew these aesthetics. Likewise the rise of "alt" porn.

      Well, you are an outlier in that you don't think babies are cute.  There is no accounting for taste, I suppose, haha.  Amateur pornography doesn't eschew the basic tenants of pornography, and 'teen' based porn enforces them even more stringently.  Youthful, healthy women cavorting about sexually--whether they're wearing eyeshadow or not doesn't really factor in for a lot of men. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess there is something for everyone, and as with anything, there are some people who don't fit the terms.  I do believe, however, that most men (and women) look for a partner who is symmetrical, shows no signs of disease, is fertile, and youthful.  That doesn't leave a lot of room for amputee fetishists or those predominately attracted to the elderly, though.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only explanation I can figure is that we have a natural attraction system in place that prohibits our population from going out-of-control, by encouraging some to be attracted to those who are not capable of healthy breeding. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Obviously we've hit on an interest of mine, haha.

      None of this explains Japanese preferences. That is beyond science to explain. I should know, I am a scientist and I cannot explain much of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again Japan was a shy, isolated child that was seriously traumatized during it's teen years and subsequently exposed heavily to American culture at the time resulting in a bizarre adaptation. <br/>

None of this, however, explains  <em>The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife</em> . Clearly tentacle sex is a uniquely unexplainable interest.

      My old trivia team would occasionally when we got tired of our better names (Sunday!Sunday!Sunday!, Hot for Lincoln, The Axis of Awesome) try out other names. One that saw occasional use in this capacity was "Bukkake Explosion" (which wasn't anywhere as great as another team's "Anal Herscheisser") which was usually good for the occasional laugh by people familiar with it. The best part was one time when our turn came up and we were announced I heard some voices from the booth behind us muttering for a bit: first a girl's voice, then a guy's, and then "EWWW!!" or something similar. I then knew that I had made a difference.

      I just would like you to know that we support our position on the porn industry's pornography.  <em>We support it.</em>  Porn is not something that I engage in either. <br/>

The comment on Playboy bimbos looking decidedly like parody is so true. These are human beings that look so brittle and plastic, that you must assume that part of their plastic surgeries was to install a K/Y jelly machine hidden inside their ass injections that provides lubricant to their, well.....lets just not go even further than it already has gone.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That being said, any decent looking real life lady puts the porn industry women to shame given their aura of normalcy, non-desperation, and actual joy in physical acts.

      Ah, but what about Japanese porn? The women tend to look far more normal and realistic, but try finding a single video where they're allowed to express anything approaching joy. I swear even the ones that aren't specifically about rape might as well be about rape.

      No no, hentai is completely different from live-action Japanese porn. In hentai, the setup is usually that the girl is getting raped, but starts enjoying it in spite of herself, or she has some spell cast on her that makes her a nympho. But in real life, Japanese guys generally consider it a huge turnoff if a girl expresses anything resembling pleasure or excitement.

      Yeah. But at least it's not "I'm being forcibly probed by aliens and I do not like it, but I will submit" like a lot of male-female porn is. Lesbian scenes just tend to be sort of cold and lifeless. It also seems to account for a much, much smaller portion of the market. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The harem sub-genre of anime/hentai makes even less sense to me in the Japanese manner. A group of attractive ladies want to make the sexy (and cry while doing it) with a guy who is either completely oblivious or just actively disinterested in the whole concept. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Humiliation also seems to be pretty big in Japan. I mean, they have some negative attitudes towards women at a social level, but when it comes to porn it just becomes really awful in that respect. At the same time it seems, based on no hard evidence, that European porn tends to have more positive or dominant roles for women than in American porn. Fewer horny sluts more "women who want to explore their sexuality" which in a way that could be considered empowering if you really wanted to say that sort of thing. There certainly don't seem to be as many "young girls having sex for money" sleaze-fests either, but perhaps that depends. Eastern Europe certainly seems to enjoy trading in the whole naive and exploited concept more.

      Not especially. This is all just off the top of my head. Still, I think some interesting ideas can be derived from the treatment of women in pornography and the culture that created it. I'm sure there are a number of academic papers on this. I worry that there aren't any that are actually reasonable and not shrill and excessive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not hard to say "Dude, Japan, when almost all of your porn involves women being humiliated, abused, or just in general acting like it's a terrible ordeal then perhaps you have some problems with how you think of ladies." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or "Europe, you made a film where a classy-looking lady wearing what looks like expensive and tasteful lingerie decided that she wanted to try having different kinds of sex with a lots of different kinds of people. Everyone appeared to have a great time. Looks like you think it's cool that ladies can enjoy sex and still be classy even if they want to engage in gangbangs and all-girl orgies and such because maybe that's just something they'd like to do."

      Yea, it's interesting. The weird thing is that, from a cross-cultural comparison of pornography, you would think that relative to the US or Europe, Japan was a third-world country where all the women were basically slaves or something. And of course it does have a lot of problems with rape, prostitution, and income disparity, but for the most part, it seems to be on par with other first-world countries. How would you explain that?

      While on this subject I think it's relevant that Max Hardcore was sentenced to four years in prison due to "obscenity". This is crazy. Even if you do not like his films (and I do not want to watch them, no) it's quite crazy to put a man in prison for making movies with consenting peoples even if you find them abhorrent (I can see how some would feel that way, I frankly don't care what people want to do to get off as long as it's all consensual). I mean, that we even have laws against being obscene is the only thing I can find to be obscene.

      From what I've read, introducing sterile males into a population/sterilizing pre-existing males in a population works well to limit the population from growing, without destroying the species. <br/>

I believe they do it with deer, and definitely it is applied to insects.  Of course, that is different than some 'natural kick-in' that causes some to have abormal sexual desires that cannot result in fertility. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another thing that factors greatly into disproving what I said in my post, is the fact that we are quite clearly a very different animal than any other species.  After all, we HAVE sexual deviance, homosexuality, sex for pleasure's sake, and birth control.  All things that do not directly relate to the creation of a child.  <br/>

      The is the hypothesis that the famed '7 year itch' exists so that by the time offspring are either a) reasonably independent or b) dead, men start itching after novelty and thus stir the genetic soup.  We're born to be pigs, horndogs.  Deal with it.

      I disagree. Both "amateur" and "teen" porn tends to be based on both an artificial fantasy, but also an aesthetic choice which is made, among other reasons, to reinforce the chosen concept even though everyone involved knows that it is most definitely false. Both tend to go with more of a "girl-next-door" look in order to maintain this farce. "Teen" porn does, I'll admit, also tend to skew for a younger look, but it still maintains the same aesthetic concepts otherwise. Heavily made-up, fake breasts, and five-inch platform heels don't really factor into it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would contend that there is a significant portion of viewers interested in this for the aesthetic choices as much as the ones based on scenario. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, babies are disturbing parasites that grow inside of you while draining your nutrients. Obviously I'm a big fan of David Cronenberg.

      You are entirely correct. Baby animals are much, much cuter than human babies. Human babies look entirely like a glob of fat that cannot care for itself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is indeed adorable when a baby deer or elephant cannot stand up right away, but it can stand up and walk within like, a day or two, not years. This is a major point in favor of animals. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have discussed with my girlfriend whether it would be a good or bad thing to give birth to such as a puppy maybe. Like this was a thing that just happened to people sometimes if they wanted to perhaps. I believe that this has decreased my chances of ever having sex with any ladies at any point in the future forever now. I still think it's a valid question fraught with interesting ideas. I mean, if you'd really like to have a puppy, but not a baby it might be a good idea. Plus, I doubt your landlord could tell you that you can't have a puppy then. Not when you give birth to it. It might make the relationship with the puppy kinda weird though.

      I am generally averse to people significantly younger than me. As babies they're ugly and you can't communicate with them.

      No, baby animals are often fluffier. They are also often curious in a non-threatening way, but still smart enough not to put things in their mouths that don't belong there. The adult animals are usually also very cute. Their small size and playfulness makes them extra-adorable many times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In contrast human babies look nothing like an attractive, adorable adult should are amazingly dumb, and tend to cry a hell of a lot and look at you with their big, dumb, vacant eyes like an imbecile. It's like dealing with someone who is attempting to go through life fat, drunk, and stupid.

      No, I definitely identify as child-free. People who find babies adorable are sick deviants and want nothing to do with them. I am lucky that this is not a problem because, as I've stated, where I live babies are not an issue for most people except yuppies whom everyone else hates for their annoying ways with their children. It solves the problem neatly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not at all self-righteous, but let's also agree that your baby is not a special magical miracle. It is one of the simplest things that you can do. It does not mean that you are suddenly more important than anyone else. Children are a vast minority that are actually less important than adults. <br/>

      Y'see, that's the problem. That is an important issue. A big reason why pressure is exerted to keep network TV impossibly bland and largely inoffensive is because of groups doing it under claims of children. We are one of the most prudish cultures with our media. This is not something that is aimed primarily at children, but at adults who make up the majority of society. We should not have to cater to children, or rather, the whims of scared parents. It's not just hardcore dicking, it's about a fundamental lack of censorship and an adult approach to our mass media.

      Why is the species continuing so important to you? It is really kind of a pointless concept when you think about it. It doesn't affect you at all. It just seems very egotistical at a basic level if you think about it super-duper hard. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Children become an issue because of how many things are done in their names. We continue to child-proof our entire society because people worry about their kids all the damn time. This is the wrong way to do things. This is an inbalanced system where adults suffer at the expense of a much smaller percentage of children who probably wouldn't care or be affected anyways.

      I think you guys are trying too hard to turn this into an argument. But as a point of interest, the fact that you have to make an case for it as a biological imperative shows that said imperative doesn't completely hold sway. That is, something can no longer qualify as a biological imperative if we are capable of both the volition and the means to ignore it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is also the skeptic argument: since you have no way of knowing what will happen after you die, why care? For all you know, the world could be destroyed a week later, and the human race along with it. Or your kid could start working at the Cheetah Room. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I used to identify as child-free; lately I have been thinking there might be some aspects of having a child that I would enjoy, such as making it learn a bunch of languages and teaching it philosophy from an early age. But then again, this would mean it would end up smarter and more cultured than me, and I might resent it. In any case, I'm still not sure it'd be enough to outweigh the whole baby thing and the accompanying change in lifestyle.

      Yeah, I'm pretty much exactly with you on all points. <br/>

I'd like to try raising a child to be smart and well-adjusted without hypocrisy from me as a parent (if you did when you were their age and it didn't have negative consequences you're kind of a jerk to forbid them from doing it and if it was a problem then you should just be honest with them about why it's a really bad idea). At the same time I both don't want a child, don't want the expense of a child, and fear that the child might just plain be an idiot that I absolutely hate (kinda like Little Nephew) regardless of what I do.

 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Biological imperatives are the needs of living organisms required to perpetuate their existence: to survive. Includes the following hierarchy of logical imperatives for a living organism: survival, territorialism, competition, reproduction, quality of life-seeking. Living organisms that do not follow these imperatives are described as maladaptive; those that do are adaptive. Maladaptivity is perhaps the most fundamental criterion for defining abnormality and mental illness.</em></div> <br/> 
So, no offense belgand, but you are abnormal in the technical sense of the word here. As am I, as is achilleselbow should he stick to his original thought pattern. We've all got issues, man. <br/> 
Personally, yeah, I don't see myself in my current mindset having a kid since they take a lot of work to keep alive, they cost a lot of money, they could grow into "an idiot that I absolutely hate", and, shit, what if it turns out they've got some kind of disease? I don't want that, no matter how small the damn chance, not until they get genetic engineering to practically eliminate the chance of that happening, or something like that.

      The survival instinct is also a biological imperative, yet people still commit suicide, as well as do things that bring them close to death. <br/> 
I mean, I cannot think of any kind of biological impulse baser than the survival instinct. If, by your definition ("something can no longer qualify as a biological imperative if we are capable of both the volition and means to ignore it"), the survival instinct does not qualify as a biological imperative, then what does? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Addendum: Maybe I'm wrong, but a biological imperative sounds like a psychological thing, so if something as simple as your heart beating counts, then nevermind. Breathing, eating, etc. are all resistable, though (ex. suffocation and hunger strikes). Perhaps thirst and sleep are the only things that qualify? I cannot think of an example where people willfully go without water or sleep until they die from lack of it.

      Oh I take no offense at being called abnormal. But I think there's still a level of difference between the instincts for survival and procreation. If we're just talking about immediate physical needs, then the biological imperative would just be boning, not necessarily reproducing. Of course, it's only through our manipulation of nature that we've been able to separate the two. But the separation is there, and now that reproduction is a completely voluntary and psychological choice rather than the result of a powerful physical urge, it's hard to place it on the same level of biological imperative as basic survival.

      <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Why do men need to imagine that their sexual object actually has the same interests as them? What does that matter, when it is just something you're imagining fucking, anyway?</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's funny to be a guy saying this to a girl, but for many people sex isn't just about the physical act of fucking, even when it's imaginary. Much of what goes into arousal is psychological, even for us neanderthal guys. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A lot of alt-porn fans say they like it because it's not degrading, the companies are run by women and don't exploit their actresses, and it shows 'real' girls rather than enforcing unrealistic body standards. But those are just the ethical aspects. For me, it is, erm, 'conducive' to see the girls that may for all I know be some girl that lives in my neighborhood and that I would see at the grocery store and be too afraid to talk to, and then she just goes back to her loft and does stuff like this with different guys like  <em>every day</em>  and she'd probably do it with me if I would have just talked to her but I never will because I have issues and she probably wouldn't anyway because I'm so pathetic and ohmygod it is so painful to watch but also so hot and I can't look away... <br/>

      My one experience at a strip club involved a mixed group of friends (at least two couples, more women than men, and no unattached men) going out to a strip club near the Army base. One of the girls danced to Soul Asylum's "Runaway Train". This is the one of the absolute worst songs for a stripper to ever dance to. Not only is the subject matter completely inappropriate and disturbingly connected to the industry, but the beat is far too slow.

      Well, it, of course, started sucking as soon as they graduated. The thing is, Donna is fucking hot like a glob of plasma. It took for her to change into a cheap, trampy, uninteresting-looking bottle-blond before I could manage to pull myself away from what I knew had become a terrible show. That and I watched them all in re-run so it was only maybe one extra month of watching or so.

      I wouldn't say I loved it, but I got hooked on it when it was in re-runs and found it very amusing. The fact that Donna was a stone-cold fox was definitely a reason to keep watching it obsessively. I'd probably watch American Idol if she took her top off in every episode (not true, I'd just find them on the Internet or TiVo it and then skip to the only tolerable bit).

      Strippers actually dance to a number of songs you might find surprising.  Usually, the slinky, writhing-on-the-floor numbers are weird. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For instance, you know that Pearl Jam song that goes like, " <em>she's an empty canvas under shEEts of clay</em> " or something like that? A stripper mainstay, for the more seductive approach. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The grinding on the pole songs are pretty much obvious, and a lot of it depends on what the club's main clientele is.  Urban areas get a lot more hip-hop, rural areas get a lot more classic rock.

      When you're dealing with a young, wan girl who looks only a few steps removed from an American Apparel ad "Runaway Train" is not the best choice of songs. Also, it just has the wrong rhythm. Ignoring the lyrical content it just plain didn't work for the dancing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will never, ever understand stripping to hip-hop or, for that matter, anything about hip-hop that could in any way, shape, or form be expressed as something that is pleasurable or connected to something pleasurable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Since my girlfriend started taking stripping classes I've found that my music collection is woefully inadequate in regards to songs that are appropriate to strip to. She has basically no knowledge of music and owns no CDs so I kinda have to help out with that part. Basically I've been falling back on a lot of Nine Inch Nails and AC/DC. AC/DC are excellent for stripping as it is the primary conceit of most of their songs to begin with. "Hell's Bells", in particular, is, in my opinion, an excellent song to strip to: good steady beat, slow opening to build interest that picks up at just about the right time and otherwise enjoyable to listen to.

      NIN was a favorite of my beloved paracoita, for when she performed. Rammstien's "Du Hast", is probably the song I heard most often in the days I still frequented clubs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Trip-hop and industrial generally works best, although you may want to avoid such works as The Normal's "Warm Leatherette" and NON's... well anything by NON other than "Cleanliness and Order", really.

      Cleanliness and Order would also probably work very poorly, unless I guess they did a thematic interpretation.  I'm of the opinion that most all songs could be danced to, if the lady or gent is having fun with it.  NON pretty much no, though.  Or any noise, pretty much. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thrill Kill Kult is pretty much meant for sleaze, so I'd suggest you download yourself one of their albums.  Any of them would do, I'm sure. <br/>

Also, I've never met a person who didn't have of an opinion on music in the wild, it has to be kind of refreshing.

      Actually it's kind of annoying and problematic. The kind of person who does not know, for example, that Jimi Hendrix was black. And is unable to recognize any of his songs. <br/>

She claims to enjoy music, but I think only in the manner of she enjoys it when it is happening to her, but will never make any effort to actually listen to it on her own or learn anything about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
How can you talk about music when you're dealing with someone who does not know what "Stairway to Heaven" sounds like or who played it? It is like educating a disinterested child. I have to get my musical discussion on the outside.

      Pavement, Mr. Bungle, Man...

      Lou Reed, "Perfect Day" would also be a very terrible song to strip to. Again, too slow combined with lyrics that deal strongly with self-loathing and the need to find a way to drown out the feeling that you are a worthless person. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is, perhaps, the song that Beef must think of in regards to Molly at times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Tom Lehrer songs would also be straight-up wrong and decidedly too geeky as well. A lady who attempts a strip routine to "The Elements", however might well cause me to forget that other women exist. Unless she's a chubbo.

      One time I saw a stripper perform; I don't remember what song it was, but it didn't matter. This girl, she called herself Pyro. She was tall, thin, and had long black hair. Her dance was...well, interesting. She moved all over the place. She climbed up one of the poles on stage (and I don't mean a stripper pole, I mean like a load-bearing pillar in the building) and LOUDLY banged her boots against the pillar. When she was dancing upstairs she climbed and swung on the rafters (until the manager made her stop). She was thrilling.

      The most interesting combination I ever saw was in the film  <em>Exotica</em>  (terrific film by Atom Egoyan).  Mia Kirshner plays a young woman working in a strip club, with her signature act being coming on stage dressed in a school girl uniform and dancing to Leonard Cohen's  <em>Everybody Knows</em> .

      I've never understood drink minimums in places that charge a cover. Why not just charge a cover for the full price you intend and then save money on inventory? Or perhaps it is a marketing concept whereby they wish to artificially lower the cover charge by passing it on elsewhere and assuming you're too dumb to figure the trick out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's ultimately incredibly annoying for me because I do not drink and thus would rather just pay the cover. <br/> 
 <br/> 
From my understanding with other types of clubs with drink minimums basically the waitress will force you into ordering drinks. If you choose not to continue order drinks up to the minimum when she comes by then, yes, you will be asked to leave.

      Drink minimum is a kinder way of charging for the space you are taking up because at least you get something in return, and the club is still making near pure profit on the drinks.  I can see how it would bug you to pay $15 for a couple of cokes, though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The places I have been to that have both a cover and drink minimums are usually shows or comedy clubs where they couldn't charge the whole admission as a drink minimum or it would be something like a 10 drink minimum depicted above.  I don't know how current alcohol laws would even let a club get away with a four drink minimum. <br/> 
 <br/> 
sje - Either they sell you tickets good for drinks at the door, or the waitress takes your order and money for all the drinks as soon as you sit down.  They don't care if you drink them or not.

      I still fundamentally hate the idea of drink minimums. I'd much rather just pay full cover at the door. A lot of comedy clubs are also already charging what is basically a normal price for a cover at the door as it is. If the door is $30-40 there shouldn't be a drink min. as well or you are just straight up raping me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even as cheap as I normally am I don't care about supposedly getting something in return. I want to get the show in return, period. Charge me a full cover with no drink tickets, no minimums, just cover. Fuckknobs.

      Sort of. It is where you remove all of their bones so that they become very floppy and you roll them around the house for fun before putting the bones back in. It's a long, challenging process that you typically only do with someone you love and trust because you don't want someone hiding your bones as a prank. That would be awkward. Nobody wants to have to roll outside and start asking neighbors for help because someone boned you and then hid in the closet as a joke.

      Technically you can't bone him. I mean, maybe you could peg him, but that's it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I believe you meant to state that you would not be open to him boning you. Unless you are into that and just meant that you're not going to bone him which, well, you can't so it's not even an issue. I doubt this to be the case, however. I doubt it very much.

      That is a fundamental reason I never really understood strip clubs. You get less selection than porn, but it's live, but it's also all softcore, but the lady will at least touch you a little bit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, for the cash you're spending it seems like a complete waste and a terrible idea. I don't get paying a lady to be a complete tease.

      Man, I dated a stripper for about a month four years ago. I always thought it would be awesome, but it turned out to be the craziest woman I had ever dated. I don't mean crazy in the traditional sense, but rather in the scary, stalk you and try to kill you sort of way. I will (hopefully) never do that again.

      Man, you want crazy, you should hear about this girl. She was driving up to visit me and I sent her boyfriend-who-I-thought-she'd-broken-up-with-again-fella a little email. Y'know. Internet shit. Didn't tell him any details, just asked him where she had been the time we were naked in a hotel room the last time I was down where they are. Bitch calls me crying and screaming that he asked her who I was, that she thought he knew everything so she admitted it all, he yelled at her until she cried, told all their friends, and that her reputation was ruined, couldn't return to Florida ever, etc. We're talking hysterical here. So I ask the guy if he enjoys being verbally abusive, and it turns out... the conversation she was so hysterical about.... DUN DUN DUN... never actually happened. I ended up telling him everything myself at this point anyway, back from the beginning where I introduced her to achewood and got head from her in an airport when we first met (in person). <br/>

And now they're starting a family, I think. :D

      While he's not my favorite, I don't know why I like the character so much; I mean, he seems like a pretty tossed-off, weak character on the face of it (I kind of picture a Poochy-like creation for Marcula, especially the name: "let's have a dracula-type, always does the exact opposite of a decent person, and give him an absurd name, like 'Marcula'...only funnier"..."So, everyone okay with Marcula then?"). <br/>

      At the tender age of 21 I rescued from my friend's pool house a crow of appreciable durability. Attacked by the pair of guard dogs it had the audacity to continue living. My attempts to nurse it back to health came across its surprising diet - the beat refused to dine on anything other than Wendy's Brand Processed Chicken Nuggets. It devoured such meat with relish, and within the day was escaping its confinement.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
By noon of the following there was no containing it - Cornelius simply refused to respect conventional wisdom, or several of the Laws of Medicine. Veterinary science could find no cure - we were forced to send it back to the wild, were it is presumably king of the crows, and may possibly lead to the Downfall of Man. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Connie here is a king amongst men - defying the wisdom of his years to bask in the illusion of being sought. And yet, though this stripper has come to him seeking money, she will leave longing for the intangible aura of mastery that surrounds the man. And Connie will turn her down - for one brief moment she will stand with a man who has accepted the vices of the world, yet feel no guilt for them.

      Hey Friends <br/> 
 <br/> 
    My name is John, and I love every single one of you. All of you are fit, intelligent, socially experienced people who spend every second of their day being good to eachother. You are everything nice in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten in any trouble? I mean, I guess it's fun helping people because of your own generosity, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even better than being nice to people on facebook <br/> 
 <br/> 
    Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I'm pretty much happy. I was captain of the chess team, and volunteer at the library. What sports do you play, other than "animal shelter helper"? I also am straight edge, and have a moderately attractive spouse (She just wrote me; it was SO nice). You are all buddies who should just love eachother. Thanks for listening. <br/>

      What everyone has seemed to fail to notice is the fine dotted line around the neck of this "bear".  Go take a look!  Clearly, this is the poorly concealed scarring that often accompanies Human-to-Stuffed-Bear head transplants.
