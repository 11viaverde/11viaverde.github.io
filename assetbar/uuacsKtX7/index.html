      It's kind of like that with this forum and Onstad. We look upon his creation in wonder, we aren't sure if he's watching us, and sometimes address him though we cannot know if he is listening. sometimes we make suggestions about his creation but we can only look at things that occur later and wonder if we influenced them and usually guess "probably not". and on rare occasion when he does speak to us it is usually a short and practical message that everyone rushes to respond to hoping something more will come of it, but it never does and we are left wondering. And then you have asherdan, hes like billy ghram, he reinterprets his meanings to us confidently but poorly, and he claims to know Onstad better than any of us, but won't explain how and its pretty clear that he really just wants attention.

      This has been a point of contention in my home since this whole Perky Pervert business began. I knew, of course, that Lyle intended to hold the dildo against the outside of the cup, while my loving girlfriend expected that he would insert the dildo fully into the microfoam. <br/>

      Hopefully, it's rarely someone's intention to get drunk and go on the internet.  I do it occassionally, but it's not premeditated.

      Yah right, I invented some of my best insults while drunk on the internet. One time I came home drunk and apparently flamed someone on the Splinter Cell forums (we'd been playing Splinter Cell Co-op after coming home form the bar). I coined the term "menstrual clot", of which I am both proud and deeply ashamed.

      Doin' it yourself ain't half as kinky.  You know exactly where it's been - the danger, and thus the excitement, is gone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Given that it's an independent coffee shop, the excitement is greater - it COULDA been somewhere nasty.  They aren't as regulated by Health Inspectors, they could get away with it.  When Lyle makes this into a chain, the allure of Dildoing It For A Dollar won't be there - because you can bet the zit-faced teenager behind the counter hasn't done anything funky with it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And that, my friends, is why he'll only hire nymphos, porn stars, and junkies who'll do anything for a score.

      The thing that most concerns me about this is that Lyle found this object, and therefore you have to assume it has been used. I would not drink that coffee for less than $250. And I would feel awful if I did it for less than $500. <br/>

Apparently you are not alone in hating my comment, but for the record, I did not mean it in the vernacular sense, a la Jaime Kennedy saying "Don't be hatin'!"  Jaime Kennedy aspires to be the poor man's Pauly Shore.  Anyway, it was just ill-chosen shorthand for those who express nothing but hate and contempt in their comments, e.g., "this strip sucks, a new low for Achewood, you people are all stupid."  They never seem to like anything, and they yearn for a fallen Golden Age of Achewood, but it's unclear when that happened.   I could have called them "almost-every-strip-since-the-Great-Outdoor-Fight-and-all-the-rest-of-us-sycophantic-know-nothings-haters," but that was too cumbersome.  So fuck it, I went the stupid way.

      Also, Lyle appears to have set his sights a bit too high, as he clearly is not making cappuccinos, but rather is dispensing coffee from an urn. With no foam, there is nothing to make a pleasing shape out of, and thus his only clientèle is perverts, as opposed to those merely seeking a unique crema/microfoam creation.

      Man, Nolan don't even come out with what he wants up front. He doesn't say "dildo it," he "takes advantage of the upgrade." He's so used to getting his kink on from The Internet (where he is from), that the presence of one other dude freaks him out, all trying to be discreet, even in the middle of nowhere, where the only dude who may be fooled knows full well he's about to stick a dildo in Nolan's coffee. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe if his last foray out of The Internet into real-world kink hadn't ended with Ray cussing out Lyle, Nolan might not be such a shut-in today.

      I was under the impression that dildoing the coffee meant sticking it in the coffee to begin with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It doesn't take much perversion or imagination to hold a vibrating dildo against the outside of a styrofoam coffee cup.  My grandmother might be doing that.  Hell, she probably  <em>is</em> .
