      The Nineteen-Eighties were a time of excess, there is no doubt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another time when you watch a new generation of pointless youth rebel against the fashions of ideals from five years previous, only to repeat the same wind-sucking depravity and uselessness of their predecessors.  But due to this, a time when you could buy or sell anything without the slightest hint of candor, and the term "for the right price" was rendered moot.  Materialism was up, and if you wanted something done or a dark part of your life forgotten about, this was the best chance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you had a child that you fathered 18 years ago, who had come knocking on your door demanding something-the-goddamned-what, and you were trying to not let the putrid bastard remains of your own youth infect the hairsprayed 1.2 family in a black-and-white toned plastic and steel house life that you've created since that time, you needed to call someone who was either desperate or experienced or in the current case both, and have them sneak up behind the problem that you've since forgotten the name of but you don't care because you're a soulless and cursed First in This World, who you've told to wait at an ant-infested dirt motel on the outskirts of Gila County, and keep it quiet.  And you don't want to know about the muffled sounds that The Problem makes from the back of their throat, or whether they were excited or scared at the possibility of finally getting to talk to their illegitimate blood parent before their mouths were covered with tape and they beaten into unconsciousness and dragged into the trunk of a rusty sedan. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And you don't want to know about how they were killed (garotted) or where they were buried (in the desert off route 170) or how deep they were buried (they dug it for 3 hours and they had weak university women's wrists) or in what fashion they were buried (upside down so their demonic soul would not escape, but with a cross of St Andrew so their human one may) or what happened to their flesh (cut off and purged to the nearby beasts of the land and birds of the putrid and cold air).  You don't want to know any of this, but as you supply your payment after I interrupt your dinner at a Greek restaurant, I tell you.  You try and convince your children that I am crazy and a vagrant, and when I drag you into the alley and insist you tell your family the truth and your children don't cry because the truth is something to be proud of, to be celebrated, then you start to beg for mercy despite the fact that I am neither the provider of mercy nor the provider of vengeance, nor did I ever claim to be, and I find the assumptions ignorant at best and insulting at worst.  And sometimes I find it in me to listen to your cries and take your family instead, and sometimes I do not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Nineteen-Eighties were a time of excess.  There is no doubt.

      Petty is from Gainesville.  Petty drank/smoked/freebased himself stupid and got screwed by the record company.  I think Lyle's story will parallel his in some ways.  Lemmy is a great comparison for facial hair though.

      You could just post it as a link, y'know, no need to copy and paste at all. Or, since we live in a goddamned modern age where we all use reasonable browsers and such you could install  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413122738/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/190">Linkification</a>  which automagically turns your puny text links into real links that you can just click on.

      I got this impression too, which seems to indicate that Lyle is pretty much bald on top.  <br/> 
He used to have a barnet the same colour as his chops. The chops are still there, but white, while his luxurious upper thatch seems to have disappeared. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lyle's combed-over and sweaty appearance at Beef and Molly's wedding could confirm this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or it might be that I simply don't understand the complex interrelationship of facial/head hair versus the natural covering of fur that's found on anthropomorphic stuffed tigers...

      I gots to say, why not hate on Florida? It's got the Dali Museum on one coast and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413122738/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Castle">Coral Castle</a>  on the other, and nothing else decent. The state's a dick, every one in it is a dick. The entire Florida economy was built on drug running, which sounds cool at first and maybe it used to be but not anymore, oh no sir. People talk about The Everglades like they're some magical prehistoric utopia. It's a swamp. It's a big fucking swamp that used to be The Entire State before the white man drained everything north of Miami. <br/> 
 (Said drainage, by the way, has fucked up the ecosystem possibly beyond repair.) <br/> <br/> <br/> Quick history lesson here. As a child learning the local history of Florida I was told,  <em>with pride,</em>  about how the Seminoles are the only undefeated Indian tribe in the entire country. Why is this? Because the Seminoles used to live in and around the Carolinas, but the white man kept killing them and pushing them farther and farther south until they had nowhere else to go but south Florida. The white man followed them, took one look around and said, "Fuck it." No one wants to live in Florida. It's not even worth killing Indians to live in Florida.  <br/> <br/> <br/> I regularly would find insects in my back yard that science has yet to classify. Love bug season: there are clouds of bugs so thick they blot out the sun, roaming the streets reproducing. Land crab season. What the shit kind of apocalypse is it when crabs, which live in water in case you didn't know, migrate across dry land only to be crushed by the thousands under the treads of SUVs?  <br/> <br/> <br/> Red tide on the Atlantic coast. Red Fucking Tide. The ocean itself is telling people: leave this place or you will breathe toxic fucking algae that grows in the water and kills pets and old people. I am completely serious when I ask, %u201Cwhy not hate on Florida?%u201D What is good, or even un-horrible, about that place?  <br/>

      Wow, I guess I really had that on my chest for a while. Jai alai is kind of cool if you're into sports. I am not into sports.

Jai alai is definitely not what is good about florida. <br/> 
 <br/> 
its actually a beautiful place. that is the main thing. people (not the seminoles) have lived here for thousands of years. if you dont like nature, yeah, what can i say, there are bugs and other animals. and swamps, whats left of them. whats so bad about swamps though? are they scary? do your feet get wet? <br/> 
 <br/> 
thing is, its people who couldnt stand / appreciate nature who drained the state and filled it full of air conditioned golf themed communities. they are the guy who sucks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i dont actually care that achewood takes shots at florida every now and then... its usually hilarious. i appreciate that chris doesnt focus on most of the cliches people usually associate with florida, he usually aims right at the poor, trashy roots. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i guess i just wondered why he picks on us? california and florida have a bunch of things in common, nice climates, beaches, both initially conquistador-colonized, still have ties to latin america... its almost like we are a brother he is ashamed of. Florida is the Showbiz to California's Roast Beef. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Except California's the one thats broke... ha ha! Maybe if you blow through the dough from the pot tax too fast, you can sell some ads on "The World's Website". <br/>

This isnt about which state is better or worse or second or first. I was just asking why he talks about florida at all. Why pick on us? west virginia is the only other state that gets more than a passing one-off mention. but at this point he has launched a full-on attack on FL.

      Well, we have a plural second person, but some people just aren't capable of grasping that it's the same as the singular form. They can discern the number of sheep from context, but they think second person is too hard. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think most people are already pretty OK with using "they" as a gender neutral pronoun even if it is technically incorrect. It works and makes sense. I am fine with saying that it can be singular as well as plural.

      Seriously... this is creeping me out a bit. Not only do we have a bunch of 'barbarians from Gainesville, but a number of others from Florida as well. I mean, shouldn't we have maybe more from Miami at least? I always personally find it odd how few there are from the Bay Area.

      Other things I experienced growing up in Gainesville FL: <br/> 
 <br/> 
I once saw a car accident right in front of my high school (GHS Hurricanes!) where this chick (who was driving a VW Bug) rear-ended this other car knocked a bunch of her front teeth out, and then got out and crawled around the street trying to pick them up, a la Jackie Kennedy on that fateful day in Dallas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had a bass player in the band once express a preference for Sammy Hagar over David Lee Roth in the Van Halen pantheon ("dude, he's a  <em>Top</em>  rocker!").  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had to fire him on the spot.  This was serious business in Gainesville in the 80's.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>You had to pick a side.</em>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I knew yet another Bass player who had a wife who was an awful lot like Darlene.  He was 25, and she was pushing 60 easily, and had a retarded baby because she drank while she was pregnant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sigh. <br/> 
Yeah. <br/> 
Gainesville.

      In Tallahassee, we barbecue gators every year before the Florida / FSU game. Freshwater gator tastes like a shrimp / chicken combo. Gator from the coast tastes more like low-rent lobster.

      This mad emy day.  He's better than me, sure (I have never attempted to play the guitar), but he really tried it in front of a concert, on live TV?!  What a moron.  I love how he leans back slightly in order to get those tricky notes.   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413122738/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Durst">This</a>  is pretty funny too.  Just the whole article.  What a joke.

      it is a bland fibrous, very white meat. When people say alligator tastes like chicken, they mean it tastes like stringy, overcooked, skinless chicken breast. novelty or desperation are the only reasons to eat gator over any other meat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Armadillo is another story though, it tastes like a porkchop.

      I'm not so certain yet. My feelings on this are all over the place. While T's response was ideal I'm worried that this seemed like a cool thing in the "Coming in '09" strip, but it just isn't going to work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically my issue is the same problem you have with grindhouse. The trailers are awesome and you think to yourself, "that trailer is so awesome I must see that film!" even aware of the phenomenon it is hard to resist. But when you actually see it you realize that the  <em>idea</em>  is a lot more interesting than the execution could ever hope to be. You've got five minutes of awesomeness, but you need to stretch the brief sketch out into something whole and it just doesn't work at that level. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, the story of Lyle was already told, or at least, the Genesis of Lyle. I'd link to it, but some other assetbarbarian with better skills will need to find it in the depths. There's no way I can search through these things.

      You should at least start with just some culottes and see if this is really something you want to be doing. If so, I encourage you to move forward with it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Interestingly the first three Google results for culottes included two sites selling "modest clothing" for women and both included the same bible verse commanding such. This is far, far creepier to me than a dude wearing skorts which I basically have no problem with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The example we ought to be setting for girls isn't to wear modest clothing, but wearing revealing clothing that actually makes you look good and not just some cheap skank with no sense of taste.

      Panties? You clearly don't understand how skirts are designed to work. They are intended to be worn sans panties. <br/>

      It is finals week. Students start doing crazy things, especially in the Hell Towers dorms, a 12-story X-wing architectural salute to Stalin. After dark, longhairs begin creeping out on the campus, stoked on psychedelics, for a few leisurely laps around the Towers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the 6th floor, a stressed-out freshman reaches the flashpoint of a semester-long disintegration. He has totally lost focus, can't concentrate in any of his classes, his grades have gone in the toilet, he can never face his stern father now. He is an 18-year old failure at life. <br/> 
 He strips off his clothes, goes out into the 6th floor lobby, and sprints at one of the full-size plate glass windows. <br/> 
 On the sidewalk below, two freaks hear a crashing noise above their heads, and look up to see a naked, hacked body haloed in shards of glass come hurtling down to the concrete with a splatting sound akin to meat being tenderized. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They really, really hope they are hallucinating, but they know in an instant they are not. They are both seeing this, hearing it, smelling it, and know it is not a hallucination, it cannot be a hallucination, although by all rights it should always be only a hallucination they can laugh back into the shadows. They try to laugh. They fail. <br/> 
 What tenuous grip they have on their minds slips away. They thought this was going to be a fine, frosty December night acid trip. They thought wrong. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They end up in the hospital E.R., strongly sedated, gibbering the rest of the night away. And gibbering the next few weeks also. The story is told and retold, becoming part of the lore of the Towers.

      Every time I hear that song it bothers me that while he shot the man in Nevada, he's in a California prison.

Perhaps he meant the general Reno area up to and including Truckee which would make Folsom a pretty reasonable place for him to end up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, nobody is writing a song about "I shot a man in Sparks*". It just doesn't work nearly as well or convey the feeling that Reno brings so perfectly. <br/>

      yeah...  <em>palestine</em> ... let's not even go there. <br/>

so what is up with this lame/chubby thing? <br/> 
 <br/> 
is there anyone here who like myself never gives lames and chubbies?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And is there anyone here who utters a primordial grunt when giving out a lame or a chubby?  Wouldn't that just make the whole interaction more satisfying, if it actually required physical effort to give out a lame or a chubby?  If you had this big button with this 5 pound spring that you had to smack with a billy club to register your lame.  all plugged into your USB port.  The force of the blow all registering proportional lame status. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And for chubbies, well...  That could be an entirely different USB peripheral... basically, so as not to be overly obscene, a simple doughnut shape, with infrared light emitters and sensors on the inner periphery of the doughnut, and you just use whatever is... convenient... to break the light beams, and to register your chubby. <br/>

      Joe Paterno has three years on Bowden.  Crazy is a bit harder to substantiate, but last year at the age of 82 he broke his glasses showing a linebacker how to hit somebody and could barely walk for most of the season after injuring his hip demonstrating an on-side kick and refusing medical attention for three months.  If you say hi to him on campus his response is "Hey kids, how ya's doin?" regardless of whether or not you are actually only one person.

      Technically a bedroom community is one where people only live there, but commute to work and typically spend much of their time elsewhere. It's a kind of even more grim suburb that acknowledges its place. Though not always. In many cases SF is a bedroom community for Silicon Valley as people would rather live here and the real estate down there is apparently rather terrible.

      I think you're saying that mainly because of your own hipster impulses. I don't follow trends (hipster or ironic mocking of mainstream trends), I don't conspicuously avoid things for being popular, I don't wear tight pants, ironic t-shirts, or trucker hats. I have never done coke, I don't smoke, and I don't drink any alcohol let alone PBR. <br/>

      You know, I want to reply like this to belgand  <em>so</em>  often, but I figure it's gotta be old by now, right?  So I don't do it.  But every once in a while, I can't help myself.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I disagree with tgh below; I don't think that belgand is a hipster douchebag, in that he doesn't seem like that much of a hipster (at least in terms of musical taste).  And I don't even think he's really a douchebag.  I kind of think belgand is an alright guy, but god damn...I have several friends who are notorious for being extremely vocal in their personal distaste for many others' preferences, like belgand, but god dammit belgand, you seem to just hate  <em>everything</em> ; you know you sound like Pat, right?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
What kills me is that he seems to have a strong sense of vitriol for things that don't deserve the effort.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the perfect response to belgand is a twist on an old middle school comeback: "do you ever hate anything you  <em>don't</em>  say?"  It's okay to hate things and not tell us about it, belgand.  Maybe we could come to an agreement?  Like, only post about 1 out of every 10 things you disagree with on assetbar?

      belgand aside, I do think that bedroom communities are a bad idea. While rent in them is cheaper than say, Tampa or Orlando, commuting costs and lost time due to the travel itself make them much less of a bargain. Also, they are typically devoid of any public areas for miles; no parks, no libraries, rarely even restaurants (save the occasional Applebees, and I apologize for sounding like a hipster in response to an anti-hipster post, but I hold nothing but bile for applebees and for those whom consider it a good place to be) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I think that these satellite "communities" are pretty much unsustainable, and bleak places to live as well, hopefully the trend will die out soon.

      Are you sure about this?  I read that "suburbia" has stopped growing, and that a lot of people are moving back into cities, because they aren't viewed as the dangerous places they used to be, by well-to-do yuppies.  Growing up on such shows as Seinfield, Friends, and even Hey Arnold, young adults are realizing that the city isn't a place were you will be instantly shot, which so many people try to communicate to you (there's a line of people as soon as you step into Harlem holding knives looking for white people to stab).  These yuppies bring in fresh money, which they use to renovate the city and, well, make it more attractive to yuppies.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, satellite communities, having lived in one, are bleak, sooo bleak.  But I don't see how they are unsustainable. They have been in existence for all of eternity, surviving, and in America the fad started in the 50s, and it's still growing strong.

      They have not been in existence for all of eternity.  They have been in existence since the rise of the housing-price-fueled post-war American Golden Age.  They were sustainable because gasoline and thus travel in the US was functionally free for most of the 20th century.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even though gas prices are low now, that is an artificial result of the current economic crisis.  If something happens somewhere in the world to affect oil production, those prices are going to shoot right back up again.  Which, I don't have to say, would not be good for the world economy right now.  I'm not saying this will happen, but this is just one of a number of scenarios that could further weaken global markets.  Balanced on the head of a pin right now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not a proponent of Peak Oil theory that says we're heading for Mad Max territory, but we are I do believe we are at the beginning of a massive change in human society.  Some will say "Nothing new under the sun" and that we have seen this all before, but that is really only true at the small scale. Day to day human beings will always fall in love and be petty and lie and be nice and complicated.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, if you take a look at the flow of history, the composure of society changes an awful lot, and at an increasingly rapid pace.  And, I'm not saying Obama will necessarily be Lincoln or FDR, he could be a whole 'nother level of horrifying incompetence, though I don't believe he will.  This could all go for the worse rather than for the better.  But I don't think that, either.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Regardless of the people who compose society, as a whole we are hitting tangible limits to the expansion of the human organism.  Shit is about to get real, for good or for ill. <br/>

      Come to think about it, it is impractical to live in a watershed community before the invention of the car.  I was thinking that the Romans lived in suburbs.  Not suburbs as we viewed them today, but small localities outside a major city.  This may be true, but what makes a bedroom community a bedroom community is the fact that most people don't work there but commute to work, and only sleep and eat in the town.  But they never had cars, so I guess you're right.  I think there were certainly "suburbs" (in some sense) since shortly after the first cities were formed, but bedroom communites are new.  My apologies.

      The problem is that the wealthy yuppies are driving out the middle class and generally a lot of the people that are responsible for the sorts of things that caused them to want to move to the city in the first place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You move to the city when you're young and you get by because you're still student-poor, but as you start making more money you often find yourself running into the wall that is increasingly stratifying cities into just the poor and the wealthy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that while there has been a definite increase in cities the flight of the middle class is still happening at a serious rate and it's only getting worse. Especially for people who want to have children it's often just not financially possible to live in the city. Local rent tend to be around $1,600-2,000 for a one bedroom rising up to $2,500-3,000 for a two bedroom. From what I could tell New York is running at around $3,500 for a two bedroom. Even with high house prices you're really pushing at the limits there and that's not factoring in quality of schools and the general increased cost of living in most major cities. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If things continue the gentrification is going to push people back out to the suburbs until, hopefully, that makes the cities less desirable for the yuppies as well and increases the number of rental properties to bring things back to the way they were in the last major epidemic of suburban flight when rental property was cheap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the same time most places tend to follow a path: first they're cheap so young people tend to move there, the area becomes trendy and rents go up, now that the area is trendy the yuppies move in and gentrify it until it is no longer either particularly trendy or affordable. This has happened many times before, just looking locally North Beach, The Haight, The Castro, and The Mission (still gentrifying) have all had this problem. The problem is that I can't think of any places that have returned from this fate. There is apparently no bust in the cycle or, at least, it simply hasn't occurred yet in any place I can think of. As the middle class moves out the wealthy move in and they tend to stay being replaced by future waves of yuppies.

      That's happening to Washington, DC now. The neighborhoods that are typically considered "bad neighborhoods" are getting more and more high rise luxury apartment buildings. I would rather not have to move out of the city and commute to work, but that is looking more and more like what I'll have to do. <br/>

      Locally one of the worst places in town (over by the old Navy shipyard that is now a Superfund site and apparently one of the most polluted places in the country) that is primarily black was able to push through a ballot measure allowing Lennar to begin turning it into high-rise luxury condos. There was a lot of push to make more affordable units, but instead they claimed that if they did that it wouldn't be profitable and they would pull out leaving us with a decrepit pit. Their definition of affordable, in this case, being something like 120-140% of the median income and planned to sell at around half a million. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It passed after they spent $3 million pushing it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Many local residents in the opposition claimed it was racist and an attempt to drive blacks out of the city. I think they had it a bit wrong. I doubt they care even the slightest about race. It's just about money. They want to push poor people out of the city because they're not profitable enough.

      Tangential to this, Gainesville is also home to a superfund site. A few years ago the EPA shut down a pressure treated wood plant after an inspection showed soil at the site to be 600% over the legal threshold for arsenic.  <br/>

The fun part is that the property is about a mile from the city water pumps and rainwater drains into the headwaters of several area streams.

      I'm a bit amazed that my earlier post really lead to this much. That is basically what I was trying to say. That bedroom communities tend to be sort of barren and places that exist more or less entirely to be a little more than place where you can sleep at night (hence the name). Suburbs are generally actual communities, but bedroom communities are a mutant sort that exist only in the shadow of serving another area.

      I grew up in the bedroom community of Chester NH, and honestly, it is such a boring place to live.  The only entertainment to be had outside your house is walking in the woods, or going to the gun range.  Otherwise you'd have to drive twenty-five minutes to the next town to go see a movie or go bowling.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The funny thing is that the people who live in small towns like mine tend to be people from cities.  Not necessarily large cities, but those who grew up in Manchester or Lawrence, or Springfield, etc, tend to not like it, and want to get away, and thus decide to live in a house completely surrounded by trees eight miles away from the closest store.  Yeah, your kid is going to be safe (except for tripping on mushrooms in the middle of the woods every day after school, but that's a few years from now), but your kid is also not going to have any social life and a dearth of valuable childhood memories. <br/> 
All while the parents are going "Oh, this area is so good!  My child won't ever get involved with gangs or drugs out here!" all while their brat is having sex out in the woods, collecting more guns than the entire police department, and trying Triple Cs for the first time.

      You make a valid point. I think the things that I deeply love sometimes become overshadowed. I will try to make a greater effort to focus on those in the future. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for an overly-strong sense of vitriol, well, it's something I typically do and have done for years. I intentionally over-state things for comedic effect. Perhaps it is an issue of the medium that prevents that from coming through effectively. Unlike Pat I'm not actually a dick about things and I have a sense of humor about myself.

      I noticed. It makes sense though, movies involving pedophilia and rape amongst small children generally don't see wide release, not that this did but they  <em>are</em>  making an English-language version, not that I think they should but it will draw attention to the original, which was released unceremoniously and the guy actually gave me a slip of paper informing me about preorders for  <em>Twilight</em>  and I wanted to kill him right there.

      It made most critics top ten lists, was a wide favorite to win Best Foreign Film (but wasn't eligible this year... just barely too late IIRC), and locally it's been running at a nearby theater that does a lot of second run stuff in a pizza/pub theater format for about two months or so at least. I guess it doesn't have the attention that a big-budget mainstream version would have, but it's still getting as much attention as an intelligent foreign-language vampire film is going to get. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I believe the English remake was started before it even was released here. It will be terrible I suspect. Another film I really wanted to see last year or so at the local independent film festival  <em>Paranormal Activity</em>  did so well in very early festival releases that it was bought up, the distributor then prevented it from being shown at other festivals (why I missed it) and planned not to release it in favor of a remake. Considering it was based around a found-footage concept of a haunting remaking it was basically the single dumbest idea they could ever make. Well, after deciding not to show it any more at festivals. Apparently it is now supposed to be released... eventually. Of course, the last time there was a found footage concept for a low-budget film with plenty of solid early reviews hyping it up we got  <em>The Blair Witch</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oddly the removal of the pedophilia subplot and such, well, from what I've read about them it added to the film. If they kept the more explicit explanation for her helper it would hurt the ending by not allowing enough ambiguity. I'm not always a huge fan of ambiguity, but this is one of the cases (much like  <em>Oldboy</em> ) where it really works. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I keep hearing people talking about how original and interesting the pool scene was. I don't know what's up with that though. It was cool, yes, but it also felt sort of obvious. I knew exactly what was going to happen as soon as the brother mentioned holding him underwater. I was perfectly correct.

      It was a good film and it was a good vampire film, but it was not OMG BEST FILM EVARS!!1!1!! It's just a hard film to say something bad about because it was so generally good. <br/>

Don't go in expecting a blowjob from Scarlett Johansson while driving a jetski at unsafe speeds, but a solid film that will leave you saying "That was good. I enjoyed that."

Anyway, since I still subscribe to the "all the trolls on Assetbar are other webcomic writers, everything is either Randall Munroe (who I have pinned for aiu anyway) or Joey Comeau of A Softer World fame (purely based on the fact that the earlier prose works of everything match up slightly to Comeau's work).

      Really?  Randall Munroe as aiu? <br/> 
I don't know the man personally, but I really really don't think it's his style.  HE goes on 4chan, obviously, but he seems pretty anti-troll to me.  He's too rational and nice to be a douche to people who really did nothing bad.  Adn yes, I think this comes across from his comics.  IF people were being douches about feminism, or something else sociological, however, then maybe he would troll, but honestly I think he wouldn't troll, but have a direct conversation.  Also, I have the feeling he has no idea what assetbar is.  He led me to believe he doesn't realize how much of the Achewood community despises him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like the theory put forward that gladdi8orrex is Onstad though.  I can see that.  I doubt it, but I can see it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, it is true that all posters here are secretly webcomic artists.  I, for example, am Kris Wilson.

      If he really is aiu it would just be an act and not who he really is, obviously. A lot of the TaBB artists link to Achewood on their sites so the chances of some of the posters here being popular webcomic artists is pretty high. <br/>

      And  <em>Fire Walk with Me</em>  is hardly an "art house" movie. I saw it in a garish-ass megaplex that had an arcade and a go-cart track. The sounds of  <em>Ferngully</em>  bled in like candy-colored poison from the adjoining theater.

      This is entirely correct. When it was first on TV  <em>Twin Peaks</em>  was astoundingly popular. If you want "art house" Lynch you are looking in the direction of  <em>Inland Empire</em>  or such, not his more popular works that you could always easily find at any damn Blockbuster.

      I totally concur with Onstad as Glad.  Glad's characterization is deep and layered, Onstad style.  Also, given how quickly Glad became a sensation upon his arrival, something about his character gelled with the denizens of the board in a meaningful way.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Case in point, I think edwell made a photoshop using Achewood panels out of one of Glad's post with the [o]<---tie fighter reference about two or three weeks after Glad first appeared.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
A normal troll would show weaknesses and human characteristics and a deep desire for recognition.  Only someone already receiving recognition would be able to keep up the facade for so long.  Even The Good Doctor Manflesh eventually showed a part of his true self to the boards.  Plus, a few days ago, Glad commented on a post of mine about the definition of a "poker wheel", and Onstad himself posted a only a minute later to explain the definition. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All circumstantial, but I think compelling. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I report, you decide.

      I'm not sold, but you raise some interesting points that, if nothing else, highlight why glad is so popular. Not to be a dick, but I've never really been a fan because misspelling really pushes my buttons, but even I have been shown to fall prey to his spell (mainly just to take away one of the few things that TGH ever had despite not wanting it myself... now that I think about it I kind of feel bad about that, but I shall continue to view it more as a gentle tweaking of his aging shtick that gracefully retired it). Glad does show remarkable ability to hold to his persona and often tries to move conversations into new and interesting areas as opposed to letting us just continue navel-gazing, harassing one another, getting into irresolvable philosophic arguments, and endlessly quoting things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He also posts sparsely while most other trolls would be omnipresent. He is more of a conversation starter than a participant pausing only occasionally to make a limited number of responses. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't yet buy it, but you have a strong case and, at the very least, a compelling reason for why he is so beloved.

      I mean, if you aren't staying in character, you're failing at trolling. I've done a little trolling in my time, and if you have a specific persona and aren't just posting ridiculous things like Manflesh did, there's a few rules you have to follow to make it successful: don't drop character (seriously, that defeats the entire purpose), make your persona believable and relatable, and vary your methods and levels of offensiveness. These are basic. This does not make Glad' 'Stad, it makes him an experienced troll.

I  <em>really</em>  am!  I just did it for a lark,  <em>pretending</em>  I'm a psychopath!" <br/> 
Of course, what aiu did isn't nearly as bad as that, but the point is that Randall wouldn't do that action.  He thinks that whether or not you are fundamentally a good person or not is irrelevant if you are doing immoral things--and I knw this because his dang best friends are obsessed with sociology, and I can only assume he has a similar mind.  Unless he thinks that everyone will understand it's a joke (which no one thinks), he woulodn't act this way, because then he would be a troll, just like how the guy in my example is a murderer whether he realizes it or not. <br/> 
But Onstad being glad I can see, because glad isn't really offensive, and the offensive things he says are quickly forgotten about.

      Hey now, you seem a little upset.  I really thought you were seriously considering that aiu is Randall, and if it was a joke, it wasn't a very obvious one.   <br/> 
I didn't say he was a god, I just said that he wouldn't do this.  And of course he can do whatever he wants.  Did I say he couldn't.  I said that he wouldn't.  Like, he wouldn't  <em>choose</em>  to.  I don't worship any webcomic artists.   <br/>

Panel 3: T-Rex: Since about half the stuff Joey Comeau writes is Joey Comeau fanfiction! Am I right, Dromiceiomimus? <br/> 
T-Rex: I guess. Kind of. Does it count as fanfiction if it's him? I guess it's not really "canon," so that means it counts! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Panel 4: T-Rex: On the other hand, if J.K. Rowling wrote a non-canon Harry/Draco story, it wouldn't count, because she's not a "fan" of her own work! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Utahraptor: T-Rex, this is a really boring way to talk about fanfiction! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Panel 5: T-Rex: What? It's AWESOME. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Utahraptor: But you're completely ignoring the more interesting questions! For instance, there's the copyright issue of whether it's disallowed as a derivative work, or protected under parody! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Panel 6: Utahraptor: And then there's the gender-studies issue of why fanfic authors are disproportionately teenaged girls... <br/> 
 <br/> 
T-Rex (thought bubble): I only wanted Joey Comeau's hot sperms <br/>

      Mud Crutch, which is even worse than Mud Pooters. His band was originally called Mud Crutch. What follows is a  <strong>True Story.</strong>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Back in the day, Bobby B. was in a pretty hot band. This was a couple years before Bobby and Jim went to Dallas and formed a sort of Prog-Country group, but some 10-12 years after his drummer turned down playing with a bunch of high-school kids because he thought the name Doobie Brothers sucked. <br/> 
 Bobby, of course, played bass. He always did. And his group were in the finals of a Battle of Bands sponsored by Leon Russell, and they  <em>knew</em>  they werethe best group. <br/> 
 They'd heard the other band, who were from Florida, and those guys had pretty much nothing but a whiny singer who they could sort of keep the beat behind. <br/> 
On the other hand, Bobby's lead guitarist fairly smoldered, and the winner would get a recording contract with Leon's own label, Asylum. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This was as much of a done deal as could be imagined. <br/> 
 Except the night before their finals set, their hot guitarist had an epiphamy, and found Jesus in his hotel room, and put down his axe for good. And the following day, they were screwed. <br/> 
 You cannot play a set in a band based on a terrific guitar player if you have no guitar player. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So the other group won pretty much by default, and got the record contract with Asylum Records. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Leon's people convinced them to change their name from Mud Crutch to Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, and the rest you know.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
You may think that would be the lowest like bad fiction, but Bobby's life took a turn for the far worse, like really bad horror fiction some years later. <br/> 
 After the episode with having to kill that psycho from work in his own apartment, Bobby drifted predictably into heroin. He never went to jail, it was totally justifiable, but it totally fucked him up. He just happened to leave his porch light on, and  <em>Trouble</em>  found him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Bobby today is probably alot like Lyle, living in the wreckage of the past; but at least he had a real shot and took a swing at it, he wasn't some lowlife piece of trash, start to finish.

      I've seen many urban drive-thrus where you need go down a side street, pull into a weird little alleyway that is not always well-marked and drive, more or less, through the building before being deposited on another street altogether where you are likely not easily able to get back on the street you started on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
People fought the McDonald's at the end of Haight putting in a drive-thru so now they just have a ludicrously large parking lot. It still seems incredibly weird to me to have one there, but I guess it mainly does business with the homeless and tourists. The front is definitely one of the more popular homeless gathering spots.

      No, but while there is a model that ejaculates it is not full size. It has been reduced implying that the sort of person who purchases a replica horse penis that will ejaculate in them is not quite up to the idea of it being very large. I think perhaps they need to rethink that part.

      I loved that show but wouldn't get to watch it every day, so I would always end up watching the middle part of a story arc without seeing how it started or how it ended.  <br/>

The last episode I ever saw involved a kid trapped inside a closet and some other freaky shenanigans, and I never saw how it resolved so I always assumed she just was stuck there forever. <br/>

There were 50 episodes. It originally ran for three years, but they then kept it on in reruns until 2001. This means that, since it ran every afternoon, it would only take ten weeks to run through the entire series so yeah, every two and a half months it would start over again. <br/>

      I saw a frighteningly large amount of Wishbone because my mother would leave PBS on for the bird (a cockatoo) to watch while she was gone during the day and Wishbone was always on when I got home from school. Once or twice I found myself getting drawn into it and watching part of an episode. It was always interesting to watch it considering I'd usually read the book. It was surprisingly accurate much of the time.

      I was at a party last weekend and the numbers were dwindling down as the hours reached past midnight and the hostess said "Let's play a game where we all come up with plausible new names for each other" and my friend suggested that I be called Derek and I was all drunk and said "You give me the name of the one black guy on Barney and Friends?! Fuck you!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Derek was a weak-ass attempt at diversity; a version of Steve Urkel for kids. It was like adults were saying "Hey black kids! You don't have to be a drug-dealing gangster!  <em>You can be a nerd, too!</em> " <br/>

      Well, she does make a point. Why should Onstad's child come before her?  <br/> 
She was first in his life. She faithfully followed achewood long before he had that child, and she does not want to have to pay $ for it now*, nor does she wish to pay what amounts to child support for a child she never conceived. <br/> 
This is a serious betrayal.  <br/> <br/> <br/> * She will have to pay far more in the future for the therapy sessions.

On a slightly related note,  <em>Let The Right One In</em>  is ten kinds of awesome. I've always been a fan of vampire flicks (minus that wretched  <em>Twilight</em>  bullshit) so I was pleasantly happy that  <em>LTROI</em>  nailed all the aspects of the classic vampire without seeming overwrought.

      Yeah, that is really never an issue for me. My first time was not spent worrying that she was going to bite or something so much as it was consumed with "I thought this she just wanted to take her top off and make out, but this is a completely awesome turn of events". All rounding second and then she just goes and steals third.

      Not to be a dick about terms but to TOTALLY be a dick about terms, if she's rounding second then I assume she has the intention of taking third, so I think you mean rounding first, advanced to second and stole third.  Or if she was rounding first and advanced to third, then she probably slapped a grounder the other way and split the fielders (playing too shallow) and she was able to advance to third.  IS THAT HOW YOUR SEX BASEBALL WENT.

      I have no idea what in the hell you're even talking about now. Not in sex and not in baseball. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Only sport I think isn't a tool of Satan is roller derby and that's only on account of it not so much being a sport as a way to watch sexy ladies in hot pants and kneesocks with themed costumes hit each other very hard on roller skates. Sexy ladies who probably have feelings for psychobilly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
She was at second already, but when she started leading off the base and making a move towards third the whole defense was just too stunned that such a bold move was being attempted at all. She just sauntered right in and took it in a head-first dive. By the time the dust settled there was a warm washcloth there. <br/>

It was like the end of  <em>The Natural</em>  except everything about it wasn't terrible.

      You're simply having issues separating the conceptual nature of things from reality. Put another way cheerleaders are, theoretically, supposed to be hot, but this is not always true. Not even remotely true in some cases. Does it diminish their fundamental nature? I say not.

      ShEvil Dead have a better name and theme, but the team pic on the site was much more supportive of NOW's thesis. Richmond didn't have a full team pic that was easy to call up, so the Outlaws were the easy compromise. Also, despite the better name and theme, SF has been coming up quite short so far. 98 pt loss on Saturday? Disgraceful.

      I still follow the classic base system of "french, fondle, finger, fuck". I have, however, been willing to accept the modern variant where we have dual usage of "finger/fellatio" when the situation warrants it. The difference generally has to be determined by context and usage, but the hand-head axis is more of a grey zone these days.

      I attribute this, partially, to you being younger. We'll need some input from our elders, but in the old days simply getting a chance to finger-bang a comely young lass was pretty damn important and much like the modern standing blowjorbs seem to have. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, if we go even further back we have (or so I am told) ladies who do not go down at all. Into this system it is a slightly kinky, non-standard practice and you're lucky to find someone into it. This is what I mean when I say "anal is the new oral" it is rapidly approaching the same status that oral now has where it is a basic thing that is done by most people who are not creepy prudes. Sadly, it seems like your generation is generally leading the charge on this one and we're increasingly getting left behind.

      It's already a sin to have sodomy anyways.  OR to spill seed or ejaculate in any way that won't end up in your wife.  Maybe if fundies weren't so stupid they'd realize this, and stop being hypocrits, by either giving up their fundamentalism or stop having sex.  You can't have it both ways.

      I'm not disagreeing with you, but, well, we need a Venn diagram here. "Only in the ass", "Only in the Vagemite" and "All Access". The problem is that there are a lot of girls falling into the "NO ANAL" side of things and that's not cool. Should we then be so opposed to girls who are simply all anal? Yes, they're doing it for crazy, illogical reasons, but what's wrong with benefiting from their dementia? <br/> 
 <br/> 
As well, in the past these girls wouldn't even flirt with trying to keep it technical. They would be all about "a boy looked at you in the eyes and now you are going to hell because he probably had sinful thoughts on his mind".

      The bad part about this arc is I can already tell you how it ends. Teador and Lyle take a trip to Florida,  <em>Fear and Loathing</em> -style, hilarity ensues, they head back to California. <br/>
