      I had a dream one time where Pope John Paul II could not only turn the host into the flesh of Christ, but could also turn any object into the host, or at least into bread. He'd bless a clock and mutter and then WHAM clock made of bread. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I recall some part of the dream where he faced down an army and turned a soldier's arms into bread and then tore them off, then turned the barrel of a tank into bread, etc. You can see where this is going. All in all, Dream Pope kicked a lot of ass.

      A rhetorical question is meant to assert something by letting the listener mull over the answer in his own mind. To that end, it's something that has an obvious answer. Everyone knows that bears shit in the woods, which is why it can be asked rhetorically in place of simply saying "yes." When you change the question to "why", you lose that aspect. <br/>

Don't deny it - if you were a kid then,  <em>you'd</em>  be all over that sweet Hitler Youth crap, too.  Or your parents would make you go in order for them to have some hot sweaty private German parent-time.  They had pocket knives and went camping and shit!

      Three things occured to me as I read this, <br/>

a/ underwear with "Void if Removed" printed on them <br/>

b/ Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, I have no idea what that could mean <br/>

and c/ Nietzsche "When you stare into the void long enough the void stares back at you." but i realise that the actual quote uses the abyss not the void. It is just plain rude to refer to a ldies parts as "abyssal".

Also, for those not familiar with it, it's by the Legendary K.O-- George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People. It's an amazing song and you should go buy it.

      Perhaps a fanbase fascination with Achewood apparel may lead to an Achewood fashion line...  I don't mean t-shirts whose art has character, I mean shirts and pants and such whose very design is the character. <br/>

The Ray Smuckles thong. <br/>

      I suppose this is my cue, as the oldest human here, ahem, digestion does not necessarily deteriorate with age.  Nor does control of the anal sphincter.   <em>(I know, good band name.)</em>   Taste does fade, however, so seeking hot, spicy things like chili would be a good thing,and the cheaper the better due to old age being a fixed income sort of thing for most.

      Yes it was sarcastic.  I don't know if it was misplaced.  Reading your comment and the one it is a reply to caused me to visualize someone seeing a veteran in public and passing judgement on him or her based on what war he or she is thought to have served in.  Idea makes me very angry, and I posted kind of reflexively. <br/> 
 <br/> 
War is killing foreigners for political purposes.  All wars are "morally questionable."  If you can't think of a reason to question one, don't worry, someone else has. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hope that no matter what you think of a particular war, you would give the benefit of the doubt to people went to fight it.

      Your visualizations are your own problem. I said the wars were morally questionable, not the veterans. But if you can't see the essential difference between WWII and Vietnam/Korea/Iraq, then this discussion isn't really worth continuing.

      Anyway, what do you even mean by "the benefit of the doubt"? This is what nobody seems to get. Veterans of WWII should rightly be recognized as heroes because they fought in a war that most sane people now agree was necessary to prevent the subjugation of Europe and the slaughtering of an entire race. Seeing how all of our post-WWII conflicts had nothing to do with national defense, were driven by shadowy geopolitical aims, and are now considered mistakes by most people, I don't see why those veterans should be given the same 'hero' status. At best, they were involuntarily conscripted and were helpless victims who deserve sympathy. At worst, they bought into the jingoism and voluntarily helped the misguided war effort, in which case one can only perhaps say that they didn't know any better. So while they're no more worthy of contempt than the average person, this is hardly a reason for worship or special status in society. Especially since the end of conscription has effectively removed the first category, soldiers are now essentially employees of a corporation who sign up to do a particular job - a job that most Americans now happen to disagree with. Explain again why they should be lauded for it?

      You're right, soldiers are now volunteers, same as firemen and police, and should be given the same respect.  They risk their lives to protect us.  While you may not see or understand the threat, obviously those in power do.  So while blacks might feel the police are against them and many may disagree about the war in Irag, those who are willing to put their lives on the line deserve respect.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, according to a book you might like (and title)  <em>Shield of Achilles,</em> , Korea and Vietnam were part of The Long War we fought against communist totalitarianism nearly all of the last century, a war we [the Western parliamentary democracies] won.

      I'm not sure I agree with this.  I don't feel it was the proxy wars that stopped the spread, but other factors.  Communism's basic flaw was not taking human nature into account.  This is often overstated, but it dovetails in the main reason communism failed.  The emergence of the world economy is what killed communism because the leaders in those countries saw economic opportunities they could not pass up in the world market, look at China and Russia's economy if you need miriad examples.  Vietnam also moved to an open market economy after their war with China.  Finally, I will grant you that the wars did not do any good for communism, but it was not something that they could not survive.  It was economics that brought down communism, not the wars themselves. <br/> 
That's oversimplified of course.

      The economic aspect is very important, and people do lose faith in a system that makes them stand in line for bread.  But one could say that war is an extension of economics, and if the Communists couldn't bury us economically, they were set to do it through warfare.

      You've never been poor in your life have you?  If you had you would have, at one point or another, considered the military.  You're also probably young enough where you've never had to whore yourself out to a major corporation you disagreed with either.  Either way you would know better than to publically criticize the workers for what the managers are doing.  Most of us out here in the real world don't like that much, because it demonstrates the fact that you have no sympathy for the pain of the adult decision of having to choose between economics and ideals.

      Well, I think that most people in america can find jobs that don't involve killing innocent people for no good reason. It might pay relatively well, but I don't think that changes anything. Those people signed up for violence, and got violence.

      I cannot pretend to know, or even begin to comprehend, the ins and outs of the daily grind for soldiers in Iraq, but I have enough faith in the majority of humanity (maybe misplaced) that I do not think American soldiers go out of their way to kill innocent people for no good reason.  I think political leaders might do this, but I do not think the soldiers do it.  I can see where you could argue that there is a certain percent of the soldiers who really truly enjoy killing, but I cannot think they are that numerous.  As for finding other jobs well I admit that's true, but our culture has made taking those jobs a social stigma.  I mean, working at McDonalds is a joke to us, but being in the military gets you respect.  Is respect worth the risk?

      I appreciate poster history's ability to have compassion instead of contempt.  I think he overstates the importance of personal economic circumstances to why people join the US military.  I find it to be a sort of "cheap grace" for people to enjoy an affluent Western existence and deny the role of violence in preserving it.

      Yes, I did overstate it.  Certainly there are many other reasons for joining the military which I did not include.  Frankly the real point of my post was to show that there were other points of view from the one espoused by the original poster.  I also have little patience for contempt for any segment of society.  Violence is a subject I generally avoid, but do not mistake my reluctance to give it a central place in my posts for an ignorance of its place in society.  Our economics, our cultural identity, the relationship between our citizens and our government, and the relationship between our government and other governments all rely on violence.  I am just a person who naturally tends towards the diplomatic, and so violence is the last card I play in any given hand is all.

      WWII is a weird one for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like - if it never happened, and I just wrote the basic idea as a story, it would be dismissed as low pulp at best.  It's when reality mimicked comics of the time - the bad guys (the Nazis specifically) were  <em>obviously</em>  bad, did ridiculously awful shit, were  <em>genuinely</em>  trying to take over the world, were getting up to WEIRD HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION, had an Eagle's Nest for the leader on top of a mountain filled with treasures and wine, and even teamed up with the other Bad Guys to form a League of Super-Villians! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Regardless of the Allies other motives, and all the nasty war crimes the Allies got up to (particularly once it got into the Pacific.  See:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II">Dresden area bombing</a> ,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mutilation_of_Japanese_War_Dead">head-hunting and body mutilation in the Pacific</a> ,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki">The Most Famous Ally War Crime of All</a> ,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_war_crimes_during_World_War_II#Mutilation_of_Japanese_war_dead">a bunch of other stuff</a> ,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes_%28WWII%29">and let's not get started on the Soviets</a> ) - for once, you can look back and go "yeah, the good guys won."* <br/> 
 <br/> 
And really, that's why the American media has romanticised it - it was complicated and there were hell of shades of grey as to the reasoning behind it, for sure; but by and large, in hindsight the black & white concepts of Good & Evil fit into the story pretty well.  When it's just something that the majority of the rest of the world would rather forget. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus, with the amount of fucking  <strong>media</strong>  America makes out of it, showing what a great sacrifice the soldiers gave, you'd think half the damn population of the US died over there.  However,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties">if you take a look</a>   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:World_War_II_Casualties.svg">at the figures...</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
So yes - by and large, as wars go, WWII was a Just War.**  Nazi Germany were bad, Italy was pretty bad (my knowledge there is limited), and Japan was genuinely trying to take over their part of the world, too.  Certainly more easily justified than any of the other crap that the Allies have since entered into. <br/> <br/> <br/> *In hindsight, of course.  At the time, most people couldn't even  <em>imagine</em>  anything like Nazi death camps.  I mean,  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">why the fuck would you do that????</span> <br/> <br/> <br/> **Interestingly, it could be argued that Hitler's initial reason for the invasion of Poland was also a Just War.  That section of Poland was originally part of what was then Prussia, which was made Poland - along with all new applicants from further in Poland -  by the Allies after the First World War (see also: Iraq, Israel/Palestine.  IT NEVER WORKS).  Hitler, it could be argued, was just taking it back, plus of course using the idea of "restoring Germany to its proper glory" as a selling point to the German people - they ate that shit up.  But after he said he wouldn't invade Czechslovakia, and then  <em>did anyway</em> , the rest of the world was sick of his bullshit.  As for how he actually went about invading Poland and any of the other stuff that was done by the Nazis, well that's fucking obvious that it can't be justified.

      History, of course, did not begin with Hitler's invasion of Poland (totally unjustified, by the way).  And what makes WWII morally undefensible is WWI and the reparations that were demanded of Germany, leading to hyperinflation and other economic chaos, leading to the rise of the National Socialists, you get the picture.

      Well said.  No war is an island, something always lead onto another, etc, and generally in the end most of the people who came to the party made a piece of the Guilt Pie (my knowledge of WWI is limited at best - it had something to do with a king...and a bomb...and then some other stuff happened...and then the Red Baron and Gallipoli and Attaturk and spiked helmets, right?  Seriously, I try to get my head around it all*, and I give up.).  And, of course, the Allies had no idea about the Nazi death camps until they found them, so they couldn't have gone in for those reasons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That having been said, however - regardless of the reasons  <em>why</em>  the National Socialist party got into power, what they were doing was still not cool.  And my lack of knowledge of the Sino-Japanese War means I'm not entirely sure of Japan's reasons for invading South-East Asia, but the fact that they attacked Darwin and sent a submarine into Sydney Harbour makes me think Australia had good reason to fight them off in New Guinea. <br/> 
 <br/> 
.....Aaaaaand my knowledge ends.  People can truly spend years studying this crap.  I just like looking up random facts and all the crazy stuff.  ( <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Habakkuk">See Project Habakkuk.</a>   It seems like something off GI Joe.) <br/> <br/> <br/> *I don't really try very hard.

      Many quite interesting books have been written about what WWI was all about, and for, and who caused it and why.  Every generation makes up its own mind about this.  First we all thought it was the Germans, then we thought it was militarism, then we thought it was imperialism, then we thought it was the treaty system, then we thought it was the Serbians or the Austrians. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nowadays people seem to be concluding "all of the above," which strikes me as a cop-out.  I choose to blame it all on George W. Bush or Bill Walton, depending on my mood, positions which are more fun to defend in arguments at bars.

      Well, with my name on assetbar, I probably should weigh in on this, and also point out my degrees, useless as they may be, are in history.  Love the discussion.  You and Pogo covered all the highlights well.  I liked your point as to why there was so much media coverage, but also don't forget WWII got a lot of media coverage because that was what got ratings.  The world war II generation had money and were in a great economic position all the way through the 90s, so they were a target audience for programming (Bill Clinton was the first Baby Boomer Pres in 1992, and that makes a convenient if not entirely accurate line).  You will notice, and I don't have numbers, that there have been less WWII things and more Vietnam/modern weapons things on TV since around 2000 because there is a new big spending generation now.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, from our perspective today of black and white and good and evil, please keep in mind that that does not exist in a vaccuum either.  Our ideas of right and wrong are informed by the experiences of our ancestors and the stories they tell, whether those stories are acurate or not.  Historians try to shape our ideas of right and wrong by trying to verify or debunk stories.  However, like everyone else they are subject to perspective as well.  Its a tricky problem.

      Its slow at work, so unfortunately you get to hear from me again.  I would say the truth of your statement about the victors writing history is being challenged by events.  Now, we can find the lost musings of the losers and have a historian trying to make a name for himself add them to our collective story via mass communications.  An example of this is how all of the former colonies in Africa and Asia are now letting us know about the experiences of colonialism despite not being the victors of that situation.  There is a genuine struggle going on in the English school system as to how to teach history, because they cannot decide whether to teach that the Empire was glorious or oppresive.  So I guess we'll see which one wins.

      Okay, on the Pacific side, we were attacked, or at least a remote island base we probably didn't deserve any more than the Japanese would have since it was the Hawaiian's home until white people gave them diseases was bombed.  I guess that calls for retaliation.  But on the Atlantic side, what's up with that?  Where's the rationale for entering on either side?  Maybe if we had backed the Germans, they would never had started the death camps.

      I think we need to check the timing of the camps, when the first people were put into them and why.  And when they became death factories.  I think you will see that the worst death camps came about quite late in the war, not in like 1939.

      This is true.  Even when he did it, Hitler had to be very careful to hide their existence from even his own people, who would have revolted.  Any statement that the Allies got involved to stop the Holocaust is pretty far off. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will leave with my favorite view on The War.  The great failure of WWI and success of WWII is the split from nationalistic identity to govermental identity.  WE punished the "German People" for being evil and warmongering in WWI and it got us into a new war.  At the end of WWII, we punished the "Nazi government", didn't crush the economy or humiliate the people, and Germany emerged a healthy nation (eventually).  Japan was an even greater success story. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is key given the horrendous failures we are currently experiencing setting up a healthy government in Iraq.

      It is not so much "have to" as that if someone is trying to murder you, you are not under any obligation to give them the benefit of the doubt.  There is certainly a lack of anti-violence in the world, but if all the pacifists/hesitant are killed who will carry on the idea of peace?   <br/>

      On the "have to" thing, please keep in mind the way the bad guy always pops up again at the last second, or remember the Hatfields and McCoys (or the Balkans).  If you don't make absolutely sure that you've killed the guy who's trying to kill you, he will try again.  If he is dead, his relatives will come after you.  So you have to kill them all if you want peace in our time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
From another perspective, if all killing is bad, then to be good you must be a fructarian and always plant the seeds.

Actually, come to think on it, it depends on where you get your tux from. You might get some nice Disaronno if you shop at Men's Wearhouse but if you get your shit from Big and Tall, at best you will get some retsina. <br/>

Tang by itself isn't the greatest, but when you mix the powder with instant tea powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg, then use it to make a hot beverage, it is delicious.

      yeah... like  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/https://octopuspie.com/">https://octopuspie.com/</a>  for example...  the verbal prose sucks ass...  the story communicated by the character's facial expressions is just as shallow and and formulaic as the prose...  and finally the overall story is basically the same as any standard TV sitcom written by a committee of sell-out writers with no creativity to sell out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But because it's a web comic, all it has to do to compete for the average myspace user's attention is have art that doesn't completely suck, and have each panel be completely free-standing.  While there is ostensibly a story that carries from one panel to the next, you know that the average octopuspie reader's attention span doesn't begin to extend beyond a single panel at a time. <br/>

      Does the MLA really proscribe the italicizing of web comic names? One would think that, as a quasi-book, they should be underlined. I prefer using italics when talking about such as  <em>Achewood</em> , but then again I'm the kind of grammar maverick that puts periods outside of quotation marks.

      Should I use underlining or italics in my manuscript? <br/> 
(https://www.mla.org/style/handbook_faq/mlastyle_underlineitalics) <br/> 
 <br/> 
In preparing scholarly manuscripts, authors commonly italicize text meant to be italicized in the final publication. This practice is assumed in the discussion and examples in the third edition of the MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing. In manuscripts that will be submitted for production by editors, typesetters, and the like, the clarity of every detail of the text is important. Choose a type font in which the italic style contrasts clearly with the regular style. Although some authors, for the sake of clarity, choose to underline words meant to be italicized in publication, this practice is less common than it once was; check with your editor if you would like to format your manuscript in this way. <br/>

      I think I might need a thorough lobotomy for this, but I actually agree with glyc. I started out liking Octopus Pie, but at this point it's joined the trifecta of Comics I Hate For Reasons Mentioned On The Previous Strip. It is the least offensive, but also the saddest in a way because whereas QC is so intentionally lame and one-liner-ish that you get the sense it  <em>knows</em>  it's unfunny, but Octopus Pie seems to genuinely believe that cliched overdramatizations of mundane events are hilarious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So with that in mind, I could only say that I hope to Cthulhu that Onstad does not put in THAT kind of female characterization. And why get on the dude's case when it's clear he writes in his own inner voices? I sure as hell would never try to write a woman - I'm aware of how steeped in my own gender experience I am, and besides real women are like, scary, man. And better no female characters than the vapid and shallow kind that so many webcomics throw in just so they can have yet another romance storyline. I guess it would be cool if we got weird, quirky female characters not solely for romantic purposes (like Ultra Peanut perhaps) but again, I'm not sure Onstad can write them, and that's fine, cause that's okay.

      I can remember really liking Octopus Pie a LOT when I first discovered it, but after only a few weeks I did a 180.  Maybe that just goes to show how unstable I am.  I will put it this way.  OP has elements of greatness.  The facial expressions and body langauge of the characters is really alive and really speaks to me, in the same way I might get a crush on someone in real life because of his/her extraordinary facial expressions and body language.  It could be a Gomer Pyle type thing, a Jim Carrey type thing,  a Richard Pryor type thing.  Sorry I am just naming male examples of people who seize your attention in an endearing way.  No female examples come to mind immediately, but by all means, females are way better at it than men, and with females, at least for me, you're of course not talking about a man-crush kind of thing, but a crush usually with a sexual component too, so that's why I say females are all the better at it - for me anyway they register much more strongly.  Who was it on here who said they had a crush on Mallory of Family Ties?  For me it was that girl on Who's The Boss.  And countless other examples.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
So yeah, there is something attractive and/or endearing about animated and exaggerated facial expressions and body language.  Octopus Pie captures that.  But  but somehow, the final package, when it's all put together, has something I just don't like.  And ya know, I have the same problem in real life - I'll get a crush on someone like Hanna or Eve or a man crush on some guy, but then I realize after a while that hey, there is a disconnect between how interesting this person appears and behaves, and how interesting this person actually is...  also between how interested this person appears to be in me, just as a person, as a casual acquaintance, and how interested this person actually is.  And some people are just really good at creating that illusion of being interesting to you and/or interested in you.  I've known some people who are so good at it that I would classify them as con artists, and the best con artists believe their own lies - the best con artists are fully psychopathic.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And to segeway into a different topic, the most effective con artistry of this sort seems to often mix gender identity into the person's extraordinary and animated and extroverted display of self. <br/> 
 <br/> 
so is Octopus Pie really a cliched overdramatization as you say, or is it that the gender experience that we are all, male or female, steeped in, is, at least half the time, it's self a cliched overdramatization, and OP is merely engaging that part of our culture, and by intrinsic extenstion, ourselves?  Yes, ideally I would not have cliched stereotype be a part of my gender identity, but honestly, how can I escape it when it's all around me?  Intellectually I know that it's cliche and pathetic and that it's time for our culture to move past it, but functionally, this culture is still my mirror, my every interaction with every person of this culture telling me who I am, many times a day.  If I lived in a punk hippie commune I could put up a good fight against pop culture, but sadly, I don't, and I can't.  Maybe the best and most liberating thing that could happen to me would be a massive LSD overdose. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I was just visiting Norway for a little over a week, and it's interesting, I repeatedly ran into a sort of self-awareness in the culture, indeed, several times people told me straight out, that in Norway, as of late, in some respects, the women have become more men than the men. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My friend told me that maybe a decade ago, they had some exchange students from the States, and they were driving somewhere in some shitty weather, two Norwegian chicks and two American guys, and one of the guys commented 'now this is something you'd never see in the sates - we're driving in the middle of a snow storm and the two chicks are in front and the guys are in the back.'   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Really, it's hard for me to nail down more concrete examples, especially since I was only there for a week, but the sense I got of it, and what was directly related to me by Norwegians themselves on this topic, was that over the past several years, that has just been an erosion of some sort of gender roles in Norway.  I mean, I'm sure it's by no means complete, especially not in the West of Norway which is predominately Christian, much to the consternation of much of the rest of the country, but relatively speaking, it is apparently changing.  Identity wise, there is less and less of a distinction between the roles and identities of males and females in Norway.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just off the top of my head, I can think of two things that might facilitate this.  One, as related to me by Norwegians, Norway is much less of a classist society than other countries, especially the West.  Wealth is distributed more evenly, and people don't seem to care how much money anyone has.  There isn't a sort of competition between the classes as such.  Secondly, it's a country of 5 million people.  It's therefore a smaller economy, than say, the U.S.  It's therefore, I think, much less stratified into target marketing groups.  It is target marketing that brings us boring, bland, generic, stereotyped, classed, and gendered content such as we have in the U.S.  That shit makes more money than more human content, because that shit can be more easily matched to target audiences, quantified, and sold to advertisers.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the end of the day, the artisanal culture is more likely to develop a balanced and functional gender identity and gender roles, as opposed to the mass-produced culture where our economic systems rely on and indirectly promote the more easily quantified and hetrogenious and stratified target groups.  In the U.S., we're all numbers, trying to find our inner voices that have been stolen from us, one radio station at a time.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's what's so nice about Achewood, I guess, is that the writing isn't targeted to any specific demographic...  Does market research determine which non-sequitur references get used in Family guy, the same way that market research and strategy determines which kinds of and which specific songs get played on which radio stations?  Well let me put it to you this way...  It would be a breach of fiduciary duty for any publicly held enterprise that maintains a brand such as a radio station or a TV show to not do market research and to not target a specific demographic.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
anyway.  sorry for the long post.

      Meanwhile AchilElbz - what makes you think you can't write females?  Are dudes and femmes so different? <br/> 
 <br/> 
All the same shit you deal with, they deal with too.  Maybe instead of thinking so much about "I'll write what a female will do in this situation", just think about "what would this personality that I developed for a character do in this situation", gender-regardless.  Chicks have personalities that transcend their genders, and men and women aren't polar opposites, you know.

      This is true, and plenty of men have written from women's perspectives successfully. But I would also point out that it is harder for a man to understand a woman's perspective than it is for a woman to understand a man's perspective, because (as you say below) the majority of stories in literature, music, film, etc., are about men. Women are taught about male experience wherever we go, but men are rarely taught about female experience. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was thinking about this recently, because I was wondering if I could write from the perspective of a gay character. I consume a fair amount of books and music by and about gays, and my best friend is a lesbian, but I still don't think I could really understand what it is like to be gay in this society. I could write a dude being attracted to a dude, no problem, but I couldn't write how it feels to be constantly reminded that your sexuality is unacceptable. I would not even  <em>attempt</em>  to write a story from the perspective of a black person. I am well aware that my white privilege would fuck it up big time. However, I do think I could write gay or black or whatever secondary characters, which is all Onstad has to do with Molly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In short: You are absolutely right, I just wanted to point out some nuances.

      So, by that logic, I can therefore only ever write main characters that are Anglo-Celtic/Germanic, lower-middle/upper-working-class, heterosexual fully-bodily-abled Australian/Americans?  Because the subtle nuances of other people are  <em>far</em>  too hard to understand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But more to the point, you are being hypocritical - by saying that you can't write from the perspective of someone of a different culture to your own (in this case: gay, Black American, whatever),  <strong>you are therefore assuming that your character would have to be representative and speak for all members of that community</strong> , as opposed to just being AN INTERESTING CHARACTER BY THEMSELVES.  That's essentially saying that if you're black, your black heritage is going to be the main - if only - thing you think about.  They can't just be an example of a character who goes through the same shit as other people, maybe with a cultural spin which you can ask friends in the culture about, but who happens to be from whatever culture or sub-culture you chose them to be from in order for them to not be "Typical White Guy". <br/> 
 <br/> 
This thinking perpetuates the original problem of stereotyping non-White-Guy characters, and denies the writer of some of the fundamental elements of good character writing: Research, Understanding, Empathy, Grace, Imagination, and Social Questioning.

      I agree with you to a point, but I think you are underestimating the impact of being a member of a disempowered social group. I do not at all think that writing from the perspective of a black character would entail that character only thinking about his/her black heritage. But I also know there are a hundred thousand very subtle things that black people notice about race every second that I never notice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I spend a lot of time hanging out on liberal/feminist/anti-racist blogs, and consequently I spend a lot of time reading about examples of racism, sexism, etc. When it comes to the more subtle examples of racism, I find that all too often I would never have recognized them as racist without having it explained to me. Similarly, I often find that I have to explain why certain things are sexist to men, because they don't notice them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My gender is not at all the only aspect of my personality, but my world is absolutely  <em>inundated</em>  with messages that my gender is inferior. It is utterly inescapable and utterly exhausting, and most men don't even notice more than 10% of it. When you are going through your regular day, you are not inundated with any messages about being Anglo-Celtic/Germanic. So, yeah, I'm sure you could write from the point of view of someone with French or Slavic heritage, no problem. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I'm sure you could write an  <em>interesting</em>  black/female/gay/whatever character off the top of your head, but it seems likely that you would miss a lot of the subtleties, and that black/female/gay/whatever readers would notice that, even if white/male/straight readers wouldn't. In most cases, characters should be realistic in addition to being interesting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, as I said above, plenty of people have written successfully from the perspective of someone not of their race, gender, etc. It probably entailed a lot of research, and it was probably exponentially harder to achieve, but it is certainly not impossible. All I know is, I can't think of a single male acquaintance or friend that I would trust to write a first-person narrative from the point of view of a woman. I've seen it attempted by guys I know before, and it has never worked.

      Have you considered that they're just not that good at writing characters? Men have lots of gender stereotypes and defined roles. If you write a man doing normal things in a flat kind of way, then he's just being a man. If you write a woman in that way, suddenly you are tipped off to the lack of depth by the abnormal gender. To hide that kind of thing you can probably have them talk about feelings a lot and second guess meaning, especially in relation to other people's feelings and their position in hierarchies.

      Basically, after all this (and the posts below), you agreed with what I said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unless I didn't explain things right - in which case, you said what I  <em>wanted</em>  to say.  I was going to go on a tangent about stuff and reference the feminist and anti-racist blogs  <em>I</em>  read (my mother was/is a feminist, and I married one, but it's kind of hard to classify as a "feminist" when you're male - people misunderstand a fair bit), but it was kind of pointless when I read everything you wrote, because you pretty much reiterated everything I said in different wording, whilst claiming to be "disagreeing" with it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ah, sweet sweet semantic arguments. <br/> <br/> <br/> However - I would disagree with you on a couple of points: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. If you are implying that a halfway decent male author cannot do a female narrator well by pure virtue of his genetics and not because of the primarily misogynistic culture that he was raised in, I would disagree.  That shit's all cultural training, yo. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. Missing a lot of subtleties of a particular culture/sub-culture/gender/minority when using someone from that group as a narrator, despite doing arduous research, editing it with and running it by people from that people group (which, as I mentioned, is one of the basic tenets of good writing) - this would be a problem, but it would only be a  <em>massive</em>  problem if I'm attempting to capture the essence of living as part of this people group; if I'm trying to speak for all from this people group.  If I'm writing a main character, and decide that they should be of this people group and have this background as a (small or large) part of the story, and decide to throw myself into learning about this group, that's great.  But it will always be a story about an  <strong>individual</strong> .  True, for me to be the voice of everyone of a people group I'm not actually  <em>in</em>  is to be a bit proud - but that's not what I'm talking about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To deny the writer the ability to write anything besides, essentially, autobiographies, is to be  <em>extremely</em>  short-sighted and unartistic.  A good writer should be gracious and careful, but still be able to show diversity and research. <br/> <br/> <br/> Personal example: <br/> 
As has been spoken of on a previous strip - I have AD(H)D.  This makes me, very very much, an outcast.  It's hard to explain to a neuro-baseline, but the world is not geared for me.  School, work, socialising - these things are just hard enough to be nearly impossible, but we can pass off as 'normal' just enough for people to think "what the fuck is wrong with you?  Why can't you just... <em>do</em>  X thing that everyone else can?" <br/> 
(The fact that you're probably disagreeing that this is as serious an issue as I'm making it out to be further reiterates my point.  I won't go into the complexities of how it affects my life, positively and negatively, right now.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
But would I have a problem with a neuro-baseline author making an AD(H)D-spectrum main character? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hell no - if they did it well.  They won't get it all, of course, but it would be awesome to just be fucking  <em>represented</em>  for once.  Maybe it'll help people understand what I go through - it won't be a  <em>perfect</em>  example, and it won't be  <em>my</em>  specific experience, but hell, it'd be a start.  We get enough negative press as it is, it'd be nice to have positive press. <br/>

      Okay, here is where you and I diverge slightly. I don't think you would be 'inundated' with messages of your gender being inferior if you weren't trained to pick them up. So can you really say that these subtle examples of sexism 'exist' in society the way that a tree exists or the government exists? If social reality is largely a matter of interpretation and if, for instance, a particular event that you feel is sexist does not exist as sexist intent in the mind of the perpetrator, can it objectively be said to be sexism? Furthermore, is the purported victim always automatically correct in asserting racism/sexism, or is it possible for them to be mistaken? <br/> 
 <br/> 
The point is that a woman not steeped in feminism, or a racial minority living in a fairly diverse and progressive region might NOT feel sexism/racism to be a big part of their life. And now that I think of it, it's possible that a white guy could write such a black guy with little problem. But I do think gender is a much larger difference than race (especially since it has a biological basis and isn't just cosmetic), and will inevitably condition a person's experience regardless of whether they feel oppressed or not. So my reply to the good doctor is, again, try to imagine something like Portnoy's Complaint rewritten from a female perspective. Neither his difficulty getting laid in his youth, nor the massive guilt complexes and perversions he experiences later would be believable in a woman, unless you completely changed the story to give different reasons and explanations for them. This would have nothing to do with trying to present your character as an "archetypal woman" - female characters have just as many individual possibilities, but those possibilities rest on a different foundation.

      Let me clarify quickly, and then you may not diverge: I maintain that every woman is inundated with and affected by messages about the inferiority of her gender. Those of us who have been trained to notice them do so, and feel angry and sad and hopeless. Those who have not been trained to notice them just take them deeply to heart and incorporate them into their personalities and gender expressions, which may prove your point even more.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Example: Whether or not a woman acknowledges how or why she knows it, every single woman knows that it is socially unacceptable to be fat for both genders, but more so for women. It is also socially unacceptable to be ugly for both genders, but more so for women. That's why virtually every woman in Western society has fucked up body image issues, and I imagine it would be difficult for a man to understand the  <em>constant</em>  litany of insecurities about personal appearance running through almost every woman's head without living with it 24/7 for years and years like we do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, of course, the best novel I've read on female body image issues was  <em>She's Come Undone</em> , which is by a man. So obviously it can be done, and it's a testament to Wally Lamb's talent and hard work that he did it so successfully. But you really do need to have talent and hard work to pull that shit off. It is not something any halfway decent author can do just by writing a female narrator the exact same way they'd write a male narrator.

      I think any story written with extreme attention to its character's gender is probably not going to be one I'd like to read. Seeing them interact with each other or an interesting concept we can all relate to - death, purpose, etc - that's far more interesting than "What it's like to be a _____." Because, naturally, one person's experience cannot ever be representative of an entire, specific cross-section, but can to an extent be extrapolated to reference the human experience as a whole.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I agree that perhaps gender (or any other arbitrary characteristic) can govern some of the characters' interactions, but I've never felt it to be that much of a hindrance in writing. I've known interesting people and their viewpoints and approaches to life usually interests me much more than what they do with their plumbing, and I just assume it's the same for writing.

      But it seems like you're narrowing 'gender' to 'biological sex'. The thing is that almost every story relies on its characters' gender in an indirect way, as in that the character and situation would be completely different if the gender was changed. For any novels set before 1950, that's basically a given because your gender determined your status in society and such. Afterwards it's a little more subtle, but still there. Could you imagine Charles Bukowski or Brett Easton Ellis stories from a female perspective? Maybe those are cherry-picked examples, but in general, if any story deals with romance (or the lack thereof), the result would be ridiculous if you just reversed the genders. Your viewpoint and approach to life are both directly and indirectly reliant on your gender.

      I am totally with you with the lack of female character depth in Achewood.*  Ever since getting more heartily into feminism via the marvellous  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000328/https://girl-wonder.org/girlsreadcomics/">Girls Read Comics (And They're Pissed!)</a> , I can't help but notice these things all the damn time - which is a good thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The stereotype of Molly being the only female character, and being the one and only love interest for a main character, thus filling the role of "The Chick" - is a black mark on an otherwise great comic.  It perpetuates the archetype of the female character whose only actual character attributes are that "she's female". <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously - if I were an alien trying to get figures of the demographic of the Earth population, and I were going only by movies, television and comics - I would be sure that women make up 20-30% of the population, at most. <br/> <br/> <br/> *Bite my ass.

      I love Christopher Hitchens so much, my heart just melts at the sight of his broken capillaries and disheveled hair.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I've often posited that a lot of women just aren't that funny, but part of me thinks that maybe I just don't have the same sense of humor as most other ladies?  I mean, it is fairly subjective, who am I to say Kathy Griffin is terrible?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, a lot little girls aren't exactly raised with the allowance of some rudeness and crudeness for the sake of humor.  A lot is still held-over, girls are to be demure, soft-spoken, and naive; more the butt of the joke (bikini girls) rather than the jokemaker (Benny Hill). <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, I don't think its so much women are just not able to be funny biologically, as much as it is that being funny isn't a trait really valued in women for most people.   <br/> 
Most men would be okay dating a girl who wasn't funny, as long as she was nice and had sweet cans.  It's just not that important to a lot of ladies, not like 'general kindness' and 'empathy towards animals'.

      Yea, but that's because most men are dumb pricks. (Sexism is fun in both directions!) I would date a woman who wasn't funny only long enough to alleviate my extreme desperation, and even then I'd have a hard time putting up with them.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think what you say about social influence is somewhat true. But the amount of funny women I could name off the top of my head still makes Hitchens look like a dumbass in this case. And actually, Sarah Silverman is funny precisely because of these social expectations, because the incongruity of seeing a nice Jewish girl saying the raunchiest things with a naive and innocent demeanor is much funnier than the predictability of a guy saying the same things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kathy Griffin is pretty terrible though.

      Well um, isn't that true for most people? I don't think the average man is that funny either, since as far as I know the general population consists of barely functioning fucktards. If you're just basing this on your guy friends, then that's selection bias, since you'd tend to hang out with people you find funny and as a guy you're much more likely to be friends with guys in the first place. Just a theory.

      That second Octopus Pie link is a bit iffy. The Decemberists are a great band who's fans are usually seen as pretentious literary snobs. Dan Brown is a crappy bullshit author who's fans are usually seen as airhead idiots who don't like real books. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do not understand what is going on with that character or why the other character is apalled? <br/>

Other than that one strip, this seems a fun webcomic and I shall read some more of it.

      Well, as I interpreted it, with the Dan Brown Book and the band tee-shirt and the Livestrong band and the Yankees bag, she was just being so frustratingly HIP. I don't know exactly when that particular strip was written, but I think two or three years ago, those were some of "the trends". Except I'm not sure about the Yankees bag?

      Nah, Dan Brown was never hip. And The Decemberists are way too geeky to be hip, and if it were over three years ago, really (in the grand scheme of things) pretty obscure.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But then also, I am in England so maybe I am wrong. But as it is, that strip just does not work. "Agh! A person expressing an interest in a wide variety of things of differing quality! Aagh!". ??

      Choose your death: The cold vacuum of space or the cold vaccum of marriage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Deep sea exploration is like marriage too. You have a thousand tons of outside pressure pushing down on your little vessel, and if the weakest point gives in to the pressure, the entire craft usually collapses and dies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So it's best to stay on Terra Firma, niether going too far up nor too far down.

      They both come from the identical Midieval Latin word,  <em>discretus</em> , and have the sense of that word, to discern, to see separately, to distinguish from, which is what you do when you are discreet in behavior, or if you have a discrete variable.  Okay, it's a stretch, but I enjoyed looking them up, and plan to continue mixing them up.

      Well, if it was that bad I just realized a way to redeem myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Last night I was walking around Houston aimlessly when I overheard a conversation about the Godfather trilogy. Four guys were yelling at one guy who said that Godfather III was the best  <em>by far</em> .  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am normally not one to interact with people I don't know -- I'll only argue with you if I like you.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I walked past them, stepped into their circle of argument (because for some reason human instinct tells us to form a geometric shape with no verticies when we have qualms with one another) and told the stupid guy that his opinions were as valuable as Sofia Coppola's acting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The fucking asshole didn't even know who she was. <br/> <br/> <br/> You know what? That didn;t redeem me at all I just wanted to say it because it pissed me off so fucking much.

      It wasn't that bad, but I couldn't pass up the metaphor.  I just can't imagine the life one has to experience in order to call Godfather III the best of them.  What are you inside if you think that?  Do inedible objects look like food, but you don't eat them only because trial and error have taught you they lead to GI distress?  Does the sky appear brownish and unpleasant and you just can't. believe. people. when they say blue is their favorite color?  I would still be pissed off about it.

      To be fair, DeNiro does fall in love with that spaghetti chef with the handlebar mustache who wants to become an insurance claims adjuster and there is that forty-five minute segment where he waits outside while the guy takes the test and DeNiro tries to remember out loud what he ate over the last three weeks.  That was pretty boring italian and gay.

      I like the version where all the crap is edited out and the three are condensed to one movie, but even then, it was too long and boring.  There's basically about five good scenes in all Godfatherland, and a few good lines.  The reset is incredibly, suckingly dull, and Diane Keaton looks like she stumbled into the wrong set, oh, I'll stop now.
