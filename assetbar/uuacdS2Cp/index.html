      In the model of political power in question, the 'right' was for people who did not believe in representation.  Monarchy. Oligarchy.  Theocracy.   <br/> 
Hitler was a Fascist, which is pretty much the edge of the right wing scale.  One man, one rule.  That's right wing.  They called the party socialist, sure, but certainly that was not the way they ruled the country.  They shut down the representative body of Germany.  Burnt the building down if I remember right.  Stalin also has this duality.  His rhetoric was left, but his actions and rule were solidly to the right.  The most left leaning government would technically be communism, but that has never existed.  Currently, the most left governments are in Scandinavia.  Your most right wing right now is probably Kim Jong Il in North Korea...despite the socialist name. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, as srikamaraja noted above, this parliamentary model doesn't work as well today, but for WWII this is what was used.  Find an American Goverment book from as late as the 80s and you'll see what I'm talking about.

      Thank you Avatar, this is indeed the case.  I never passed judgement on good and evil.  I never said the left is good.  This is just the political scale that has been used for a very long time.  To adress your argument elsewhere as well tekende, Stalin was not on the left, despite his claim to being communist.  Stalinism was way right on the political scale too. <br/> 
Representative Democracy (i.e. what we have here in the US) is just slightly left of center on the scale.  And for the record, that suits me fine.  My personal opinion is that extremes to both the right and left are not good things.

      Fascism = right-wing isn't even a controversial labeling. Everyone studying or discussing politics--including, as far as I know, right-wingers--considers fascism to be a right-wing extremist movement. I say this is a libertarian type with more sympathy for the right than the left. As history observes, maybe the label isn't perfect, but it's not some damnable slur on the American conservative movement to call Nazis right-wing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Socialist thing in the party name was a trendy label at the time, and it had nothing to do with their actual government. This is widely acknowledged. Also, it made possible the contraction "Nazi," and you'd be hard-pressed to find a more badass nickname for a bunch of crazy racist murderers than that.

      I find fascism to have more in common with left-wing politics than right. Yes, there's the nationalism and militarism that are more traditionally associated with the right, but fascism hinges on state control of the economy, which is much more of a left-wing thing than right-wing.

      This is a good point.  Socialism has only been put into practice on a small scale in a very limited set of cultural and economic variables.  For instance, does anyone actually think it would work in a country as geographically large and as diverse as the US?  How about a country like Canada?

      The cultural and economic diversity may prevent socialism from being implemented because of political reasons, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't work.  But would it actually work?  Well, it might not work, no pun intended, but it would still be cheaper than the system we got going on now.  In the long run, it's the only way to break an entire segment out of poverty... what... do we think the entire lower class is going to spontaneously innovate and capitalize it's way out of the distinct consumption patterns and social patterns of poverty?  Yet, this is exactly the idea of right-wing economic politics. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The U.S. economic and political landscape is what, the most active and prosperous free markets in the world, and that's not a good thing.  The right wing politics is rooted in fanatical ideology.  Left wing political ideology is too, but to a lesser extent.  That's why left wing politics is always at a competitive disadvantage.  It's easy to argue against fanaticism when your arguments are themselves extremist and fanatical, especially if the population is ignorant and superstitious and uneducated.  It's quite another thing to true to use objective and logical and scientific reasoning against extremist ideas.  It's an apples to oranges situation.  It's like trying to fight a fire with confetti. <br/>

      indeed.  Take Norway for instance.  Ostensibly Christianity is the official religion of the state, yet, it's hella more secular of a country in it's policies and attitudes than, say, the U.S., which is ostensibly a secular country, but which elects nut cases like Bush and Palin to offices, who in turn co-mingle government and church policy as much as they can get away with.

      I think he's a human.  His assistant Randi looks human in the strip two installments ago, so the general vibe I get is he's in human world.  I haven't been keeping up in the blogs, but in the strip, I haven't seen much mention of any distinction between the above/below ground in the longest time.  It seems like the two might have sort of merged.

      As the longtime publisher of  <em>The Onion</em> news-paper, it is my duty and unrestrained pleasure to inform you spittle-soaked readers that I have sold The Onion and all of its various holdings to a syndicate of industrious China-men from the deepest heart of the Orient. One of their representatives oozed and crawled from his dank hut to visit me in person at my bedside last week, and make known his superiors' desire to expand their clammy clutch into the Western world. After subjecting me to a good 20 minutes of infernal bowing and other assorted chinky-dinkery, he offered to pay me what I've been assured is an appropriately absurd parcel of riches to take this tiresome publication off my feeble hands for good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Naturally, I accepted his heathen bargain without the slightest twinge of regret, and why on earth not? When my ancestor Friedrich Siegfried Zweibel founded The Mercantile-Onion in 1756, he did so with the express purpose of fleecing its porridge-brained readers out of as much precious capital as could be wrung from their grubby, desperately toiling fingers, and I say bully and bully again to that. I may be a news-paper-man through and through, but I still have enough sense in my 141-year-old skull to abandon some silly centuries-old loyalty to the periodical page when there are spacious coffers to be stocked. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, how heavenly it shall be to never again hear the ungodly shriek of a printing press, or breathe the insufferable stench of a news-room full of unwashed scribes churning out mindless pap on the subject of photo-play actresses and their adopted African brood. And as far as the whimpering clods who have the temerity to call themselves "readers" are concerned, I do not suppose I shall miss their ilk in the slightest. Why, just imagining their pallid, toothless faces fills me with such colossal rage that at this very moment my nurse-maid is administering to me a near-lethal dose of laudanum just so I may find the composure to reach the end of this missive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Any-way, I wish you all the best of luck making sense of the dis-jointed drivel contained in this inaugural issue of the Chinese Onion. If the new owner-ship does not suck the very blood from your veins, they'll surely dizzy you into stupefied obedience with their unnatural black Orient arts. Oh, and in accordance with the contractual terms of the buy-out, let me remind you all that Yu Wan Mei Fish Time is the best Fish Time, perfect eating for you and me and so delicious. That is all

I'm also thinking that maybe Williams wised up to the ruse after he saw the cook book manuscript.. maybe getting Tedor to throw the contest is a sort of spy vs. spy ruse...  Maybe even provoking Tedor's pride is part of the counter-ruse.?

      if Onstad is to be believed, as he recounts it in interviews, he doesn't ever seem to say he pushes himself, does he?  He did say he pushes himself with regards to trying to avoid discontinuity, saying that character X hates bananas and then having him masturbate with a banana a year later, sort of thing.  Otherwise, Onstad has always described the process as one of just kinda letting the characters take the strip where they may, never planning into the future, just writing it strip by strip.  Obviously, this approach is going to produce a number of duds and disappointments, but I really like this approach, of allowing the characters to be as alive as possible, this approach of sort of not 'simulating' or approximating the characters in his mind, but actually 'emulating' them as accurately as possible, because it results in a strip that is alive and has a life of it's own, which in the long run, has potential to produce stuff that couldn't be produced if each arc was planned too far in advance.

      I recall an interview where he said something to the effect that he spends nine hours on a strip, three in writing alone, and he keeps a long backlog of unused strip ideas. It's clear just from the style of Achewood that he lets the characters speak for themselves, and lets the story go in unexpected directions, but it's silly to extrapolate from that that he doesn't plan his arcs at all. It seems to me that, going into the Wales arc, Onstad thought he would get out more quickly, and he thought he'd have something more interesting to do while he was there. And it was painful to see him flounder, partly because it felt like it must have been painful for him to write in that position. And here he is, back in form, and that makes me glad. <br/>

      So I guess the idea behind an effective tampon commercial is that you have to communicate the idea that the tampon is guaranteed not to fall out of your cooter no matter how you twist your legs about and gyrate your hips, without actually  <em>saying</em>  this, because, it's taboo to talk about cooters and foreign objects being inserted into them. <br/>

      If you do something long enough, even something that you don%u2019t like, that you might even hate, you could begin to do it well enough to make everyone else think you love it. You could even fool yourself if you%u2019re not careful, I know. I%u2019m very good at fooling myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I was around sixteen I decided that I was going to become a great concert violinist. See, I was given the violin at the age of five as a present for taking castor oil and I made the best of a bad situation but at sixteen I decided that I was going to really try. Take four or five lessons a week, practice seven or eight hours a day from this tremendous teacher who had just come over from Germany. I say %u201CI decided%u201D. That%u2019s a lie. Roger decided... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe you know someone like Rog? I use to think he was the greatest thing that had happened to the piano since Walter Bezinking. He wasn%u2019t but I thought so. But there was one thing about him, a tragic character flaw. Something in his smile. <br/> 
 <br/> 
His teeth... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I told him about it. He didn%u2019t know what to say. Oh, he had a game, by the way, that he played with me. He had me go to the piano and strike a chord. And then with his back turned on the other side of the room he%u2019d name all the notes. I%u2019d start with simple chords like a C chord or an F chord, and then I%u2019d get a distended eleventh chord or an augmented seventh or <br/> 
 <br/> 
a perverted twenty-seventh ... Still he%u2019d name all the notes until I wanted to lean on the piano. He had me on my bloody knees in front of his superiority.And I hated him for having absolute pitch... <br/> 
 <br/> 
But then, knowing that he%u2019d gone too far, he became kindly.There are certain kinds of kindness that are like fish hooks. He said, %u201CYou know, you could become the Swedish Jascha Heifetz.%u201D I love that kind of talk. It transported me from that living room. I was carried by his flattery to some huge stage, something that would make Carnegie Hall seem tre son tine... <br/> 
 <br/> 
And there, in what was larger than Death Valley, I was playing the closing measures of some impossibly difficult concerto, as if it were nothing at all. Thousands upon thousands of people, listening like so many hushed cabbage heads. As the last few notes sang out with incredible purity and died away... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then there was a silence after, very much like the quiet that must have followed the Gettysburg Address, and then the audience went mad: %u201CBravo! Encore!%u201D and the applause sweeping across the stage and I there bowing in the warmth of the footlights, turning every now and then toward Roger, who accompanied me, just to let a little bit of the applause glance off to show him that I could be magnanimous with power. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then after a half hour of this %u201CBravo!%u201D and %u201CEncore!%u201D I broke my rule against playing encores which I made at the age of eight and played %u201CThe Old Folks at Home%u201D just to make my mother happy... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I%u2019ll never forget the way it was there in Roger%u2019s living room. I%u2019ll never forget the bay window and the sunshine and the potted fern that his mother loved so well and Roger, the way he slithered past me, past the potted Adder%u2019s tongue that his mother loved so well, through the undulating sunshine with its dust climbing like a Brownian movement towards madness, over to the upright piano. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And as he played his favorite composition there in the twilight %u201CThe Moonlight Sonata%u201D I saw, as if for the first time, his teeth... <br/> 
 <br/> 
And something inside of me sagged. I said, %u201CSee ya%u2019 Rog%u201D and I put my violin in its case, I slammed the front door, I walked the long sidewalk home not stepping on cracks, and I told F. Drucci, cement contractor 1927, "I%u2019m through with music!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've often wondered if F. Drucci, cement contractor 1927 wanted to lay cement sidewalk like -- crazy.

      So, it can't be that hard to get a job in a baby food factory, even if you're just a janitor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Likewise, it can't be that hard to get ahold of a dead fetus.  Worst case scenario, you read the obits and you go dig up a grave.  Although, as you are about to see, the embalming fluid would be a problem.  Probably, then, the next easiest way to get ahold of a dead fetus that hasn't been embalmed yet is from a funeral home.  Worst case scenario, you intercept a hearse on it's way from a hospital.  I'll bet the back door of the hearse isn't even locked, especially in the midwest.  You pull up behind the hearse at a stop light, you toss a smoke or flash grenade as a distraction, pop open the back door, cut the baby casket free from any ropes with your already ready knife, and toss it into your vehicle like a foot ball, and you're off.  Is someone gonna chase you down in a frickin' hearse?  I don't think so.  At the same time as you remove the coffin or plastic supermarket bag as the case may be, toss a smoke grenade into the hearse for good measure.  Wear disposable gloves and a hair net just to be safe, so as to not leave any prints or genetic material behind, and to not get any seepage of dead person fluid on you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Okay, you've got your job at the baby food factory, and you've got you a dead baby fetus.  Now the fun part.  This is where you get to create.  You'll need a cutting board, and a good sharp knife, and some creativity.  You might also need a sewing kit.  And you're gonna need one of those sports drink systems that you wear on your back. <br/> 
[IMGS OFF] Basically, you have to get this dead baby into one of the horse grinders at the baby food factory -- without anyone seeing you, and without drawing attention on the camera system, if they have one.  This will take a little creativity.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cut the baby fetus up into manageable chunks, and puree each chunk in a food grinder.  Dump the baby puree into a large pot until you have the entire baby fetus liquefied in the pot.  Mix in a preservative - the cheapest and easiest to obtain preservative is simply a handful of salt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
pour the puree into the camelbak drink system.  The drinking tube that normally goes in your mouth needs to be extended with some plastic tube from a hardware store and rerouted down the sleeve of your shirt.  (make sure to wear a long sleeve shirt.)  Make sure that you get the version of the Camelbak that has a battery operated pump which pumps the drink for you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Weak the camelbak under your shirt and also wear a fuzzy sweater so the bulk is not so apparent. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now all you do is, during lunch break at your next shift, discretely slip on the modified camelbak 'drink system' in a restroom.  You might be tempted to keep the camelbak in the break-room fridge, but don't do this!  Although you are correct in thinking that the lower temperature will help preserve the baby puree against spoilage, there is the problem that the lower temperature will also change the viscosity of the puree, making it harder to pump for a drink system that is already going to be challenged enough as it is by this thick puree.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now all you have to do is discretely walk up to the horse grinder, lay your hand on the lip of the giant grinding bowl as the horses are dumped in, and with your other hand, activate the camelbak drink system.  It will quickly void it's self of it's contents, pumping the puree out the tube which terminates under the palm of your hand, mixing in with the horse puree. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Obviously, if you can get a job nearer to the end of the assembly line, this is ideal.  As the empty baby food jars whizz by, ideally you will be able to simply hold your hand over the processing of jars, and activate the drink system, possibly even filling some of the jars entirely if the line moves slowly enough and/or the drink system is fast enough, and if you move your hand along with the line so as to follow a particular jar for as long as possible.  As the jars proceed under the filler which squirts a pre-measured amount of horse puree into each jar, all that will happen is that the horse puree will overflow from the already full jars, and the jars are subsequently capped by the cap machine.  It's a little messy, but by the time the jars get boxed and to the store, most of the excess puree will simply have fallen off.  Any that is left will be then be dried on and not very noticeable to the end consumer and/or the person stocking the shelves. <br/>

Given an insane leader, communism and facism work out to much the same thing in the end. But, there has never actually been a real communist state in the Marxist sense however-communism being the natural end to a historical process, rather than a power-grab by someone tired of the aristocracy *cough* Lenin *cough*. On a less pedantic note, an elderly man in a cute elephant costume being cross with Teodor is pretty darned cute.

      When I stab myself in the nuts with a sharp twig, it always seems to hurt, but that says nothing about the original Marxian theory of nut-stabbing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nut-stabbing is the natural end to a historical process. You just need to do it properly. That's what I tell myself anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, AIU, if you want to post more... oh somebody else said it already.

      It was a journey on an endless lake of frustration. I turned my mind inside out, rinsed it, and put it back in place. I went through seven rings of hell and came back. And then I got it. The enlightenment came instantaneously. One moment I understood nothing, and the next moment everything clicked into place. ... I've achieved an almost divine state of mind, an instantaneous enlightenment experience that turned my view of Twitter on its head in less than a single second.
