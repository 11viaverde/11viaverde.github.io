      I used to think that when your dreams started to get more vivid than your life, it meant you were going nuts.  Now I'm just convinced it means your brain is trying to tell you something really important, almost invariably about yourself.  Only you can know what this is though.  Sharing your dreams with your friends is ultimately pointless, though it can be a fun way of annoying your friends.

      I've noticed that any time someone makes a "CHING CHONG WING WONG" reference, it gets lamed out of existence - most likely by people who missed that strip and think the comment is racist. Maybe MC_white is just trying to prevent unnecessary laming.

      More likely it's because every time someone mentions Chinese people, or Chinese culture, or Chinese language, or Chinese restaurants, or China dishware, or porn involving Chinese people, or anything that begins with the letters C-H-I, someone immediately posts CHING CHONG WING WONG like it's this really clever thing they just thought of without any help from anyone else ever.  It was great the first 500 or so times to quote it directly, but by now you should have some sense of awareness in your post that this has been done before.  Falseprophet had this in his, and currently has 60 chubbies to 5 lames.  mc_white's post did not have this, and currently has 4 chubbies to 44 lames.  The people have spoken: use CHING CHONG WING WONG responsibly.

      It's also based on a mistranslation of something Ahmedinejad once said: He said that homosexuality isn't thing in Iran, meaning that you can't "be gay" there in the western sense (at least in the eyes of others), you have to be a dude who likes bumsex with other dudes.* This is the only reasonable translation of what he said, because he knows how many people have been hanged for mansex. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is unnecessary to post the number of gay dudes who do not like bumsex, or to point out that iran murders lesbians as well. Everyone knows these things.

Actually, it's not racist. There are a lot of Chinese people at most casinos. It's not a generalisation, it's a fact. (A generalisation would be "All Chinese people love to gamble and are at casinos constantly.")

      All casinos on the west coast have lots of Chinese people.  It is a verifiable fact.  It is also a deep spiritual connection that I share with the Chinese people, a love of drinking poorly made Rusty Nails while losing money to either the Indians (if in California) or the mob (if in Nevada).

      I am old enough to remember the birth of the Age of Irony.  It actually had nothing to do with the internet and was more of a spontaneous phenomena.  Hipsters are not the fathers of it, more like its offal.  And I mean that in the nicest possible way.  I think irony was born from the ashes of The Cosby Show.  A kid could learn all sorts of shit from that show.

      hey you might want to be careful with yr shades: a friend of mine recently said to me "there's this couple that lives by me, and they're always naked around the house, and one day i saw them in there making bacon and totally getting the shit burned out of them and i was like 'take that, nudists!'" <br/> 
 <br/> 
you don't by any chance live in eugene, oregon, do you? <br/>

      It is perhaps the best thing for a relationship to set aside one day of the week to be naked around the house. <br/>

      Sometimes Teodor just gets naked; he seems to have a bit of a nudist streak in him. Naked jogging in the backyard, naked helping Chris Onstad with the shipments in the wee hours of the morning... <br/>

      I agree on your first sentence, at least.  I can not fully understand why this band is so popular.  I bought their first album not too long after it came out and the hype had begun, and was underwhelmed.  It's good and all, I feel like I should like the songs, but they just don't provoke much response from me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember thinking at the time, "This band probably considers Neutral Milk Hotel to be a big influence."  Maybe I thought they had a relatable emotional and musical "and the kitchen sink, too" approach.  I'd rather listen to NMH.

      I think cat lovers would call how uncooperative they are "character." Dog lovers would call a dog's extreme stupidity "character" in a similar fashion.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would just call it "hilarious", though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When my weiner dog was a lil puppy he tried to walk on a lily pad in my parent's back yard pond. The sight of him peering carefully at the pad, then extending one paw out and taking a confident step which soon turned into him upending and tipping forwards into the pond, is pretty much going to be the highlight of my life. I mean, there's probably going to be some pretty good stuff later, I hope, but nothing's going to match seeing his eyes shoot wide as he did a fully-fledged front flip into the water and then cling to the side of the pond. It's all downhill from there.

      i can totally see him trying. seeing one in some pond and thinking 'LANDING PAAAAD!!' so he aims for it but instead of plopping onto a sturdy piece he just plops into the water. he has to paddle back to shore and let his wings dry in the sun for three hours. it is in this time which he is most vulnerable to attack. <br/>

      My parents have a dog (a dalmatian) who, as a puppy, ran out onto the pool cover with no idea there was water underneath. His frantic tries to step on solid ground as the pool cover slowly sank are also pretty much the highlight of my life. He was so confused that even when he moved his paw over to that  <em>other</em>  part of the pool cover, it  <em>still</em>  wasn't solid. Eventually it sank enough that he could swim over to the side and we hauled him on out.

      Regarding Dogs vs. Cats: The only possible way to raise a cat that prevents it from becoming a total douchebag is up a flagpole by its tail. Do this while they're young and they'll die a partial (albeit cute and fuzzy) douchebag at worst.

      This sounds like a title for teenagers who are a little below the label "young adult." If you want cheesy young adult fiction, I recommend the novels by Stephanie Meyer (New Moon et seq). If you want a classic, the Outsiders is what started it all.

      Are you talking to me? I think you are. I hate assetbar. Let me try to explain. When I first read tsrts's poll, I thought he was asking for people to indicate that they don't read assetbar by laming him (since to me, the natural order of things is chubby = positive = yes; lame = negative = no). My first reply was supposed to imply that he was going to get a lot of "false" lames--i.e. people laming him not because they don't read Assetbar, but because ...  <em>well</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, since I misinterpreted his instructions, that comment no longer made sense, so I thought I should own up to that. I tried to quickly explain that I was confused by what was to me an inversion of the "chubby=yes / lame=no" principle. Further, since up is now down and black is now white, perhaps lawbot, well-known (and beloved?) for his tendency toward strict polarity in his responses might also have trouble. It was a disastrous couple of posts, and I am glad to be rid of it with the conclusion of this, the most boring post in the history of assetbar.

      Ah jeez. I lamed you, but I feel so bad about it. I guess you had to set it up that way, though, or we'd all think it was a cheap ploy to get chubbies and lame you right in the face, and then your poll would be all kinds of messed up.

      I think maybe he knew that. Somewhere deep down in the deep dark shadows of his soul. If so, what is the point of the poll anyway? <br/>

I think he is a dude who wishes for more pain all the time to dull some other pain from History. He is a dude who refuses to believe he is rad. There is nothing we can do for him now.

If you are talking about the artistic quality of the drawing you have a point, I guess. <br/>

But speaking as a math major/computer science minor who has worked in the software industry and currently teaches math in high school, I quite often find myself curled up on the floor, regaining consciousness after having laughed myself into a state of senselessness reading xkcd. <br/>

Just because it doesn't speak to you doesn't automatically mean it is shitty.

      I thought wiener dogs were bred to pull badgers out of holes. <br/>

This is why their tails stick straight out behind.  So the badger hunters have a handle to pull the wiener dog out of the badger hole.

      Not to be too pedantic, but the launches of Laika, Ham, and other animals did provide useful data for the US and Soviet space programs.  They showed that living organisms could survive launch and being in a weightless environment for extended periods, and how their bodies would react.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sadly, though, it's correct that there was not even an intention of trying to return Laika to Earth.  Ham and other space chimps did survive reentry, but Laika died from overheating several hours into the voyage.  The actions of the Soviet space program raised ethical concerns at the time, and there were protests at Soviet embassies.

      I'm not sure how to interpret that. Like, she looks like she would open her mouth and a torrent of boring would come out? If that is what you mean, I agree. Life with her would be basically spent explaining why Monty Python is funny.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, maybe you mean boring-looking as in a perceived lack of vibrant animation makes a woman unattractive.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do not agree with this, because a misshapen woman falling down the stairs is exciting-looking but wholly unattractive.

      If I may interject, Jessica Simpson, to me, is the Labrador of women.  Pretty dog, sure.  No obvious flaws.  When you ask a kid to draw "dog", they'll draw something like that, because it is a very general and pleasant looking breed of dog.  Nothing exotic, no defining features.  When you ask a person to draw "pretty girl", it's going to come out looking a bit like Jessica Simpson.  Big eyes, pouty mouth, classically fertile body.   Blah blah blah. Where's the excitement in a Lab or Jessica Simpson? <br/>

      I agree. If I were to offer an example of what I consider hotness of a more unique order, I suggest Regina Spektor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
[IMGS OFF] <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean look at her. She is a chanteuse, she has mystery, she could be a former prostitute, she could be a virgin, she could play Sofia in the Broadway version of  <em>Crime and Punishment</em> . Depending on your tastes her flaws could be qualities and her qualities flaws, but there is no way you will think her some perfected sculpture for there is no humanity in that, and there is nothing endearing about that. You almost think you have a shot with her and  <em>it's like she wants you to think that too</em> . Does she know she is beautiful? If she doesn't, can I reassure her? She usually has lipstick but she sure as hell doesn't need it. I wish I could temporarily be blind so that I'd have to trace the contours of her face and body with every part of mine. <br/> 
 <br/> 
O Regina! Thou transcendent, naturalist beauty! Read to me the works of Emerson and Thoreau! Sing in your childlike-yet-mature voice of lost love and innocence! Sing into the microphone upon the stage and upon my loins! Sing, sing, o sing! For in this life the only whispers worth hearing are not to be spoken into the ears they are to be spoken directly into naked flesh.

      I chubbied it for you, Regina Spektor is hot.  Another singer I always thought was hot, but not in a normal way, is Fiona Apple.  I think she's the only person I can think of who simultaneously turns me on and terrifies me.  She's crazy hot, and from what I've seen in interviews, she seems pretty cool, but she has that weird vibe where it seems like she might cut you for looking at her wrong.

      She is very hot, and makes very good music, but she is an insane person. I saw her in concert, and she was either on drugs or having some sort of episode. She was crawling around on the floor and talking to herself and picking up the little random pieces of trash she found to closely examine them. At several points, she walked off the stage for no apparent reason, then came back a few minutes later. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In other Fiona-Apple-related anecdotes, a boy once told me I looked exactly like Fiona Apple. It was probably the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. (I look 0% like Fiona Apple.)

      Sorry. All kidding aside, the point I was originally trying to make was simply that catgrl131's response to niggar was very similar to a typical lawbot post. However, I thought that I could add humor to my analysis by appropriating the voice of a cliche martial arts film, in which discussions of different styles and schools are commonplace. When you requested clarification, I again opted for misguided humor instead of a simple straightforward answer, so I posted some images of the Wu Tang Clan as a  <em>clue</em>  that I hoped would get your mind in a martial arts region so that you would go 'Oh I get it now.' As an added bonus, I'd have the opportunity to start up the second White People Music thread on this strip, the first being about The Arcade Fire. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, that's right. I just called nine Brooklyn hardcore rappers White People Music.  <em>Tawlk amawngst yaselves.</em>

It is everything you will ever need. In my youth, we had owned almost all of the single books, but I needed to have this, so in the future I could place it in my wall-sized bookshelf, next to the Expanded Riverside Edition Shakespeare. <br/>

      uh oh people stop having a terrible prejudice against the Soviet space program. We were launching dogs and Americans were launching monkeys (which is worse? I'm just glad no one was launching cats). Plus, Russian/Soviet flight preparations were always more thorough than Americans', which resulted in far fewer casualties (I think the ratio is something like 1 to 2.5) both on land and in the atmosphere, so the dogs didn't die in vain. And no there was no "secret dead cosmonauts" if you believe in this crap then you are no better than Moon landing deniers. I noticed that people these days tend to overestimate the soviet propaganda machine. C'mon that's the same time period when Solzhenitsyn was published! The system was baby-bottom soft those days. In fact, American propaganda turned out to be more effective in the end. Hell, it's still working, people still get alarmed when they see a communist. <br/>
