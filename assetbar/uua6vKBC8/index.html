      <em>French fries have numerous variants, from "thick-cut" to "shoestring", "jojo", "crinkle", "curly" and many other names. They can also be coated with breading and spices, which include garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, paprika and salt to create "seasoned fries", or cut thickly with the skin left on to create potato wedges, or without the skin to create "steak fries", essentially the American equivalent of the British "chip".</em> <br/>

      I'll grant you that; but the idea that a person who specifically limits the variety of foodstuffs they eat therefore eats a wider variety of foodstuffs than  <em>anyone</em>  is pretty obviously unsupported.

      Yeah, it's a spurious argument, epicurus (appropriate username, by the way). But I think it can, paradoxically, turn out to be true for some people. I was a way crazy finicky eater until I went vegetarian. Cutting out the meat-based meals I used to have all the time prompted me to try other types of food I probably would've avoided otherwise. So my palette definitely expanded as a result of cicumscribing the types of food I would eat. I still find it strange when people harp on this idea when trying to extoll the virutes of the veg lifestyle, though.

      That, and the argument, "I got less picky when I limited my means of caloric intake" doesn't mean that there are more options.  It just means you had to make that tough decision between starvation and ingesting collard greens. <br/>

      Pat didn't say there were more  <em>options</em> , though. He said that vegans eat a wider variety of foodstuffs. <br/>

I'm looking at the comic again. Because I am a relatively sane person, I read it as: "the average vegan in the US & Canada eats a wider variety of foodstuffs than the average non-vegan in the US & Canada." But no, he says vegans eat a wider variety of foodstuffs "than anyone." Y'all are right; that's mathematically preposterous. Anyway, I eat all kinds of meat, and I  <em>like</em>  collard greens.

      Acknowledging that this whole discussion took place two years ago and that you are all most likely dead or at least uninterested in achewood and certainly no longer checking your old discussions just to see what developed, I must say a few things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Things like this: man, what a lot of stupid stuff several of you are saying! When people have to be more deliberate about their food, they might well get more interested in it. (It's not causal, Epicurus; it's concomitant.) It's totally plausible that a vegan (having to be a bit more creative for dinner) comes to eat a wider range of things. When I went vegan 10 years ago, my food-world got way more interesting and way bigger.  And no, farqussus, I don't just mean I started eating more beans. I mean tons and tons of different fruits, veggies, grains etc that I could bore the shit out of you by listing, and I totally will at the drop of a hat, so be cool.

      My cousin has Crohn's Disease, and believe me when I tell you that there is  <em>no good way</em>  to work that phrase into any conversation involving a rotting colon.  I've worked long and hard at the problem, and I have concluded that the problem is, if not insoluble, far beyond my means of discovery. <br/>
