Also, update box. I did the whole lucky cigarette thing and all that happened was that it lost a whole bunch of tobacco from the end which went all over everything in my bag. So really not all that lucky, I'd say.

      Rolling your own cigs is heck of cheaper than buying pre-rolled packs. <br/>

Also if you invest in a cigarette rolling machine, you don't get it "all over you".  Plus the money you save on cartons pays for it eventually.

      Hey odei, I got here twelve minutes after you posted your comment. Curr-azy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I love straights. I prefer them so much to roll-ups, and I just plain cannot roll despite trying over one times. But I'm starting university in a few weeks and will be a poor, poor, poor student. So basically I have to learn to roll and accept the fact that I'm going to have to be not smoking straights. Sigh.

The jury is still out when it comes to deciding whether a lucky Lucky Strike actually CURES cancer, or if the two lucky's cancel each other out and gives you Super-Cancer.
