      It would! I asked a geology teacher about the NASA transmissions back and forth when we were studying the moon. He said it might actually work with a better signal, seeing how it's got a more-or-less straight shot to the satellite it needs (provided you have not swung to the other side of the earth yet, I think) to transmit data. Depending on your coverage, you could totally call a dude from the moon.

      Oh dang Laurie, I just don't really care much about your 'ol blue world down there no more. <br/>

If someone were to recast The Watchmen with Achewood characters, Beef actually wouldn't be a bad Dr. Manhattan. Granted after giving the idea another half second's thought he would seem more an appropriate fit as Dan Dreiberg.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is now my sincerest hope that some other people who've read the Watchmen see these comics and contribute to this concept. Right now I'm trying to think if Lyle or Todd would be better as the Comedian.

      Yeah, Lyle is definitely comedian, but I do think Roast Beef would better for Dreiberg. Also, I'd rather see Ray as Rorschach, just to increase the RB/Ray parallels. Also Ray does often enough refuse to give up on his values. Even if his values circle around water having nutrients.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, Phillippe might have to be Doctor Manhattan. Not because it makes any sense at all. Just because it would be awesome. He probably just teleported to Mars for fun. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, obviously Pat is Ozymandias.

      This reminds me of the Myth Busters episode where they try and bust a number of moon landing conspiracies.  One of the conspiracies is that the astronauts' boot prints are too well-defined as they step across the surface, and that the dry lunar dust wouldn't keep a fully-detailed imprint of the bottom of their boot.  In the moon landing videos their foot prints seem as if they're appearing in wet sand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They use a pan full of this dry material with similar properties to lunar dust (the name escapes me), in a NASA vacuum chamber and use a robotic device to make a foot print in the pan with a real boot from a space suit.  Despite the fact that the Earth has stronger gravity than the moon, a difference they couldn't really simulate, the boot makes a perfect imprint that maintains its shape after the boot is removed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In closing, unless disturbed by lunar impacts, that JAVA is going to be around for a while.   <strong>SCIENCE!</strong>
