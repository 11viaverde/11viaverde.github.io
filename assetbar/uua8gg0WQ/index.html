      I retracted a comment I had made teasing Retardo about his crush on Onstad, as I do believe the guy wants to have a (semi)serious discussion about homosexuality and its role in American culture, or somesuch, but honestly Retardo... take the hint that this is not the best forum in which to discuss this.

      It's sort of hilarious, I have never once read a full comment by retardo, but I've seen his name  <em>everywhere.</em>  He's sort of like Morpheus from the first Matrix movie, except not as mysterious and probably not as cool of a dresser and while I bet he can rock a can or two better than Morpheus he probably can't handle the dual-wield machine gun pistol action.

      No, it's not.  Angelina Jolie is a highly exposed actress, and even so, mailing comparable to her would likely get you in trouble with the law.  Onstad is a relatively private author.  The fact that you spam every vaguely gay-related strip with love letters is creepy, and awful, and yes...scary.

      Angelina Jolie is gross. Her body's hot and all but it looks like she got stung on the lips by a hive of bees.  <br/>

      There are guys who understand the concept of the paper bag joke, and yet do not really find it amusing, as they find a woman's face an important part of the whole package.  <br/>

      Upon examining other comments, it appears that you were referencing a movie which I have not seen.  I am sorry I lamed you.  It is only because I thought you were hating on John Wayne for no apparent reason.  Group hug?

      For a while when I read this strip I thought Ray was referring to the actual "man first walks on the moon" moonwalk. His description still kind of fit.

      I don't think I'd ever read an achewood strip and give it anything but "pro", but man I love this particular one as well as the entire thread that follows.  Ray's superpower of turning any new discovery into a money-making scheme is inspiring.

      I used to hang out at this gay bar a lot because I had a lot of gay friends. And they had TVs set up in the bar which sometimes showed music videos but more often than not played gay porn movies. I don't know if the whole genre of gay porn is like that stuff, but it was nasty. Not because it was two dudes doing the huckle buckle, but because the dudes would, like, lick each other's armpit hair and stuff. I was like, who the hell does that? Is this a thing of gay people? Because as much of a crush as I have on Fiona Apple, I would not like to lick her armpit hair.
