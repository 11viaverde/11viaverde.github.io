      It's a reference to Miyamoto Musashi, who was the most badass swordsman in history and invented the technique of using a katana and a shorter sword at the same time (or dual wielding as the kids today call it). He's been depicted in a few animes and games but I think the novel was the most well-known portrayal.

      To the extent expressing a view of the equivalence of the rational or moral value of particular religious regimes (they each have none), as octafish did, helps to show religious people that we think they're dickheads for being religious, rather than for the religion they choose.  Put differently, if a Catholic (picked as a random example) tells me the Scientologists are irrational tools for believing in volcanic space monsters, I agree, but it does not make believing in virgin birth less stupid.

      Not to argue for or against you, but by your same logic, a religious person could argue that the difference between scientific theories of the origin of the universe, is also pointless and equally stupid from their point of view.  This argument goes no where on either side.  Pogo (who is below my comment currently, but who knows where he'll end up) has cut to the heart of the matter.  Humans and all, repeat ALL of their systems of organization and understanding are flawed.  If you believe in science absolutely without questioning it you are no less of a zealot than someone of absolute faith.  It is just a matter of which system of organization you have chosen to make sense of the world.  Who is right, who is wrong?  Not a clue, but I am secure enough in my own beliefs that I don't need to sway others one way or another.

      I'm sorry, I'm sure you mean well, but your argument is so trite and sloppy that I can't leave it unadressed. The fact that all human systems of organization are flawed (and you have to explain exactly how and why that is) doesn't mean that some aren't flawed more than others. And please don't parrot the 'science is just another religion' line. Without even going into a discussion of empiricism and the burden of proof, some 'systems of organization chosen to make sense of the world' have a much higher success rate than others.

      No... please please please go back to basic logic.  I hate that people have to argue about this.  Science is not religion, but EVERYTHING comes down to faith at some point (prove to me that your senses are trustworthy and that so are mine - it's impossible).  Science makes hypotheses and tries to prove them through experiment and data.  Religion is about making sense of the world without becoming a barbarian or prick.  Science has done a lot of good and a lot of bad.  So has religion. So what is the point of arguing? <br/>

      While I won't deny I danced around the idea of 'science is just another religion' it was not my point.  My point was more in the direction of criticizing anyone who believes in a system without questioning it and understanding how it works.  I may have conveyed it poorly, my apologies.   <br/> 
	Explaining how systems are flawed is difficult and I have limited space here due to the fact that I don%u2019t want to write a dissertation on the internet.  I dislike reducing, but I%u2019ll have to do that.  It boils down to this: we, as human beings, are limited by perspective.  We see only what we can see.  We are unable to view things from the objective position, only from the subjective of our individual or collective experiences.  While there may be a system of organization that explains everything in the universe, we would be limited or flawed in our perspective of it because we would only be able to understand those things that could be represented to our current sense and understanding.  We, humans, are the flaw in that we have a very limited means of communicating and interacting with our environment.  That is the great hope of technology, that it will allow us to expand our interaction with everything around us, but we also need a greater means of communicating as well.  Science and religion dovetail in that they have the same goal:  they are designed to answer the question of our origin and our future.  Why are we here?  Why are we like we are?  Have we always been like this and will we always be like this?  The answers to these questions are the ultimate goal.  According to the theory I am describing here, we would be unable to do this because of the flaw in our own perception that makes us always refer new things back to point of references already within our perspective.  Scientists do this constantly through the use of journals.  Science is limited by the need to take the observations of an individual, communicate those observations accurately, and then have the majority of other individuals in the same community accept those observations.  The flaw is not that we cannot see the object, the flaw is in how we interpret the value of the object.  In other words, how we perceive that object.  We could, and probably do, miss the true value of that object because we have to reduce it to our own perspective, or reduce it to something that can be communicated with others instead of being able to view it from the overall objective position. <br/> 
	But wait, is this theory right, thereby proving we can get around this perspective issue?  Probably not; because every now and then a person comes along who has an idea completely out of our present perspective (think Einstein).  Where do those ideas come from?  If we had a system that could solve that, we would know our own origins as thinking beings as well. <br/> 
	As for the success rate of various systems, that is a matter of opinion too, and wholly dependent on your definition of success.  The ancient Greeks were very successful in describing the universe to the satisfaction of the people in their day.  The priests in the middle ages were successful in describing how the world worked to the people in their day.  Scientists are very successful in doing so today.  As a student of history, my perspective is that nothing much has changed in that success rate.     <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lastly, to answer the question of science being a religion: no it is not.  You have sited good reasons why it is not, but there are religions that take a scientific approach (like Christian Science for example).  Instead, I like to think that the critical difference is in its application to day to day life.  This is way oversimplified, but the theories of science are generally not something you choose to abide by or not, whereas religion is (although some folks believe in predestination) a set of theories that you can choose to abide by or not.  In other words, I can choose to demonstrate my belief in God, but I have no choice but to demonstrate my belief in gravity.  There are many grey areas of course, but that%u2019s another discussion.  I sort of picked on science here, but you could re-write the whole thing about religion too.   <br/>

      Most people understand the concept of not knowing whether god exists, but don't understand the reasoning behind it.  I think most people see agnosticism as waiting for information that will enable the agnostic to decide whether or not to believe.  It is difficult to impart the idea of God as an unknowable item on people who believe that God either exists(theists) or doesn't exist(atheists).  I don't think people mean to misuse the term, it's just that the idea doesn't fully reconcile with their thought process, so they use the best definition that they can. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Deism is another fun spiritual/philosophical concept to try to explain to people.  Most religious people, regardless of their religion, have trouble wrapping their head around the concept of a divine power who created the universe, but does not interfere with it.  It's not that they are stupid, it's just that their particular belief structure makes the idea of deism virtually impossible for them to comprehend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, what I was trying to say is that there are certain philosophical/religious/spiritual ideas about the nature of god and the universe that are difficult to explain to anyone who subscribes to a traditional religious or atheistic viewpoint, because the ideas are so far disconnected from their own that they can't fully grasp the concepts.

      I mentioned deism because I have tried, on several occasions, to explain the concept to religious friends and acquaintances, and the idea was totally lost on them.  They were unable to process the idea that I believe in god, an ultimate power in the universe, but I don't believe that such a power has any influence over day to day events.  It is difficult to explain philosophical ideas about god to someone who thinks of god in a solely religious manner.

      I'm not so much trying to save people from anything as trying to save myself from having to hear another uninformed argument about the complete Evil or religion or the complete Evil of Atheism.  It angers me that we as a species are not beyond this sort of thing.

      Okay, I apologise for saying I'm anti-religion, that is in fact a false statement. I am however anti-organised religion. Belief and or faith are very  fine things indeed and I envy those whose belief/faith is a reassuring or guiding influence in their lives. My belief, in the non existence of a divine power or powers, has caused me nothing but angst and despair, but it is what I believe and I can't change that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
  So what I was maintaining in my post was, organised religion is a jip. I can't think of an organised religion that doesn't have a power structure that involves a priest class taking money from the followers. Maybe that represents a failing in education on my part, (I am not a theology student, duh) if someone can supply me with an example contrary to my assertion, that would be great. <br/>

      no offense, but it bothers me when people say things like "Buddhism isn't an organized religion" or "Buddhism isn't really a religion it's more like a philosophy."  <br/>

maybe people are associating it with how it's practiced by young hipsters in the West, but Buddhism is an old, established religion with hierarchy, gods and goddesses, and all that shit.

Clearly this isn't the optimal forum for a discussion of this subject, but the religious have gotten away with belittling and demonizing the non-religious for millenia.  Turnabout is fair play. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for people who advocate not discussing religion, politics, or sex because it's too controversial, fuck that.  That's virtually everything worth discussing, if you add whiskey and music in there.

      But Flazis, to be unconcerned about the discomfort others may feel when sex, politics, or religion comes up (not to forget money) is to be rude and crude.  And the fights that might develop, especially over religion and politics, are not why most people get together.  In other words, the world does not revolve around oneself, and the purpose of talking to other should be as much to listen and learn as to impose and upset.

      OH Man. At the risk of being lamed or ignored I must say that I am a fan of KRLA. That being said I must say I cannot abide Kevin James and prefer to motor in silence when he comes on. I really hope that this is his undoing; there's just way too much deadwood, inanity and screaming on talk radio. Kevin James (and the entire lineup at KFI here in LA) epitomizes all that is wrong with talk radio.

Scientologists sure make  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090905024220/https://www.pancakeparlour.com/">some kickin' pancakes, however.</a>   Shitty websites, though, it would seem.  And hella prices for said pancakes, and the marketing totally needs a makeover. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Naturally, this of course applies to all Scientologists.  Shitty websites and good pancakes are their equivalents of holy texts.

      Darn, I thought "amanuensis" was something dirty.  Turns out it is just Latin for certain persons performing a function by hand, either writing down the words of another or performing manual labour. The term is derived from a Latin expression which may be literally translated as "manual labourer."  The term is often used interchangeably with secretary or scribe. <br/>

Say, there could be other things Nice Pete could do with his hand for Ray.

      I always thought it was Lone Al.  Like some fat kid named Albert who doesn't bath and so yeast pockets form in his fat folds and he smells like fresh bread and nobody talks to him and he has to pay double for hookers and they will never go down on him and he is so fat he can't even masturbate and he has like really back problems with his prostate.  That's how I picture loneal. <br/>

      Possible Response 1: You have just described my exact opposite in every single way. He is probably posting over at that other Achewood forum, hanging out with Asherdan and the gang. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Possible Response 2: This is what you are masturbating to while you cut my hair bit by bit at night. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Possible Response 3: On some websites I go by LoneEel, which is the same pronunciation, but with lots more connotations of aquatic solitude and sadness.

      1) I came from that 'other' mirror forum a few weeks ago, where I am considered the exact opposite of lawbot.  I always say YES. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2) I never said I was masturbating while I cut your hair.  I implied it.  Implied it all over your pillow. <br/>

3) I... I got nothin. <br/>

 <br/> 
*See above conversation about Scarlett Johannsen  <em>I don't care if I spelled it wrong</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
**See also every band that had their slightly creative albums that nobody liked and/or did other stuff that made them happy that didn't involve music, then "came back to their roots" and made hell of money and sold hell of albums in the process, eg. Chilli Peppers, U2,  Linkin Park (wait a few years, this'll happen), Project 86 <br/> 
 <br/> 
***See also how Limp Bizkit finally got Wes Borland on board, who's absence everyone blamed for the fact that they sucked, and then they sucked just as much if not more. <br/> 
 <br/> 
****Their original "3 Dollar Bill Y'all" album was surprisingly good for its time.  This will be okay to admit in like 7 years when everyone's out of their "LOLZ THE 80's YAYZ!!!" phase and has moved onto the 90's.  Nu Metal was fun for a while, I don't care.

      Dude...no. Neither Limp Bizkit nor Korn "used to be good". Their first albums sucked, and their subsequent albums sucked more. The excesses of the 80's have been rehabilitated, but there are some things even ironic nostalgia can't accomplish - making Nu-metal cool again is one of those things.  <br/>

There is a storm of lames gathering over you right now for even mentioning Nu-metal on here. We had all blissfully forgotten that such a thing ever existed.

      The funny thing is that part of the reason Deftones survived from one era into the next is because they also meshed well with the emo/post-hardcore craze, all touring with Poison the Well and Thursday and whatnot.

      A predictable response. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It all depends what you consider Nu-Metal.  From the one time I listened to it, "3 Dollar Bill Y'all$" was genuinely entertaining.  The whole Rap/Rock thing was good for a while.  A short while, I'll grant you, but a while no less. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Until, naturally, it succumbed to the same downfall any form of angry music succumbs to when it gets popular and every motherfucker starts doing it - it gets immature.  The anger and justified passion that was Rage Against The Machine was transmogrified into the "check it out, I've got a penis!  And chicks have boobies! Fuck shit ass cunt and fuck!" that was Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Hot Action Cop and every other bastard that came along.  And even when it remained slightly serious (POD, Machine Head's "Burning Red" album, other stuff), it had still gotten further and further away from metal and further away from rap and was somewhere boringly inbetween. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, that's if we're considering Nu-Metal to be just rap/rock, which it wasn't.  It was, in my mind  <strong>(and I just KNOW this damn argument will come down to semantics and what each person defines as "Nu-Metal")</strong>  basically where metal and hard rock met - it had more singing than metal, and more common and easily accessible pop song structures.  This pissed metal fans off because, let's be honest, they're elitist as all hell.  Nu-Metal also pissed off your average critic because it's basically angry teen music. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I still find it enjoyable, and I think as a genre it always has potential for awesome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps in my head the boundaries between Nu-Metal and Groove Metal blur, as all the awesomeness I'm thinking of could arguably just be considered Groove Metal, and has little of the rap, funk or otherwise bass-driven elements that make up Nu-Metal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>As I mentioned, I knew it'll all come down to fucking semantics.</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still enjoy Mudvayne, Slipknot, Static-X, if you consider any of them Nu-Metal.  Karnivool are probably considered it, too, and hell, they're awesome.  Disturbed and Korn I can take in small doses. <br/> 
 <br/> 
These are the only bands I'm thinking of when it comes to the goods of Nu-Metal, mind you, so perhaps we need to further define our terms.

      Nu-metal, in my mind, was also typified by the simplistic and often repetitive guitar riffs, lacking traditional 'lead' parts, as well as the simple structures, rather than just the combination of rap and hard rock. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But agreed, all the bands you mentioned are basically what I think of as nu-metal too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was bands like Korn and to a lesser extent limp-dick-biscuit that were genuinely doing something new and original at the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However bands like Deftones, and more recently 36Crazyfists, were maybe originally nu-metal, but have grown and developed with each album, and now can not be associated in any way with the genre. Korn and Slipknot limp-dick etc all did not do this, and now sound like their own covers band, all bashing out the same tired old songs on each album. <br/> <br/> <br/>

      Well, no, I don't equate nu-metal with rap rock. Like you said, much nu-metal falls outside of that, and conversely, there's a lot of decent rap rock that no one would call nu-metal (E-town Concrete, NJ Bloodline, Stuck Mojo, etc.) What I do equate it with is predictable cliched angst, ridiculous posturing, lyrics that are made up as one goes along, overuse of expletives to show how tough we are, grating vocals that manage to be both whiny and raspy at the same time, and a basic inability to string a melody together. One can hate on emo, but at least most of those bands know how to put some minor chords together into a tight chorus - most nu-metal bands barely knew how to play their instruments and invariably would end up putting a major where there needs to be a minor or a flat where there needs to be a sharp. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess the bands you listed aren't the worst examples. I too have a few exceptions: Onesidezero, Deftones, Guano Apes, and Passenger, but three of those are fairly obscure anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At any rate, I think nu-metal pretty much became obsolete when metalcore came along.

      This and the last strip have had  <em>Deep in the Woods</em>  floating around my brain for the last few days. <br/> 
 <em>The woods eats the woman and dumps her honey-body in the mud<br/>
Her dress floats down the well and it assumes the shape of the body of a<br/>
Little girl<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I recognize that girl<br/>
She stumbled in some time last loneliness<br/>
But I could not stand to touch her now<br/>
My one and onlyness.<br/>

Deep in the woods<br/>
Deep in the woods<br/>
Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging.</em> <br/>

      I kind of get the idea that the Allman Brothers were a ruse with intent to lull. Maybe he acknowledges more than two songs in the world, but he picked the two he knew would make Ray spill his secrets? That would make sense in the context of Mr. Band, anyway. <br/>

      That reminds me of a a creepy Brecht/Weill song: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Als sie ertrunken war und hinunterschwamm <br/> 
Von den B�chen in die gr��eren Fl�sse <br/> 
Schien der Opal des Himmels sehr wundersam <br/> 
Als ob er die Leiche beg�tigen m�sse. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Tang und Algen hielten sich an ihr ein <br/> 
So da� sie langsam viel schwerer ward. <br/> 
K�hl die Fische schwammen an ihrem Bein <br/> 
Pflanzen und Tiere beschwerten noch ihre letzte Fahrt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Und der Himmel ward abends dunkel wie Rauch <br/> 
Und hielt nachts mit den Sternen das Licht in der Schwebe. <br/> 
Aber fr�h ward er hell, da� es auch <br/> 
Noch f�r sie Morgen und Abend gebe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Als ihr bleicher Leib im Wasser verfaulet war <br/> 
Geschah es (sehr langsam), da� Gott sie allm�hlich verga� <br/> 
Erst ihr Gesicht, dann die H�nde und ganz zuletzt erst ihr Haar. <br/> 
Dann ward sie Aas in Fl�ssen mit vielem Aas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
translation (not mine): <br/> 
 <br/> 
When she had drowned and floated down <br/> 
From creeks on into each succeeding course, <br/> 
The opal of the sky most grandly shone <br/> 
As if it were required to soothe this corpse. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then kelp and algae caught along her side <br/> 
Until at length her form became immense. <br/> 
The fishes coolly swam along her thigh, <br/> 
Her last trip burdened so by animals and plants. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And with evening, the sky turned dark as smoke, <br/> 
Then saved its light suspended in each star. <br/> 
But the brilliance of the dawn seemed to evoke <br/> 
A morning and an evening still for her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As her bleached body decayed along the weir, <br/> 
It happened (gracefully) that God in time forgot her: <br/> 
First her face, then her hands, and last her hair. <br/> 
Then she flowed, with other carrion, from the harbor.

      I remember a couple years ago on Halloween when my friend and I came into possession of a jar of moonshine.     The last thing I remember is throwing eggs at a passing train and accidentally hitting the conductor through the window so he slammed on the brakes.  We ran off. The rest of the night got pretty fuzzy, and in the morning there was a plaster Elvis head impaled on a broken off crutch in our living room.  No idea where it came from.

      I forget where I saw someone tried to explain the total absurdity of the Truther claims by estimating the cost of a government cover-up of 9-11 through hush money (keeping in mind that the cover-up and payoff plans were 100% successful). I think it ran into the trillions.

      The thing is I hesitate to dismiss this completely in theory. If you look up Operation Gladio or any of our involvement in South/Central America - stuff that has all been proven and declassified - something like the 9/11 conspiracy does start to seem more feasible. I think what it really comes down to is just a matter of the execution of something on so grand a scale being pretty unlikely. I have no doubt that at least some elements of the government (the PNAC, some of the CIA, etc.) would have no qualms about doing something like this if only they could pull it off. So in theory the ideas of the 911 truthers aren't entirely ridiculous. In practice, however, you just have to look at their rhetoric and the quasi-religious way in which they proclaim their slogans to know that something's not quite kosher about them.

      I think that if you know anything about what it takes to demolish a building, any claims involving controlled demolition are indeed entirely ridiculous, even in theory.  It's really a shame that serious people give this nonsense any space to breathe.

      Well, there are different theories, ranging from the totally ridiculous "Bush and Cheney were mustached villains laughing maniacally as they pushed down the level on a big box marked "TNT" a few blocks away" variety to the slightly more plausible "Bin Laden and the CIA are in cahoots" or "The CIA knew about it but let it happen" variety. I'm just making a point that the absurdity is in the execution, not that "our government would never do such a thing!"

      Jkustes, I thank you for this.  In view of what it says, I had to see what other wisdom you had posted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was saddened to see you had only one other:  the one about how graphic design is easy and there are only 5 designers in the world.  And here I thought you were making a sarcastic joke about that.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Silly me. <br/>

I can't wait to see the important issue you break your silence on next!  Obviously yours is a penterating intellect.
