      Todd's relative size to the stain's stated height of "about a foot up," he would require killer arc to accomplish that feat; given his propensity towards a mind-and body-damaging lifestyle, it would be highly unlikely that he could manage said feat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Examining the list of potential suspects for those who could A) have access to Ray's couch and B) lack the proper etiquette (without a tendency to favor other forms of bodily-fluid vandalism, e.g. Lyle), I must reach the logical conclusion that Little Nephew was gettin' his bone on, which makes the issue far more disturbing on many levels.

      If we were to use the principles of Occam's Razor then we would have to come to the conclusion that it was infact Ray! The theory with the least assumptions is that Ray was out of his head and left the stain, but in the morning he couldn't remember.  <br/> 
My main piece of evidence to this end is the fact that Ray is eating only a can of refried beans for lunch which is generally a behaviour attributed to the morning after a binge of some kind of substance.

      naw, here's how you do it: <br/> 
 <br/> 
First off, it's gotta be Refried BLACK beans.  Pinto just sucks balls.   they gotta be warmed up, nice and piping hot, then you add a can of mexican tomatoes, and some sauteed garlic and onions.  mix all of that together, add a couple shots of hot sauce (your choics), some pepper and a hint of salt (optional, the beans usually take care of this for you).  Let this get nice and hot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the meantime, while that's heating up, get a cast-iron skillet and heat it up.  get white corn tortillas (the small ones) and brown them.  NO BUTTER OR OIL i am serious, you not going for fried here.  once they starting to get a few tiny little black spots on a side, you flip em and do the same on the other.  grill up about five of these to a can of beans.  roll em up and serve alongside your beans. one of the best mexican comfort foods i've ever had. enjoy.

a note about browning tortillas: it's a good idea to splash a few drops of water on them and rub that around. don't soak it, just some lubrication to keep the tortilla from sticking to the pan. cause that kind of thing just ruins my day. <br/>

      Ray is classy enough to know that when describing a universal problem of a seminal nature to a friend of slightly circumstances via telephony, a choice of lunch that is common in three senses of the word will establish a commiserative tone of cool attitude between dogs, enabling a "hey man" back and forth to initiate with everyone involved all shootin the shit and splittin the piss streams until the conversation evolves into enlightened breast man topics.

      Hmmm... Little Nephew is the obvious suspect, but I think he's a red herring.  Beef is defensive, but he wouldn't do this.   Maybe he is protecting someone else.  I'll go with Showbiz, who came back for the wedding and Beef has been hiding him in the pool house.  Showbiz snuck into the living room at night and was taking an inappropriate amount of joy in Ray's Magneplanar speakers.  The area directly behind the couch is the location of the acoustic imaging focus. <br/>

      I think the jacket/cocktail accessories are more of a default setting for when Ray is inside, alone, and not otherwise occupied. <br/>

I further speculate that every single room in the house has a hook next to the door, jacket hanging, ready for use; as well, a small but well-stocked bar with chilled glasses standing by.  No matter where he is, the default setting can be attained.
