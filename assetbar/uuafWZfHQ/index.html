      If he were fatter, he'd need it to see his junk.  As it is, maybe he's giving his belly a look at itself, as though that is where diabetes is lurking.  "See this?  I'm losing you!"  Which is the effect of what he actually says to diabetes, so that's most likely. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That, or he's dissociating, and thinks Ray's belly, not Ray, is the one who needs to lose weight.  Or it's just some more semi-surreal shit that Onstad threw in there to change the effect of the panel.  Without the mirror, it would be a much sadder image, I think - just a fattish guy looking at his belly and seeing his own mortality. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Note that the mirror shows the correct reflection for how it's held, with the roll of fat and the belly button at a slight angle.  I think it's cool how Onstad pays attention to such details.  His minimalist drawing style is not an excuse to leave things out, but a way to put just the right things in.
