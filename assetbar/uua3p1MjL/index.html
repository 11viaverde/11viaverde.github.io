      I think you may have misunderstood rallying, its not like you get points for ploughing through crowds. Its  <em>racing</em>  not brutal violence.  <em>accidents</em>  sometimes happen; if the course layout is such that the spectators are standing in a completely stupid place, they get destroyed. The sport is not bad, the organisation is often completely retarded. <br/> 
look what you made me do, i'm not even a rally fan.

      Auto racing is, was, and always will be a sport. The risk to life and limb, the peak physical condition required, and the years of dedication and training required to compete push far beyond the envelope set by most sports. Even if you want to go against NASCAR you have to contend with 3 things: on the super speedways like Talladega the race is 500 miles long, the interior temperature of the car approaches 147-155 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale, and for the duration of the track the average G force acting laterally on the driver is  4 times that of earth's gravitation. Drivers often lose as much as 27 lbs of fluids in a single 500 mile circut. No other sport has those kind of extremes. Only auto racing.

      You're confusing sports with astronautics, my friend. From a standpoint of pure physical endurance, sure, it's impressive. But I imagine that it would take a similar number of years of dedication and training for one to be able to fuck oneself in the ass. That doesn't mean I want to watch it. That doesn't make it entertaining. That doesn't make it a sport.

Also, who the fuck would want to put themselves through that? I guess if some guy came up to me and said "Hey I'll give you all this money if you walk 500 miles in desert heat with extreme high winds!" <br/>

      Yes. I have played it. I have watched it. Playing it is fun, you get to swing at a ball, and on the off chance that you hit it, you run really fast to first base. Once you get there, you have about 5 minutes(10 for professionals!) to wait before you get to do anything else of a physical nature. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then when your team's out, you wait for half an inning, catch a fly ball, then wait for the rest of the inning to be over because in any given inning, you are unlikely to need to actually do much. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pitchers are the only people on a given baseball team consistently making an effort to do something.

      I remember when I was a kid being so befuddled as to why my dad liked NASCAR. I would sit there with him and ask, "So, they just go around and around?" "Yeah." "At almost the same speed, but pulling off and on?" "Yeah." "For how long?" "Hours." "So why are you watching it?" I was always pretty sure it was just for the wrecks.

      The site mentioned in the alt text doesn't seem to work anymore. Clicking "car accident videos" just leads to one of those generic paid search site things.

      Fived for Beef at the pinnacle of the Engish Language. Too many car comments relative to abject, worshipful Beef-adoration...'extremely special'...'Dogg you know I ain't got the kind of mind it takes to cook frittata you know I got no sense of eggs YOU KNOW I GOT NO SENSE OF EGGS'... Beef is highlighting the recursive nature of depressive loops: even a relatively high-functioning depressive can be sent into a tailspin of inability by untoward stimuli like the sensation of being rushed to accomplish an otherwise doable deed. Also, being angry or otherwise sub-optimal with friends you've enlisted to help...sometimes I think that Onstad's dedication to occasional, deep, dark psychological realism in the midst of the ridiculum is what makes Achewood so much more engaging than even the few other comics that actually manage to be funny. Oog. Too long. Cereal with grain milk, bannana, cinnamon and peanut butter are to blame. And me.

      I heartily agree with you. This discussion of motorsports was harsh and not friendly.
