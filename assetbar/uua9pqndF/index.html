      Tacos? You sir, I suspect, are thinking of the noble  <em>burrito</em> . In these parts it'll run the size of a small dog for $5 or so and give you all the calories you need for an entire day. You take that baby "super" (guacamole/avacado, cheese, and sour cream if you're the kind of sick deviant that can tolerate sour cream) and you're looking at a serious flab-building program. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're also looking at one of the greatest things to ever come out of San Francisco. <br/>

      I've never said we're the best at everything (for example: our transit is horrifying, our city planning nonexistent, we have terrible weather, and as a former Kansan I truly lament the terrible state of barbecue here), but I will say that we most definitely have some solid credentials when it comes to burritos. To say otherwise is laughable. You don't have to admit that New York is the epicenter of the world, but you would be remiss in saying that they do not know what they're talking about when it comes to pizza.

      True, but burritos are a pretty big thing here. It's also somewhat related because of the strip being set in a fictional suburb of SF. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Re-reading it I guess I could have neglected to mention the origins of the sort of burrito I was referring to and the one that I assume would be the base of Ray's flab-building program without altering the basic nature of the statement. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do go on about this city too much though. You're entirely correct there. New Yorkers often do the same thing though. It's not entirely a unique thing.

      Stop calling it "Chipotle's"!!! It is just "Chipotle". Why the possession?!?

In fact I do not trust any roadside stand for food that isn't BBQ. <br/>

      I always trust food on the street more than other food. I mean, you can often weed out the cheap crap easily, but otherwise, this is a small struggling business and more likely to be authentic and good than some asshat with a chain or mediocre neighborhood place just getting by due to laziness on the part of the locals.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If it's any consolation the best local BBQ place just makes me weep because it's not good enough. Also, they have shitty sauces and no decent KC style sauce. They don't have burnt ends. The meat is good, albeit not great, but the guy is one of those anti-sauce types and sauce is key to proper KC-style BBQ. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't get the taquerias without paying a pretty hefty fee in return. Oh and we have a lot of really bad Indian food in the city. You have to go over to Berkeley (which has a sizable Desi population) to get the good stuff... or so I'm told.

      from the perspective of a native Southeastern person, culturally we aren't nearly as accepting of roadside stands as, say, New York. I also disagree that just because a business is "struggling" or "authentic" it makes its product better... That said, I now go to school up in Yankeeland, and yeah, street food's often a good sight better than what I can get at a big chain or the shitty supermarket down the block.

      Whenever I watch No Reservations or such I really lament that lack of street food in this country. I mean, look at other countries around the world. There is some great, dirt-cheap food being served on the street. I lament it's lack here almost constantly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We don't even really get much in the way of hot dog carts, pretzel vendors, or churro stands here. I mean, actually you can get all three, but it's uncommon and always the same crappy chain selling old vaguely-warmed versions of each. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not paying $3 for a churro that's been sitting around all day. I should be getting a freshly fried one for $1. Actually, I know a place for that in Oakland right outside the BART station where that guy was shot on New Years. My girlfriend used to get off at that station for work every day.

      I had a few Lucky Dogs during the time in which I lived in New Orleans. That cart just always seemed to be stopped outside the bar which I had adopted as my own at that time. I was always either steeling myself for a long bike ride or streetcar trip back Uptown, so I sometimes sought to quell the beery fire with said dogs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It rarely ended well. <br/>

I do not miss this particular strain of street food.

      No sensible person would ever go to Tampa. Plus, well, I'm not exactly a BBQ snob, but I grew up with KC style BBQ so I'm happiest with my regional preferences there. I'll get some the next time I visit my parents. <br/>

Sadly I want the BBQ, but I don't want to see them.

      Chicago and SF have a lot in common really. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Our rivalry with L.A. is more justified though, but it's mainly just one-way: we hate them and they think we're cute and picturesque. <br/> 
 <br/> 
New York enjoys a rivalry with everyone who says that New York is not the greatest place on Earth. We often just try to justify how we're just as good as New York and why we would never want to live there anyway.

It's a shame too. Most other world capitols are in the major cities of the country, but not us. It's kind of like how state capitols are almost never the major or most important city of the state. I think Austin is one of the few cases where it's even in a city where people would want to live.

Ken Berry was not from Chicago. I never saw him around, so I cannot confirm that he has ever been there.

      A burrito made with rice, beans, meat and salsa wrapped in a tortilla is not correct? How can you cut it down any further? I will fully acknowledge that the super burrito is most definitely the gringo version, but if you want it more authentic I doubt you're going to have that many problems with a solid burrito sesos. I don't think they're selling a lot of ojo to the Americans.

      I see your point, but it's become the dominant form of burrito in the area. It's no longer a novelty like it is in many other areas. If you order a burrito anywhere around here that's what you're gonna get. Honestly I find it to be the ideal size and don't get complaints that they're too large. I've never seen one larger than my head.

Maybe also because, growing up in a Puerto Rican household, I've always felt that Mexican rice is inferior to the Puerto Rican Variant.

      Your statement is in correct because in implying that you want to watch MORE Burn Notice you are reversely implying that there are people who watch LESS Burn Notice, also implying that there is a limit to how much Burn Notice one can watch, as in "I want to eat MORE food" and then "I need to eat LESS food now, because I am full." <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is impossible to get full on Burn Notice, there is no such thing as too much of Burn Notice.

      1st season was weak but once they revealed the extent of the conspiracy at the end of Season 1 and throughout Season 2 it got better. Alias was the same way. <br/>

Burn Notice is more "Magnum P.I. in Miami with more 'splosions" though, because Micheal rarely creates something out of nothing for daring escapes.

      Nothing will equal  <em>The Equalizer</em> . Edward Woodward is just so damn hard! My wife gave Burn Notice the name 21st Century MacGuyver after Micheal improvised yet another spy gadget/explosive/weapon out of everyday household objects. She also gave NCIS the name "Navy Cops" and if there was any justice in the world that is what the show would be called.

 <br/> 
... and yet, and yet, though were I trapped on a desert island with these cultural under-dwellers I know I would sooner strangle them and give them to the sea than feed their tainted flesh to my starving bikini concubines, I know that somewhere, somewhere, there is a man to whom they are the apple of his eye. <br/>

      Last summer, I visited Europe with a few friends. One of our last stops was in Munich, from where you could go visit Dachau, the site of the first concentration camp. When I mentioned the possibility of going there to take a look, my friend said that it took a while to get to and required several bus transfers. My response was "that's okay, I'm sure I can get there much quicker." <br/>

      This is a question that requires another boring story. We got there on the weekend and had a rather busy two days where my friends struck up a  <em>connaisance</em>  with two German sluts at a bar while I was having an intense conversation about LSD and The Cure with the beautiful redhead from California that was staying in the same hostel as us. There was obvious attraction and yet I failed to make a move and then she was gone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So the next day, when my friends went to the Englischer Garden to enjoy themselves in the sun, I decided to go to Dachau. My reasoning was that maybe it would make me feel silly for feeling like shit about my own little problems. Unfortunately, I forgot that everything in Munich closes on Monday, so I just got to see the outer perimeter and some photos. Instead of gaining some valuable perspective, I just left convinced that nothing ever goes right and the world is a terrible place.

 Little is it known that this is the Gypsy's nature, its mechanism for seeing its young cared for by its competitors, while simultaneously leaving it free to reproduce far beyond its own economic means. Upon reaching maturity, the Gypsy youth will reveal its true parentage by impregnating a local burgher's daughter before escaping downstream and into its natural social environment of transiency, rejoining its kin at last, who will know it for their own by its beady eyes, and mating call of sociopathic lies.

      True. Despite their many, many failings they really had it together when it came to design. I mean, the uniforms were great, the use of red and black was classy and they totally managed to dominate in just about every aspect of aesthetics. There's a good reason why people still look to the Nazis when they're trying to find a look that just projects menace and aggression and despite the obvious desire to play up obvious comparisons the look works all on its own. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Romans also had a similar quality. Never underestimate design when it comes to an empire.

      Mildly funny anecdote: I went to a Homeopath once because I know that some of them aren't complete hacks. He prescribed me Scorpion. Which as you may have guessed is a very very diluted concoction that includes the insect after which it is named. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Awesome dreams that night. Moral is: eat more scorpion.

      I watched the episode just the other day having picked up the season 4 set just last weekend finally, but I was still uncertain, recalling from memory, if it was Potassium Benzoate or Potassium Nitrate. Which would be a lot worse. <br/>

I mean, it's just a food preservative and it's approved for use in the US. <br/>

Actually, no, Molly is clearly Beadie (not just in terms of relationship, but she has a similar look and personality). Kima will be played by Teador. <br/>

Yeah, Cornelius would make much more sense as Feamon, but there is too large of a cast and not enough Achewood.

      I'm really being a jerk, aren't I? <br/> 
 <br/> 
The best way I can say to pronounce "ue" (in most situations) is to make a sound like the "i" in "pit", but keep your lips pursed like an "o" - it ends up sounding like something halfway between the "i" in "pit" and "u" in "put", at least to my ears. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the soft r thing, I'm not sure where that came from - I think maybe they were just trying to get you to actually pronounce the "e" rather than just skipping it, as you would in English...

      It's hard to show through text that the -ew was kind of muted, and would come out more like what you described, and the r sound from what I was taught was very very soft.

      How the hell did he know the cabinet shop tool jack story? I thought I only mused about posting that.   Did I already forget?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, it was more like 1986, wasn't Gainesville, but that's okay. <br/> 
 And Johnny wasn't partners with nobody. After he got out of medium security,(which is where he learned cabinetry in the first place) he hooked up with this sad piece of tired hair, and got her to go the note for the tools. Like 40-50k worth, a very fine shop. He was a prick and when he got tired of that song, he looked for someone to unload the whole deal to, cheap. <br/>

      well, the thing is my best friend and I heard about the whole thing going on in London, but we were both busy and poor. Then several months later we heard it was moving to NYC, and we just kind of decided 'We are doing this."

Kind of like 'Stand By Me' but instead of walking on railroad tracks for 20 miles I got a job at Dairy Queen, and instead of a dead kid... well you know.

      You know, for that investment of money and time you could have got plastic surgery to make you look exactly like a female version of Daniel Radcliffe, and have money left to bribe your way into his New York hotel room and pretend to be him from a parallel universe. He'd pretty much have to show you his penis then. A friend of mine once pulled a very similar trick with Nicholas Lyndhurst and she pretty much hasn't regretted it so far.

      the layout is kind of a cop-out. i think each of the "mini-strips" would have been funnier as a stand-alone. it seems like onstad just threw together some snippets of un-crystallized ideas and put them up for production. for example, "cuddlenacht" could have been the last few panels to a classic 5 strip if it had served as a twist of some sort. and the "continuity errors" would have been an AWESOME strip, without "continuity errors" being mentioned at all. just think about it.

      Well done my good sir. Well done. I wish I knew where my copy of that album was. I had it on cassette tape at the time of release, but now I can no longer find it. The only album I've ever lost. At least it was one of his worst. <br/>

      Well, I do still have the mp3s of it and I have a small sheet that I got at one of their shows in '01 (Columbia, MO at the Blue Note right after they were held up in Oklahoma on suspicion of being terrorists a story which they related that night) so, yeah, I have some bits, but not all of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just had it refinished before the move so it wasn't in my CD rack, but I believe it was on my desk. I have no idea where it could have gone, but since I packed everything in the house to move cross-country it must be here somewhere. Probably just got misplaced in some box of rarely used stuff that I haven't gone through in the past few years since the move and has not been found since.

Tautology --- Logical truth. A statement which is necessarily true because, by virtue of its logical form, it cannot be used to make a false assertion.  <br/>

      Tautology (Rhetoric) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Repetitions of meaning sometimes occur when multiple languages are used together, such as "the La Brea Tar Pits" (the The tar Tar Pits), "monsoon season" (season season), "the hoi polloi" (the the many), "Sierra Nevada mountain range" (Snowy Mountain Range mountain range), "Sahara Desert" (Deserts Desert), "Gobi Desert" (Desert Desert), "shiba inu dog" (short-haired dog dog), "Jirisan Mountain" (Jiri mountain mountain), "shrimp scampi" (shrimp shrimp), "Mississippi River" (Great-river river) "cheese quesadilla" (cheese cheesy-thing), "Lake Tahoe" (Lake Lake), "Faroe Islands" (Sheep Island Islands), and "Angkor Wat temple" (Angkor Temple temple). The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (The The Angels Angels of Anaheim). Possibly the most extreme example is "Torpenhow Hill" (Hill-hill-hill Hill, in four languages). <br/> 
 <br/> 
The tautological status of these phrases is somewhat subjective and can be harder to detect than monolingual varieties, since they are only perceived as tautologous by people who understand enough of each of the involved languages, and because of the way that words change meaning as they drift from one language to another. For example, chai is Hindi for "tea", but in the United States, where the phrase "chai tea" is common, what is referred to as "chai" is more precisely "Masala chai." <br/>

      I never said shirt. It was a denim vest. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, unless this was completely unintentional, it's in reference to the Festivus episode of  <em>Seinfeld</em>  where Elaine is talking to a guy wearing all denim and comments on the "big metal buttons" to which he replies informing her that they're not buttons, they're snaps. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I was a kid I used to like a shirt I had with snaps because I could tear it off like Superman or a stripper. Actually I think strippers prefer Velcro-brand hook-and-eye closures.

      Dear Everyone, <br/> 
 <br/> 
The first panel suggests Lyle was somekind of functional if he has both a car he can afford to hot up and a woman he can refrain from vomiting on (frequently). He was a cabinet maker. It's possible he used to have writing chops as well from previous strips. Please make up all sorts of shit to fill in this story before Onstad does. The faster you do it, the higher the chance you'll have to kid yourself that Onstad was "listening to your genius". Ready, set, GO.

      I, too was surprised by Lyle's converted  <em>Volkswagon</em> . Look at that! Not a spot of bondo to be seen! And surely it doesn't belong to that mop-topped, slab-sided, Pepsi-can-toking harlot. <br/>

 I have, as well, known those of low minds who made good livings through cabinet-making.  <em>Very</em>  low minds. The kind of minds that would take a friend out and by the rounds, hoping to get him drunk enough to agree to a manage-a-trois with a morbidly fat-bodied woman.

      I think he's the kind of old that happens to total bad-asses. They don't get old, they just get a bit more grizzled and tough. I mean, is a mean-as-fuck biker really  <em>old</em> ? I don't think so. That dude is just beatin' the odds by being even more bad-ass. He just keeps getting stronger and stronger. <br/>

But yeah. At the same time Miami said that Lyle was still in his salad days. Doesn't seem like that would be true if he was pushing 40. That's a man ready to do some serious time, not just Lyle's weekender status. <br/>

Mid-to-late 30s though, I could buy that... maybe.

I was born in '81, but Beef looks like he's... hmm... four or five maybe? Four seems about right to put him at 14 in '91 with Ray trying to sneak Playgirl from the Waldenbooks.

      He was consistently referred to as "Uncle Joe" in my Western World History course in high school by our teacher. Our teacher was a great, great man. We spent one day discussing international intelligence agencies, another was devoted to the discovery of LSD, when we did the Zimmerman telegram most of it was the narrative of how a German officer was seduced in order to pilfer it. <br/>

He was also a drama teacher in charge of the rep company and a debate and forensics coach of some note.

      my mom has a big old-timey crush on Stalin, no matter the terrible things you tell her that he's done. <br/> 
 <br/> 
She's all like, "The times make the man!", "Kill one man, and it's a tragedy, kill a thousand and it's ______" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it's the mustache, because she also defends 'The Iceman' hitman, that cop who killed three of his wives, and Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, in his case, the mustache is implied.

      In four years, according to  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100420005126/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua1pghHz">this</a> , Phillipe will turn five, and then run in the olympics. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But will he do so for America, or for Germany?

Also, I'm excited to see what causes Ray to lose his ears. The possibilities are endless. Perhaps a mishap involving his belly chain, a hand stand, and twenty dollars.

      There's only one country that even qualified for the 1938 huggathon event and that's Bighugistan. Switzerland was disqualified. <br/>

The event was subsequently deprecated by the Olympic Committee, Germany invaded Poland, and you know the rest.

      So, what's with you folks? This strip has fewer than 1000 comments. Just when I was getting used to not even bothering reading them or contributing because, well, what's the fucking point? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, WTF? It seems to have happened overnight, bac a few months ago. I think it means that Onstad's readership has exploded in the wake of all the ecstatic coverage last year, which is great.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But essentially, Achewood is the new Digg.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But without the retarded fuckwads. And that's important. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I admit I'm staring to feel like one of those douchebags who resents it when his favorite indie band goes mainstream.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fuck me, I guess. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry for the incredibly fatuous post, but since it's buried 600 deep, so anyone who bothers to lame it (or chubby it for that matter) is simply proving that they have no life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So either way, I win. And, simultaneously, am a douchebag.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In conclusion, I'm not getting enough sleep. Or Prozac.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I dare myself to post this.

      I'm seeing this as a sort of Superman giving Batman a kryptonite bullet/ring (pre-Crisis/post-Crisis) in case he ever goes too crazy or gets too mind-controlled (which seems to happen a lot), except in this case, Superman is also a penis with glasses (I guess that'd be Clark Kent then, wouldn't it?) <br/>

For Autre and Catz: I was tired, a little delirious, I think I directly followed reading that with reading a Catgrl post much further down the page, and hadn't eaten my past few meals so my brain wasn't working right (as evidenced by my massacring of BBCode, which I normally take pride in excelling at).  This is actually all true.  My apologies. <br/>

      I didn't think anyone was ever going to read that. And if they did I wasn't planning on taking credit for it. But I felt a little selfish pang seeing it miscredited, so now that plan goes out the window. Sorry to tell you that it wasn't a young girl who wrote that, which would've made it much more interesting. <br/>

Anyway, Autre is responsible for creating the account, but a joint and a boring night at my place are responsible for the rest. I was kind of hoping that some other people would join in at some point. <br/>

      Incidentally I've only been on the actual site twice, and one of those times was to actually ask a question about anime. The rest of the Internet is sufficiently polluted. For example, just today I typed in "nom" into Google to look for cute kitten photos, and ended up at  <br/> 
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100420005126/https://www.drewpickles.com/">this site</a>  instead. <br/>

There is nothing gross in this link itself, but it is a directory listing of the most disgusting things I have ever seen. Every other image on this site makes swap.avi look like Family Circus. It has changed my life forever. <br/>

I saw a film today promising added scenes of wildly violent canibal sex, a whole sub-section at the shop devoted to Nunsploitation, a box set of Nazi women films (and without the  <em>Ilsa</em>  series), and a truly awesome-looking film with astounding cover art called  <em>Rasputin: Orgy in the Tsarina's Court</em> . Look around online for the box-art (I couldn't find a large enough copy myself, but I was lazy about it), but it looked great. Apparently done by the same guy who did the  <em>Schoolgirl Report</em>  series. It was in the all-region import section near a weak-looking copy of  <em>Battle Royale</em>  (I still don't think there's an all-region version with decent English subs of the full extended version out there... I want one badly though). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Amoeba's video section often knows how to totally bring it. They just have terrible prices for new releases most of the time. The kind of place that charges list price. Good deals on used though. I don't know why places try to stay in business selling at list. You're just going to get your ass kicked by the Internet and, well, everyone else. They're a big enough store to be able to discount it too, but then again, they're also a major destination shop here and people get away with overpricing tons of crap along Haight because they know tourists will buy it or people will just overpay. Haight-Ashbury Music Center is especially guilty of this. I mean, who charges list for musical equipment? You expect me to pay $35 for a set of bass strings when I can get a two-pack of D'Addario online for $25 or pay about least $15 less than you're charging for the other brands?

      You lucky son of a bitch, that sounds like the greatest place ever.  Alright, alright, San Francisco is totally superior to everywhere else on Earth, on the merits of this mystical wonderland of which you speak alone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There used to be a dinky little weirdo video store in my hometown, went out of business right before I left.  They had a rental section with all sorts of strange fair, and pretty much anything you might've wanted for sale--new or used.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The week they went out of business they had a massive closeout sale, everything in the store: rentals, used, brand new Criterion motherfuckers.  I fought roundabout twenty nerds those couple of days ('oh man i was just about to pick that up seriously uh do you really want that its pretty gross young lady maybe just give it to me haHAhaHA'), and made out with a copy of Salo (real, legit copy) for less than 30 bucks.  Couple other ones too, but Salo was my crown jewel.  So, guess what just got rereleased?  Pft. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I've got Netflix now, and it's pretty alright.  Low stock of older, trashy horror, though.  I'd buy list price from one of those little places, just for the principle of the thing.  I want them to stick around.

      I was pissed that the movie store by me, which usually has a large selection of really weird and rare shit, did not have  <em>Martin</em> , Romero's entirely awesome and badass vampire flick. I was hoping to do a Romero double feature after watching  <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> , but instead watched the equally awesome  <em>Dance of the Dead</em> , and am now going to try to plug through the Evil Dead trilogy.

      i have actually not seen Salo, though i have been meaning to. i have, however, read the 120 days of sodom, or at least, very substantial chunks of it (i'd say about 70%) as the text appears on supervert.com. the text is actually fragmented at parts as the work was never finished and fraught with continuity errors (including which character is who). for this reason, my copy of the complete works of the marquis de sade only lists each of the perverse acts as a bulletin point with complete disregard to the overall narrative and character development, and even that still supplied some 60 pages. the reason the 120 days of sodom was so disinclined to brevity was because de sade's main [political] goal was the destruction of the ego through repetition. that is, repetition of the vilest acts of depravity until they finally lost their depraved character. at this point, we would no longer pride ourselves on our depravity, we would no longer find pleasure in it, and this would allow us to be all the more destructive because only then could destruction be an end in itself, not simply a means to pleasure or self-satisfaction, both of which could always be achieved through other means. i'm not sure if salo explores these points but in reading the 120 days of sodom, i could almost feel any erotic feelings i had slipping away into whimsy, and then finally into lack of feeling altogether.. though i was compelled to continue reading cuz i wanted to know what lied ahead, even if i knew it would not be shocking, dramatic, or acutely satisfying. i think de sade's technical term for this was %u201Cmechanical%u201D. we need to execute our libertinage mechanically, without reflection, self-satisfaction, or pleasure, for only then can we maximize the chaos towards and against traditional institutions. i don't know why i'm writing this. a small part of me agrees with de sade i guess, so i'm absentmindedly spreading the gospel. also i%u2019m really sleepy and i've already forgotten the point of this post so please forgive its irrelevance/nonsensicality. also, read justine and juliette. they are the opposite of the 120 days of sodom in that each act of perversity contained therein serves a dramatic role and is thus emotionally if not erotically satisfying (for me it was often both). that is all.

      Nah. It's mainly a great big huge music store that just happens to have a pretty solid movie section. They seem to care a lot more about their store in LA which I suspect was custom-built for them to be huge. They started over in Berkeley as a pretty big store and over here they got famous for being giant (it's a converted bowling alley) and awesome and having great prices on used stuff and plenty of stuff that's collectible, rare, and/or vinyl. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I say there was a Nunsploitation section I mean there was a card for the nine or ten films in their cult/exploitation section (itself large and with a nice cult directors area). They're a very good shop to find hard-to-find stuff, but they're also big and with bad prices on stuff that's mainstream and easy to find. But if you want used copies of Criterion's Brazil set on DVD? Hell, there were like four or five there the other day for a good price (like $30 I think for the used). <br/> 
 <br/> 
You guys ever get out here for the meet and it'll be basically impossible to not go there. It's huge and it's only a few blocks from my apartment.

      belgand, we are hell of kindred. who else but you would know of ilsa she wolf of the ss. we must get together and watch this immediately! i <3 ilsa 4ever! <br/> 
 <br/> 
i looked up rasputin: orgy in the tsarina's court and i am distrustful of the illustrations. i fear that films relying on illustrations for cover art might do so because the scenes themselves would discourage viewers from buying it. but the concept is fascinating, i'll grant you that. i found the art on hkflix.com, on which it has a 4.8/5 rating, a good sign. however, it is no longer being sold there or anywhere else, so it seems, save for on VHS (why?). i will find a way to torrent it, yes i will.

      I am given to understanding that the Ilsa series is one of the main exploitation series and is pretty much something that a lot of people are in the know about. I don't mean this as a slight though. You are definitely super-awesome for being into it. Still, it's mainly just an outgrowth of women in prison movies and the constant influx of wanting to throw in more degradation and BDSM themes into sexploitation films. Really it seems inevitable that it would occur. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you must have Rasputin it was $10 on all-region import DVD. I almost bought a copy for a friend to send her for her birthday while they still have it in stock. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Illustrations are always better than the film. This is the way of things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A shame you don't live out here. I need a wicked cool female co-degenerate around again. I mean, I need to watch  <em>School of the Holy Beast</em> , but I don't have anyone to watch it with. And who is going to help me through my big sukeban list? I'm not going to be able to consume all this pinky violence on my own. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Man, I think my girlfriend could totally pull off a costume as Madeleine from  <em>Thriller - A Cruel Picture aka They Call Her One-Eye</em> , but it's not her thing. I mean, it would be bad-ass and fairly cheap and easy. Plus, c'mon, Lindberg was a major softcore star (from an era of better softcore) and centerfold. What lady would not want to be her in her most bad-ass role?

      It totally was. I'm not normally a fan of Pixar. Well, I mean, they've done some good things, but they've also made a lot of crappy or mediocre films even if they're technically accomplished. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Monsters Inc. was pretty good, Incredibles was, well, incredible, and Wall-E was good. Those are basically the only ones I like. Finding Nemo was terrible, but not anywhere near as bad as A Bug's Life.

      Both Toy Story's were amazing, probably the best movies they have or will ever release (Incredibles not withstanding). <br/>

      That's not saying much. Most of those films are completely unwatchable trash that degrade our culture as a whole. <br/>

I only say the first Toy Story and while it was technically impressive at the time it didn't do anything else for me.

      It seems to me that the worst things /b/ has to offer tend to be just sexual in nature, or just gory, and not that bad.  I can handle goatse .. . I've seen wide open orifices before.  Old people doing it?  Please.  The worst popular shock photos/videos I think are tubgirl and two girls one cup.  I did not see swap and I did not click on any of the images on that site.  I do not plan on it, either. <br/> 
However, I am waiting for the worst one yet.  It will be a video, not a photo, because photos are nothing.  And it will combine sex with gore and will almost certainly depict something illegal.  A nine year old girl being raped while being skinned alive.  Something totally horrifying like that.  Something that would be in 1001 nights of Sodom.  4chan ain't done nothing like that yet, as far as I'm aware.  But one of these days it will be posted, and will be the biggest shock image/video in the world, and people will look at me and say "it was this perv's idea".

      The worst images on that site are generally medical-type photos of rotted genitals with STD's, gangrene, maggots, etc. There is also an swf file of a guy putting his dick in a tourniquet and slicing it off. And there is something like 2girls1cup with two Japanese girls, except the stuff is real and not just chocolate ice cream with walnuts that they ran through a blender. And yes, there is stuff involving gore, executions in third-world countries, etc. <br/>

Tubgirl is nothing at this point. Everyone's seen it so much that it's acquired the status of a familiar logo or symbol.

      I will admit to being of lesser stomach than the Goodwill girl (Well, she is getting marries, ha cha cha) but I had a quick gander over that site, looking at the thumbnails of the more innocuously-named images. I stomached the sharkbite one enough to go full size, was bemused by some of the odder hentai offerings, and I admit to laughing for far too long at the one of the baby being kicked in the head. Hehehehehe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I left when I decided, against my better judgment, to bring up the thumbnail of the one titled PainThisHasGotToHurt.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I did not focus on it. But it's brief presence in the corner of my vision was enough to scare me away from ever going on that site again ever and, to a lesser extent, the internet as a whole. <br/>

 Fwiw, I really liked your silly toy duck avicon. It was devastatingly hilarious whenever you wrote some response that was utterly witty or crushing and there's this silly duck gaping off wall-eyed. "Who said that?" <br/>

If you do not like the strip and are just going to waste time telling everyone it sucks, do not come here.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is a difference between saying "hey you know, this one isn't really doing it for me" and "YO DAWG THIZ COMIX SUCK" which is what you basically said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
No one is forcing you to read it and you aren't paying to read the comic and furthermore Onstad is not OBLIGATED to give you mind-shattering goodness in every single strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus you are so far in the minority as far as people who didn't like this strip vs. people who do that you are essentially the equivalent of the 10% of Amuricanns who still think Bush is doing a good job of running Amurica. <br/>

      I lamed you too, and I did it because I think it is lame to say, "If you don't like the current situation, go away" (and in more dickish terms). It's like the people who tell other people to leave a country if they don't agree with the government's policies. Just because you don't like one part of something doesn't mean that you don't support it as a whole. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm guessing that most people who take the time to comment here love Achewood, and honestly, I've been a bit disappointed lately too, not because I don't love the strips but because I keep getting excited to see "new strip coming tomorrow" at the top of achewood.com and subsequently disappointed when it doesn't happen because Onstad's life appears to be so busy right now.

      It's all about  <em>The Tao of Montgomery Scott</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mr. Scott always told Captain Kirk that the repairs would require more time than he actually needed.  That way, if all went well he would get done early, and be a real hero.  If it took much longer than he thought, he could still finish by the deadline. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Think about it.  If your mechanic tells your it will take two hours, and it takes four hours, you are going to be annoyed at how long it takes.  If the mechanic says six hours, and it takes four hours, you are going to think that you have a super mechanic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Either way it takes four hours.  Expectations make that a short time or a long time.  So control the expectations.

 You wanna know who were the biggest alkies? It was the painters because the only thing that'd cut a lacquer buzz was liquor. Lacquer and liquor, preferably hard. Week in, week out. <br/> 
After 15 years they'd have a potful of money and no liver, kidneys, heart or lungs. Then they couldn't work anymore, then the money ran out, then they were dead. <br/>

      I forget where we had the fast/slow zombie conversation, but if you want a good mix of slow shambling brain eaters and fast-as-holy-fuck living barely dead, you owe it to yourself to check out  <em>Dance of the Dead</em> , which is totally not an adaptation of the Richard Matheson but instead a fairly decent zombie-meets-prom flick that was unfortunately released direct-to-DVD. GET THAT SHIT NOW it is fantastic.

      Shoo, for a minute there I thought you were recommending that awful Master's of Horror.  About single-handedly ruined my opinion of Tobe Hooper, Richard Matheson, and Robert Englund.  I've read the Richard Matheson story, and it was a sturdy little tidbit.  Not that ridiculously over-long titshow.  Why would anyone even bother to spend that much time and money at the Cafe du Mad Max there, where they just electrocute dead bodies into sort-of convulsing?  I imagine the youtube clips would be enough. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll look for Dance of the Dead, I saw a pretty good "zombie" style movie the other night called The Transmission.  More hyper-aggressive unkillable people, not straight zombies--good nonetheless, and of that style of horror.  Comes with my approval.  It's instantly available on Netflix.  ((im sorry assetbar i just got netflix so im kind of not shutting up about it wherever i go))

After watching the non-Masters of Horror  <em>Dance</em> , it is a thoroughly badass and totally competent zombie flick. Some of the events that lead up to the end were too predictable, much like  <em>Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog</em> , but much like the aforementioned film, it is really good. <br/>

      Also don't blame Richard Matheson for that shit flick.  <br/>

I don't see how one could fuck up that short story, it is probably the most easily adaptable of his short stories that I have read, next to maybe  <em>Mad House</em> .
