      Man, ever since I read that first asset of yours I cannot stop listening to Spiderland over and over again.  <em>What have you done to me?!</em> <br/>

And that was actually a frighteningly accurate portrayal of his desperate cry at the end. That part never fails to give me the chills.

      It's sort of telling - the captain is the guy who's supposed to be in charge of the ship; he's a masculine figure, usually a strong one. When there's a crisis, his first response is to blow his head off, perhaps in view of a little girl.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you think about it, Achewood is all about masculinity and the way that different people react to it. Look at the death of Leo Fontanette Cadillac, whose inability to forgive and general type-A personality drives him to a lonely death in a cornfield. Or the Great Outdoor Fight, which is essentially a chance for three thousand men to mutilate each other for absolutely no reason. We cheer for the masculinity, but we're also aware of how stupid the whole idea is.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It even extends to the main characters. Ray is constantly trying to display his wealth in an effort to bolster his self-esteem - when confronted with a rival, he's unable to cope, eventually turning his opponent into a parody of a man. If you go back through the archives, you see examples of masculinity at its worst - Lyle's drunkeness, Teodor's passive-aggressive behavior, Phillipe's naivety, Roast Beef's depression, Ray's vanity and pride, Todd. To be sure, they have many positive qualities as well, but Achewood is a strip about men's failures. (That's part  of what makes it so charming; we can empathize.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suppose that I could talk about the shortcomings of the female characters, but there aren't many. Molly's the only one that we've seen on a regular basis, and while she's got a sharply defined personality in her blog, we don't see enough of her otherwise to really say what her faults are. (Well, her short-tempered refusal to try to understand Beef when he's doing one of his things, but she lives with the guy.) <br/>

      Astute, but as a lady person, I feel compelled to note that Achewood's pervasive masculinity doesn't seem conscious on Chris' part, but rather sort of a default.  The dudes in the strip have never mentioned having a female friend, women only come up in a sexual or familial context.  It's a sort of very masculine idea to think of girls as not being people that you can be friends with just like a dude.  Women in general seem to be pretty enigmatic to all these guys, and I guess in my mind that attitude is so pervasive in every aspect of this comic that it extends to the author. <br/> 
Doesn't make it any less funny to read.  Just sayin'.

      That's probably true, but after seven years of doing the strip I'm willing to bet he's noticed this about himself by now. The awkwardness of the boyz around chickz has gotten more exaggerated along the line, so I reckon he's realized it and run with it rather than share with us his early experiments in the art of writing well-rounded autonomous females.

      Interesting, but odd. As a man I've had a few good male friends, but I've also had plenty of good female friends, often at times when I really had no male friends at all. It depends on the person, yes, but I think it is also an issue that some dudes are just not willing to consider. A girl is someone you can make bukkake jokes with just as easily as a guy. Just don't be so afraid about it. <br/>
