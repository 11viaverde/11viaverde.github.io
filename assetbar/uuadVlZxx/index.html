      Stouts are members of the ale family of beers, as are porters.  They are produced by top-fermenting yeasts and at a much higher temperature than lagers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In fact, the Irish name for stout, "leann dubh" translates to "black ale".

      Thing is, Guiness is only good if you drink it in Ireland, brewed in Irish casks. Anywhere else, the formula is different. english Guinness is just about passable, American tastes like cat phlegm, and Taiwanese is downright undrinkable.

      Taiwanese (or "Formosan") Guiness is in fact popular only because the word "Guiness" has a vague similarity to the words "Kwih N'Gnuh", meaning "Auspicious Orgasm/Conclusion". The Taiwanese ad campaign for guiness involves a series of billboards in which a man (or more rarely, a woman) experiences good luck while drinking a Guiness and acheiving orgasm. Examples include a Taiwanese mill worker in uniform being offered a document of promotion while he simultaneously drinks a pint of guiness and also graphically ejaculates all over a manilla envelope reading "Lottery Prize". With his free hand, the man give the traditional southern chinese symbol of exponentially increasing prosperity, which is known western cultures as the "hang ten" symbol. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The chemical formula of Guiness in Taiwan is functionally equivalent to one part Barq's root beer and one part Gurtj√•gertformulat, a German discount cough syrup removed from the market in 1989 due to its carcinogenic properties.

      I was in a strip club once and ordered a Jim Beam double, expecting to pay around $7-8, because that is the average price for the drink.  I nearly shat myself when the bartender said "that'll be $13.50".  I can buy a fifth of Jim Beam for $16, and they charged me $13.50 for two shots.

      You should go to nudy bars instead. Then you can bring your own beer, an in fact the establishment is not allowed to sell alcohol. At least, not in Texas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is the downside of them being fantastically sleazy. During one lap dance with a young lady who had a "Baby Girl" cartoon bunny tramp stamp, she began mouthing the words, "You want to fuck me? Do you want to fuck me?" Well, naturally the answer was yes, because one does not go to strip clubs for the literature and ambiance. When I didn't respond, she got angry, walked over to a table and began shouting that I was gay because I didn't want to fuck her. Turns out she was totally serious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is a strange and confusing world.

      They can't sell liquor here in California, either... which is a damn shame, considering the fact that sometimes a girl needs a little liquor in order to properly appreciate a strip club with her male friends. <br/>

      I went to such an establishment in Austin during my undergrad days.  The Yellow Rose I believe.  I saw Earl "The Tyler Rose" Campbell receiving a dance from a comely young lass at the next table.  Since it is bad form to actually  <em>touch</em>  the nekkid ladies, he made his appreciation of her talents known in a more subtle manner: We ended up naming him  <em>El Soplon</em>  which in slang-spanish roughly translates to "The Blower". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was graced by another young lass who was not as comely as Earl's.  She was rib skinny and obviously missed several required visits to the orthodontist.  However she did take a shine to me since I was not hitting on her.  I wasn't even tipping her, but she offered me a free lap dance.  She went so far as to offer me a "pink-eye wink" as she bent over - NOT to be confused with the "brown-eye, nor brown-starfish wink". <br/> 
 <br/> 
She was unceremoniously pulled from rotation before she finished the dance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Strange and confusing indeed.

      I don't know if that better or worse than cheap Pennsylvania strip clubs who can't afford a liquor license. While they can't  <em>sell</em>  beer, there is nothing keeping them from giving it away. Usually there will just be a keg in a shady alley out back.

How the fuck is a martini worth 8 dollars? It's straight up gin with like almost no vermouth at all and an olive. Am I paying 8 dollars because every bartender in the world has carpal tunnel and rattling the shaker gives them great distress?

      come on, it's  just a quadruple gin or quadruple vodka. The wank is in a glass rinsed with vermouth, a mixer only served in bars where a g&t costs at least six dollars.
