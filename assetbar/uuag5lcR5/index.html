      I'm going through these archives, and everyone succombs to the sickness eventually. After seeing that absolutely every comment that he makes is arrogant and sardonic, and he has a comment on every page, you just can't help yourself...You respond. He is the type of person who would cackle in your face, as you lose control of your body and emotions, and beat him mercelessly. The laughter would fuel your rage, and you'd beat him even more. Ifyou didn't accidentally kill him, Eventually the adrenaline would die down, and all his bones would be broken. As the EMTS came to pick him up, and put him on a stretcher, his head would slowly list back and forth. He'd crack open one eye, and slowly lift it so that it points in your direction. He'd whisper, voice breaking and cracking all the while, "Thank you, thank you for putting me in my place. you have released me from the bondage of my own hate." Then he would pass-away silently, without family or friend.
