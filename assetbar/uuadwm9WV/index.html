      I think it is pulled more from just what type of dude Ramses is and here is why. Cats in this world are obviously capable of being committed to a relationship, ie molly and beef, but Ramses has another son who rarely sees his father as well. The man is like snow in Nevada, he doesn't come around much but when he does you will remember it.

      Ray always struck me as being black, anthropomorphically speaking. I'd probably go into further detail as to why that is, but I've just realised with some consternation that I don't actually know any African Americans, so the judgment on my part was pretty much entirely based on American sitcoms.

      At first, all three cats seemed to be black, to me, and Teodor's desire to both out-dirty and please them seemed to be Sheltered White Kid Anxieties. Pat now seems like a cross between black 'Nam vets I've known and ridiculous Santa Cruz white kids. Roast Beef seemed pretty black until he called himself a "whigger," and what white cartoonist in the U.S. would give a black guy a backstory like that? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then I decided: cats can have a nationality, such as Mexican, but they cannot actually have a human  <em>race</em> . It is almost impossible for a cat to be African-American, and extraordinarily odd for a cat to meaningfully be European-American. Some cats might be ethnocentric, but they are inherently post-racist: they might identify with one human-American subculture more than another, but it's nonsense, or, at most, fashion: like the original white hippies, they can change their racial affiliation as easily as changing clothes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then I remembered that consistency was the enemy of comedy and vowed never to type this on Assetbar.

      Nah man, you're reading this all wrong. Ramses is challenging them. He's telling them what is excepted of them and leaving the decision of how to carry it out to them. Beef kind of mentions something similar to Ray after the fight is over, but that's as much foreshadowing as I want to do here.

      If I was Ray, I'd feel pretty insignificant in Ray's position too. I mean, you consider how much of a legend his father is and how little known he is. I mean, Ray is, after all, that guy you do not want people to know beat you down (Prior to this), and a guy who's bands on his own label don't know who he is. Whereas Ramses has done an untold number of bad-ass things, the amount of which surely outweigh Ray's wacky shenanigans.
