      A good question, hbananaplus! I would Chubby it but I have given out too many Chubbies on this page. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Often confused readers think that the fact that a character is an otter or tiger or "stuffed animal" really matters. Who are these confused readers? Readers who like outlining the plots of Philip K. Dick novels, who play "Call of Cthulhu" RPG's, are secretly or openly furries, who hate Lie Bot and think the GOF was Onstad's "Watchmen" and dislike any strip without Roast Beef, readers who think that "Questionable Content" rivals Achewood in terms of quality, etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A character being an animal doesn't matter, unless Onstad says it does  <em>for the purpose of a strip</em> .  <br/> 
 <br/> 
You know when you go see a magician and there's that guy nearby who narrates in shock whatever the magician does? "OH MY GOD HE JUST CUT HER IN HALF." "I KNOW THERE ARE MIRRORS BEING USED BUT I CAN'T SEE THEM." "IS HE GOING TO MAKE THAT TIGER REAPPEAR IN THE BOX OR FROM OFF-STAGE?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
The readers who point out visible nipples on a cat, or a goatee on a cat, or an otter never growing up, are That Guy  <em>qua</em>  spectators of Onstadian magic.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In other words, it is good that you ask that question because the answer is: "Yes...but really no."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If anyone is still confused, ask yourself: would it seem odd if someone kept saying "Hobbes is a stuffed animal! It's so odd that Calvin talks to him!" or "It's really odd that a stuffed animal knows economic jargon like Hobbes does?" It should, because that means they're not really engaged with the world of "Calvin and Hobbes." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Constantly pointing out the quirky conceits of a bizarre world ruins that world for others.

      Strongly agreed, though regardless of whether Nathan's read as a talking cat, a Dreamtime-derived animal-man ur-pervert, or an over-analyzed anthropomorphic cartoon, his anatomical shape and proportions seem extremely painful. <br/>

      what aristagoras said above probably applies to the specifics geometry of Onstad's drawing style, if you stop to think about it... for a variety of reasons, including limitations of the medium and the artist's skill, not everything will be drawn exactly to scale, be photo realistic, etc...

      All good here.  And I think Onstad forgot this rule by trying to make the Underground, and started off wrong by having them all as cats and stuffed animals in the Onstad home.  Understandable, but unnecessary, like if Watterson tried to explain the Hobbes conundrum in comic.

      Actually I think C&H helped me come to terms with things like that, because while I am a kind of nitpicky person, I won't nitpick the idea that it doesn't matter that they're cats or toys or not.  Same goes for Krazy Kat: doesn't matter if Krazy is a guy or girl, and it doesn't matter if it seems Offissa Pupp gay when he calls Krazy "he."  Doesn't matter.  Just read and enjoy.

      STOP DISSING THE UNDERGROUND. <br/> 
 <br/> 
SO YOU LIKE STUFF WITHOUT SETTINGS. Good! Have fun! Unfortunately you read the wrong comic to fulfill that specific desire, but I WISH YOU WELL IN LIFE! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like the Underground. I think it is Cool that the outside of places in the Underground are always dark BECAUSE IT IS UNDERGROUND. THAT IS COOL TO ME. THAT IS WHAT I FIND COOL. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe i am a simple man with simple tastes! Maybe i am a fool for liking cutesy comical assists with my suspension of disbelief! <br/> 
 <br/> 
MAYBE I AM A TROGLODYTE, BECAUSE SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF GIVES ME SO MUCH ENJOYMENT AND I THEREBY ENJOY THINGS! <br/> 
 <br/> 
PLEASE, you, and all the other whining whiny whiners who love to WHINE OH MY GOOD LIKE LITTLE GIRLS, just download all the comics onto your hard drives, select all panels that refer to The Underground in your image editor of choice (I RECOMMEND GIMP), and UNLEASH THE DELETE BUTTON ON THAT HELPLESS BACKGROUND SETTING! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then we can never have this conversation again.

      I think that at the very least, the Underground concept paid off when Teodor had Steve DeNeuve drive Phillipe to his mom's. It didn't really mention the Underground in that arc, but the 'Underground' stuff at least showed us that these cats/stuffed animals etc could not go out in public amongst humans. This 'rule' might not really be totally adhered to, for example it is kind of funny how Ray can own a record label being a cat. Who cares though, it's only comics. I think its funny that some of you people get so obsessed over these details that you have to use your vast intellects to outline any discrepancy or even contend with those who do. Who gives a fuck? It's a comic, enjoy it. I myself may pick apart movies when something happens that is obviously unrealistic, but it's a little different when you are dealing with a comic involving talking animals, living or stuffed. I especially can't see why the 'underground' stuff is brought up in these comments so often, when there were only a handful of total strips involving it, compared to the rest of the total archives. What about the strips that go the ever cliched route of 'breaking the 4th wall' and involve the creation of the strips themselves? Nobody complains about how THAT sabotages their suspension of disbelief. The fuck is wrong with you people?

      you  <em>completely</em>  missed the point of that rant. having a new/different/valid way to "gripe" is not good. <br/>

Basically, you're not really involved in or properly enjoying Achewood if the answer to that question really matters to you. Achewood is bizarre and surreal; not every question will or should be answered. Enjoy the characters, rather than picking them apart on unexplained details.  <br/>

I don't know. This story arc really seems to be a thinly veiled avant-garde exercise in seeing how much it takes to alienate an online fanbase.

      Nothing is left us now but death. We look to that with a grim satisfaction, saying, there at least is reality that will not dodge us. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I take this evanescence and lubricity of all objects, which lets them slip through our fingers then when we clutch hardest, to be the most unhandsome part of our condition. Nature does not like to be observed, and likes that we should be her fools and playmates. We may have the sphere for our cricket-ball, but not a berry for our philosophy. Direct strokes she never gave us power to make; all our blows glance, all our hits are accidents. Our relations to each other are oblique and casual. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dream delivers us to dream, and there is no end to illusion.

      I don't actually think this with any confidence, but you know where this could end? Nice Pete's death. Think about it, there has been a series of events involving Nice Pete where each time he does a horrible thing, kidnapping Philippe, trying to murder Roast Beef, Teodor and Ray, and each time they let him live despite having the means and reason to get rid of him because they presumably figure he is harmless enough left alone, and that they won't have any issues with him unless they involve themselves with him. This time however Teodor is practically whisked away in the night unexpectedly and without much choice, Nice Pete striking at him when he is vulnerable despite Teodor (or anyone else for that matter) having made no attempt at getting himself involved with Nice Pete. It's the culmination of every insane thing Nice Pete has done going into a almost the Aristocrats level of a horrible night for Teodor, purging out every bit of Nice Pete's violent insanity to the reader, and even though the characters of Achewood are quirky, they aren't idiots and it has, or will, come to the point where it is too dangerous to allow Nice Pete to live. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or you know. Not. Not to say Onstad would keep him dead very long.

      It definitely seems like the arguments used in favor of keeping Nice Pete alive before aren't going to work now, but at the same time, I have trouble seeing the Achewood characters working together to murder someone, even if that someone is a psychopath who's tried to kill them all multiple times.  If this arc leads to Nice Pete's death, it'll probably be through some ridiculous accident like a van crash that Teodor somehow survives (probably more absurd than that, but I don't have the creativity to come up with something Onstadian enough at the moment). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Really though, I want the "it was all a dream" ending not just to end this, but also because it would mean the last few panels never happened.  I'm just feeling sorry for Teodor, and it's the ending that would least scar him.

      It is a monster in Dungeons and Dragons. It may have fallen aside in favor of "cooler" and more spikey monsters with  37 to Grapple, so you may have to go back to 1st edition for the reference. The Catoblepas is a swamp quadruped with a head so heavy that it rarely raises it, but if it does and it meets your gaze you are stricken dead by the sight of it. I think you get a saving throw or something.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Classic.  <br/>

Anyway, I just couldn't think of a decent name and an old monster from a tabletop game from the 70s was what popped into mind.

      Sometimes I like art that is aggressive to its audience -- "transgressive" I think the Grad School Set call it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not, say, Batman. Batman is a cultural icon written by diverse hands. When a writer fucks him up or tries to undermine the character for edginess, they forget that they're playing in a shared sandbox. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But when a writer or poet takes a character of their own and does the unexpected, or when a musician records a personal album that is out-of-step both with current trends or the expectations of their fanbase (myself included), I take notice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lovecraft's "At the Mountains of Madness" demythologized everything. Boom! It turns out every Lovecraft story is just a precursor to this one, and Lovecraft was undermining any element of "magic" that might have made his work "fantasy." It's all nihilistic science fiction more akin to a biology and anthropology textbook than a grimoire in an occult shop ("grimoire" comes from the same root as "grammar" - you just learned something!). <br/> 
 <br/> 
So all of the post-Lovecraft fans writing magical adventure stories where trenchcoated wizards wield magic tomes  <em>don't get it</em>  or have to complain that Lovecraft's world isn't accessible to such fantasy coherence. But thank God Lovecraft wasn't limited by that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So in other words, Onstad has done so much in this arc that even if Teodor is shown to be suckin' dick next comic, stopping to look "at the reader" to say "Assetbar users are grade school fuckwit who like to diddle swans," I wouldn't be bothered.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad is working some Lynchian chuckles, which are not always recognizable as chuckles. <br/> 
 <br/> 
p.s. Onstad is better than Chris Ware, and this arc proves it.

      This arc reminds me of the swinging pirate ship ride at six flags.  For the first couple moments the alternating weightlessness and g-force fill you with glee, but then you are struck with overwhelming nausea, and the realization that you can't escape until the ride is over. <br/>

Except the ship is a van. <br/>

      Look, I'm not saying I have all the answers or anything, but I've taken a few anatomy courses at university, so I have to ask this:  How, exactly, does Nathan the Elderly Homosexual have a 10' penis growing directly out of his ass?  I'm not denying this could happen(I guess), I'm truly curious as to HOW it has happened though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or is here merely wearing some kind of freaky 'Gold Bond Elderly Homosexual Truss/Gaff' to keep it fettered? <br/>

Regardless, I think it's clear what's really going on here: Teodore is using Ol' Nate The Poof's rod to 'jimmy'(see wut I did there?!!OMFGROFLULZCOPTR!!!!) open the padlock. <br/>

      Completely with you.  Fuck the guy who posted earlier who wants to see Phillipe in some earmuffs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad is not going to be doing a GOF repeat or whatever.  He did it, it's done, he's moving on.  I feel like this arc is taking its cues from the kind of neo-noir of Cartilage Head but taking it out of the playground and making the stakes incredibly high. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One thing I love about Achewood are its characters.  They are incredibly robust, vivid, and complex.  But one thing they haven't really been is affected by the story in past arcs.  Ray from after GOF is the same Ray from before GOF.  The only instance I can think of where characters have been affected and completely changed from the story itself is Beef and Molly's relationship and subsequent wedding (maybe Pat coming out of the closet, but that's just made him gay and angry, instead of just angry). And the wedding was more recently. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, with regard to the aforementioned guy who posted earlier, who wanted some "yin" to counterbalance this "yang".  Isn't it the precisely the opposite?  Onstad is providing a game-changing "yang" to counterbalance the almost pure "yin" he's been providing for years.  Characters aren't going to remain static in the face of story.  They are going to change.  Teodor might die, and not in the answer-the-secret-riddle-at-Friendly's kind of way, either.

      For some of us, it's just that it's gone on too long with no real rewards yet. This isn't the funniest Achewood, or the most moving, and it uses a lot of faux cliffhangers and suspense cuts that take 4 days to resolve and don't actually have any pay off. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Virtually every comic in this arc has ended on some sort of cliffhanger and yet nothing really interesting happens 4 days later when we check back in. While it might pay off in the end, it's been a frustrating journey so far. <br/>

You incorrectly portray the criticism as homophobia: it's simply frustration with a poor flow.

      I'm pretty sure homophobia has nothing to do with everyone's disgust and fear. We would be just as traumatized, maybe even more so, if this was Molly or some other female. Pretty sure being terrorized by a serial killer in the back of a van for a few weeks and then being manipulated into sucking off a battered, bleeding stranger is horrific enough as it is regardless of the penis count. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We put up and even enjoyed the surreal and the frightening for many weeks- but it has been too much, and gone too far, and for too long. Especially when we were expecting a touching, warm and fuzzy payoff with the whole five-year-old-otter-comes-to-his-real-home-and-eats-marinated-rosemary-shrimp thing

      this arc might work a lot better for those who are unhappy with it if it wasn't coming at such a slow pace.  If you could just click through to the end, you might say "gee that was lame that's 5 minutes I'll never get back" and then you'd forget about it.  <br/>

      Charles Dickens published his novels in serial. Sometimes he would change the plot based on what people thought. The audience is allowed to complain. The artist is allowed to ignore them, or listen to them, or have a grand overarching vision, or whatever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem for me is not that Teodor is rocking some dude's bonch; it's that we've been kept suspense for two months without (as far as I can see) any gesture toward resolution. If I wanted to watch three-quarters of  <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>  twice a week, I would watch three-quarters of  <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>  twice a week.

      I feel like as a point of reference, look to the story arc where Philippe was trapped in the van with Nice Pete. Suspenseful but still resolved quickly and with much less torture and homosexual encounters between beaten and battered men.  <br/> 
Also, I love how if anyone mentions how they don't like a particular strip someone inevitably accuses them of being tasteless troglodytes who can only appreciate the funnies in the Sunday paper.

      Your reasoning demands that all arcs maintain consistent tone and unchallenging content, which would've rendered impossible Cartilage Head and the Great Outdoor Fight, among others.  <br/>

      My reasoning demands no such thing. In fact, it was merely a piece of evidence for someone else's argument. Direct your comments to him/her. But to address what you said, there is a difference between an epic and an unnecessarily long arc filled with... well filler.  <br/> 
Also, I'm hardly out of my comfort zone. That's not my complaint, although, I can see where you could draw that from. I've seen/read/heard a host of horrifying and disturbing materials from numerous sources. A guy sucking another older guy's dick is hardly worth mentioning in context to the other things I have seen. But what does this really have to do with the characters or the narrative arc? Is this one convoluted needlessly violent story of Teodor coming out of the closet? Will this somehow result in Teodor being rescued? Or will he die? How does this entire panel series contribute to his character? Will the scars of this story, physical or mental, be carried into other stories? I think nothing will happen from this in terms of character development or narrative arc. All of this could have been conveyed in a much more condensed form. I'm not saying that all arcs need to have absolutely condensed stories, but when the entire arc seems to be contrived of strips that needlessly show every motion of the characters rather than telling the story in as fluid motion as possible, I'm counting that as a strike against it. Especially when it is this drawn out. Most people don't even seem to realize that this entire arc with Nice Pete and Teodor is in one night. The same night that Philippe is supposed to be coming back. That's the real suspense I feel and its gone on so long that it is just banal boring cock sucking in the back of a van.

      I don't know, when clicking through the other strips when I first lucked into Achewood, I really enjoyed the times when the strip really slowed pace (such as that there strip up there). It produced a strange atmosphere. Kinda like when Bensington and Ray grew massive legs and strode across the land.

      Eh, could probably go either way. I mean, getting immersed in a nice compressed narrative is nice, and so's having something new to read every few days, but look: this storyline's only gone from wacky bullying hijinks into seriously horrifying territory in the last four strips. That's like a week's worth of content for a regularly updated comic, and for all the suggestions of something unspeakable right around the corner not even that much has happened in those four strips. A regular reader could easily miss a week due to having a basic life, trawl through the archives in a minute when they come back and have no idea what the big deal was. And yet here we are, people are  <em>freaking the fuck out</em>  like it's the End Times, the suspense and confusion is making everyone go crazy. Adorable storylines about ferrying about stuffed otter children are long forgotten, we are in the long night of the monsters and there is no escape nor respite <br/> 
 <br/> 
Try doing that in four pages of a daily strip.

      I got really frustrated with that arc when I read it in real-time, but now, it might be my favorite.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
As I've said in the past, I always wait until an arc is over until I judge it, but waiting like two days for a strip back in the day versus 4, if you're lucky, for something like the above (it's a hell of a lot of panels for not that much exposition, comedy, ambience or art), is, admittedly,  <em>really</em>  frustrating.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, hey, there's more important (i.e. worse) things happening in my life than a slow-moving story line involving large cat boners

      *bzz* wrong answer. Thanks for the grade school psychology, but no, this isn't out of my comfort zone. This is just irritatingly and poorly paced. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't expect the same tone & easy content. I expect the pacing and flow to work well (like in the Great Outdoor Fight, Cartilage Head, Secret Gelato Shop, etc). Onstad has scared us with many of his characters potential deaths over the years. That's not the problem. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem is that every single installment ends in a cliff-hanger and the resolution to each cliff-hanger is lacking. It feels (and looks like) "filler", designed to fill the spaces and make it go longer. The overall quality of the storytelling in this arc is simply not as good as Onstad's standard. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't get me wrong: there are good things going on here. However, it's not as good as some of his earlier work.

      I think the reason at least I'm a little pissed off by it (and by that I don't mean that I'm pissed off that Onstad made it, I'm just pissed off at Nice Pete and the context of the story) is that as a reader I've grown to really like Teodor and care about him as much as I can care about a character, and even if he is bi I still think being bloodied up in a van being driven by Nice Pete to who knows where and rubbing off, not a regular guy who is gay, but a rather aggresive creepy pervert who would pay a stark naked man to touch him at night at Denny's at midnight. See, there's a little more there then the gay part.

      I'm with you on this - I don't resent Onstad for this arc, and the fact that it's not fun doesn't make me hate it, but I'm blaming Nice Pete for this. I think previously I'd thought of him as being kind of just "creepy but amusing," because, as some people had said earlier, things like the Super Secret Ice Cream Shop arc had been resolved before anything truly horrible happened. This situation would still be distressing if Pat were in Teodor's place, and he's both an asshole and actually gay.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, Onstad chose to put Teodor in this situation, and regardless of sexuality it is horrible reading this happen to a character I'm attached to.

I've basically listened to "Have One On Me" throughout the work day like 5 times since I've started this job I'm currently working.  It's beyond beautiful.  And I have a very minor connection to her that makes me blush whenever I think of it like a stupid anime character.

      My breath caught when I first heard: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Black nose of the dog, <br/> 
as cold as a rifle, <br/> 
indicating with a nudge: <br/> 
God, <br/> 
No God, <br/> 
God, <br/> 
No God. <br/> 
Sweet appraising eye of the dog, <br/> 
Blink once if God <br/> 
Twice if no God." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Every obscure, bizarre notion or sentiment you've ever experienced is featured somewhere in a Joanna Newsom song. And it's in such a poetic, beautiful manner that it not only gives you the warm fuzzy healing feeling of "oh man, yes, I totally know this, YES, you explained it perfectly" but her lyrics become like... mantras. Like if I had a dime for every time "life is thundering blissful towards death in a stampede of his fumbling green gentleness" went traipsing through my head... all smacking me up and down into a Newsomy reverie. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have never obsessed over an album like I did with Ys. I know I sound like a crazy unstable emotionally fragile nutjob, and I also know that the following phrase gets thrown around a lot, but listening to Ys was like a spiritual experience. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Man, well, now the whole internet knows my Joanna Newsom feelings. Hey guys. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hey. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You guys ARE the whole internet, right? There aren't like.... MORE of you?

      I just looked those up. However, I am still listening to the animalistic/orgiastic-rock sounds of the MC5 (a discussion up the page a bit made me think of them). Long story short, these two sources of sensory stimulus, plus the  thinking Onstad has been making me do the past few weeks, are meeting up and sloshing around together back in my Basal ganglia in ways with which I am not in the least bit comfortable. In short,  <em>this</em>  is how people become furries.

      You are all reading this wrong. Teodor is not giving the old gay man a blowjob or questioning his sexuality. He is giving the battered old gay man a handjob out of pity and compassion as he knows they are about to die. All this information can be seen in his face. WWJD?

      I'm going to have to agree with you there. Teodor's had much better opportunities to pretend to be a Spartan before this, and he never took them. This is just a poor, uncomfortable substitute for the last meal before your execution.

      What would Jesus do? I would like to take a moment to bring theology to the Assetbar. <br/> 
 <br/> 
a) the Son of God wouldn't get locked in a van, or if He was locked in a van would use His super powers (Luke 4:24-32). This is actually a fairly minor reference for support, since a Messiah Who can exit a tomb sealed with Roman authorities can probably handle Hannibilly Lector's "raping van." <br/> 
 <br/> 
b) Jesus would condemn Nathan's lifestyle on grounds of God's intention for men to cleave to women (Matthew 19:3-6), thereby making the conversation rather unerotic. People think Jesus was all touchy feely, but if we take out all of the Heaven/Hell stuff, we're still left with a 1st century CE Hebrew, and they weren't big fans of men Touching men. The idea that Jesus was a catch-all Gandhi-type hippie isn't supportable from the texts or context of His culture. Also, Greco-Roman culture at the time of Christ thought big penises were shameful and stupid-looking, so if Christ was a Hellenized Jew, He'd laugh at Nathan. <br/> 
 <br/> 
c) He would reassure Nathan that he would be with Him in Paradise (Luke 23:40-43), which probably wouldn't be too much comfort in the Achewood universe. Also, I doubt he'd say "Father, forgive him, he knows not what he does" for Nice Pete. Nice Pete knows his Gospel; he knows what he is doing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, if it was Gnostic Jesus, He'd turn into a fish-lamb, turn Nathan into a spark that sings in Greek, and say that the point of life is to starve yourself weekly and avoid long lines. Again, not much help in a van.

      I do think that the Achewood comments are still not as bad as the best-commented Youtube videos.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Youtube comments are rusty iron spikes lining a pit full of fecal matter and floating cheese graters. Reading them is like throwing yourself in.  <br/>

Perhaps certain comments here are not that great. But again, the average comment here is top class compared to the better Youtube comments.

      Unfortunately there is no guarantee that the animals, stuffed or otherwise, mean the same thing as humans do when they say "inch". Without objective confirmation of the standard units of weights and measures in use in the Achewood Underworld, your hypothesis remains merely interesting rather than revolutionary.

      Note that Nice Pete is the same sort of size as Teodor, who is the same sort of size as Roast Beef.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
When Roast Beef drives his car, as in here:  <br/> 
https://achewood.com/index.php?date=06212005 <br/> 
 <br/> 
He is clearly undersized. That car is a normal-sized human car. Also clearly seen when Onstad picks up Roast Beef and Ray when they give him birthday presents.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So we can see that the cast are all on a smaller scale than humans. A human van is bigger than the Nice Van, and the Nice Van is bigger than Todd's V-v-van.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now when we look at Nathan, being about the same size as Teodor, we might say that the 10-inch dick is ten inches for them, giving a height of 3'9" for Nathan. But as iwaslikebone_ explained, a "Nathan inch" is not the same as an "Onstad inch".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the comic where Onstad picks up Ray, here:  <br/> 
https://achewood.com/index.php?date=06132003 <br/> 
 <br/> 
We see that a standing Ray gets up to Onstad's knees (or one-quarter up a normally-proportioned human). This means Ray is one-quarter (roughly) Onstad's height. Since we don't know Onstad's exact height, and we can see that Ray is actually slightly higher than his knee, and we don't know if Onstad is proportionate, we can't make a clear measurement. But a general rule of this might be appropriate: the cast is on average one-quarter the height of similar humans.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nathan and Teodor are about the same height, as seen when they are standing outside the Nice Van in this arc. Teodor and Ray and Beef are about the same height, as can be seen in The Party. Again, one-quarter the height of Onstad. Nice Pete hovers half a head above both of them, or somewhat close to one-sixteenth taller.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
This means if Nathan says he has a 10-inch dick, it is ten "Nathan-inches" which means it's something like 2.5 "Onstad inches". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I cannot locate a credible source that describes an average penis size for a cat. I found numerous uncredited references to the same short table of animals with penis lengths listed, for which a cat is given 1 inch of length. But I wouldn't trust that at all and until a reliable source can be cited I cannot continue.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I think it's reasonable to say that Nathan's cock is roughly 2.5 human inches long.

      um ahem I cannot help but observe an  <em>inconsistency</em>  in the canon Onstad in panel four of the previous comic Nathan  <em>clearly</em>  states that one of his standards for a nice dick is that it be "not too long" and yet here he is bragging about his ten-incher which is nearly double ordinary length on humans let alone catpeople  <br/> 
 <br/> 
this seems inconsistent and out-of-character pls pay more attention to this sort of sloppy immersion-breaking plot hole in the future

      Maybe for Nathan, 10" isn't too long. Consider the individual. An old, gay man who eats at denny's at ungodly hours. He grabbed a naked dude's junk (who says he's in highschool, and therefore a minor) in the middle of said Denny's. Now he's in the back of a van in his final hours trying to convince a dude to blow him. This guy has clearly been gaying it up in the most perverse ways for like a good 45 years. After that much, he obviously needs a little more than the usual to do it for him ya know?

The trick is remembering that all magic isn't inherently 'good.'  Some of it is, quite decidedly, 'evil.' <br/>

      Man, that Cracked article both gave this strip life and made the comments section a bloated mess. I read older strips, and there's only a few people in the comments section, but almost everyone was hilarious and witty. I mean now, there's way too fucking many people in the comments. 633 in 4 days as opposed to something like 100 or so on old ones that have been up for 3 years. Bothersome.

      Yo' dog, I heard you liked assets, so I put an Assetbar in your Assetbar so you could post assets about your assets! <br/>

Also, note that as we see more time between strips, people have more time to comment on them. The most-commented strips are the ones that were up on the front page the longest.

      True, but how about this: The strip that comes after this got about 330 comments in like 2 days, 3x the number on most older strips. How many people have actually read the old strips as well as the new ones?

      Let me offer a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000208/https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4806952156_62f537c64f_b.jpg">visual aid</a>  for this discussion.  It shows date along the x-axis and number of comments on the y-axis, starting with the introduction of Assetbar on 4/19/2007.  It's not really fair to compare posting frequency before then to posting frequency after, since comments on prior strips are asynchronous.  They reflect people cruising by at different times and commenting on what they see there, not a real-time conversation like the post-Assetbar comments.    That naturally means fewer posts and possibly more thought-out posts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, one thing that stands out is that there's actually been a moderate  <em>decline</em>  in posting frequency recently, contradicting rb's hypothesis.  I also don't know what range anzio has in mind when referring to "older strips," but there's been a lot of variance there since Assetbar started.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Time spent on the front page is definitely a factor in comment number, but it's not as straightforward a correlation as one might think.  One thing I found looking through the data is that anytime you get a lot of posts on a strip, you get a lot of posts on the next several strips, regardless of how long they're up.  Probably some factor of continuing conversations or habit, I dunno.  An extreme version of that is, I suspect, responsible for that  <br/> 
huge spike in October 2008.  Some Polly strip was up for 10 days without an update, which was the longest to date I think, and people went crazy with the posting.  That craziness seemingly lasted for a few months, with a boost every time a strip was up for a long time (which was happening with increasing frequency during that time period). <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Cracked article anzio mentioned came, I believe, around the time of "The Future," possibly causing the spike you see there.  It definitely slightly boosted the numbers for a little bit, but I don't know that it was a major factor in the big buildup you see some time afterwards.  I think that has more to do with the decline in strip frequency, which basically made Assetbar more of a forum than a comments list.

      Well, there you go then. Can't really argue about that. Maybe I figured the Cracked article was responsible for a lot of viewers because, well, that's how I found out about it, and a lot of other good comics I would have otherwise not been aware of. Maybe I just envy the days of old when there were very few comments, and most of them were really good. Some added a lot of substance to the comics, and it was actually plausible to read to the bottom within 10 minutes (If your read stoned, as I do).

So yeah, the deal is that when that whole "rb was here" thing happened I for some reason decided that instead of changing my status line I would just change my avatar to a picture of Roland Barthes.  I especially wanted to find one that vaguely resembled my old Yelena face, which turned out to be pretty easy because all existing images of Barthes depict him nonchalantly smoking a cigarette apparently.

      Roland Barthes I barely know anything about, except that his death was very achewoodian- he was hit by a laundry truck in Paris.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 I google Yelena and get pics of Russian polevaulters. Is not so bad, but only clue I am gettink is whizzing sound I hear all the "cultural" references you kids are knowink. <br/> 
 But, is hokay. Life, is very good for Vlad. I am not new city new job so much hanymore. <br/>

      I did not know that about Roland Barthes, that's pretty great.  For my part, I enjoy his theories on narrative. Yelena is Yelena Rossini of the comic book <i>Transmetropolitan</i>.  She was the girl in my previous avatar and the reason posters sometimes refer to me as a "filthy assistant."

      While true, have you considered this:  If Brad Anderson were drawing Marmaduke getting sexually assaulted by an enormous cat dork, for two weeks straight, he may not be as timely with his updates either. <br/>

Great...so I have to try and burn the image of Marmaduke 'getting shown who's boss' by Heathcliff out of my head now.  If that doesn't teach him to stay out of that damn birdbath, nothing ever will. <br/>

      That would last right up until Teodor passive-aggressively came home with a paper grocery bag full of prosciutto and non-organic strawberries from Argentina. Both of them all glaring at each other. Teodor knew it would come to this when he was at the store, deciding between a future with Pat and one without, the aisle of organic produce on one side and the regular produce on the other. The future with Pat cost $1 more per pound. Win-win all around.

      <strong>This is a review i wrote for mountain dew on the website www.livestrong.com but i dont think it registered so i will repost it here.</strong> <br/> <br/> <br/> THE BASiCS: Mountain dew is a soda-pop style beverage.  One should expect bubbly-ness and crispness with any soda beverage.  Mountain Dew is no exception. <br/> 
 <br/> 
FACTS: Mountain Dew is made by the pepsi corporation and is sold anywhere fine pepsi products are sold. You will find them it in both can and bottle forms at the supermarket. (At eateries it may be served in glass or plastic cup.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
OPINION: Mountain Dew is delicious.  It goes down smooth with little throat irritation. High quality product *there was a character limited of sum 4?? characters so that explains the too-the-pointness of teh review. thoughts,  <strong>(both on the review and mountain dew.)</strong>  mildly appreciated/tolerated/expected.  <br/> <br/> <br/> thansk ^_^

      There's a neat little still at the foot of the hill <br/> 
Where the smoke curls up to the sky <br/> 
By a whiff of the smell you can plainly tell <br/> 
That there's poitin, lads, nearby. <br/> 
For it fills the air with a perfume rare <br/> 
And betwixt both me and you <br/> 
As we homeward roll we'll drink a bowl <br/> 
Or a bucketful of mountain dew.

Sorry, just getting really tired of this arc. I assume another swerve will cause Teodor's dick to be bitten off. And I hate Onstad for making me imagine that! There, I said it.

      You know he does it digitally and reuses a lot of art, right?  Look at how many panels in this one are basically zoom-ins or re-angles of others, with minor adjustments (if any) to the actual faces.  Don't make excuses for Onstad's lazy ass.  It wouldn't be so bad if he'd stop doing things like promising a comic's going to go up--he only creates disappointment with all the missed deadlines.

      wanting something or liking it to the point where your whole world crumbles if you can't have it?  Obviously jmd doesn't want much in life, because there's people starving and dying and being murdered and raped in wars and such every day, and he's worried about Onstad giving him a fix of funnies on a more regular basis.  I'm not saying we should block out all awareness of our outside environment, but shit, I don't think I could ever be at peace the way jmd is, wanting nothing more than a webcomic for his world.
