      The one year I participated in the Pinewood Derby, I had a very lame car, but I actually won. As far as I could tell, the secret was the vegetable oil I used lubricate the wheels/axles, so that ugly hunk of wood got off to a really fast start, and its extra weight/mass (it was barely carved) gave my mutt a lot more momentum than the sleek, well-designed purebreds.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I held on to that trophy for a long time...

      I made a Ford Taurus for a Pinewood Derby car that won second place. The guess was that it worked because the graphite we had used to lubricate the wheels had been blown all over it by me repeatedly blowing all over it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was such a little shit as a kid. I cried that I got second place and wanted to make the third-place kid have it.  <em>Ungrateful little shit!</em>

      Did you know that the Ford Taurus is statistically the LEAST stolen car in America? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know this because I heard it on a news program about car theft a few years ago.  The only reason I remember it is because I drive a '96 Taurus myself, and whenever I am with people who talk about how great their damn fancy cars are, I state that my car is the LEAST STOLEN IN ALL OF AMERICA as a point of pride.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not even car-thieves want my car.  I dunno, I think that is kind of awesome.

      I always read this as Beef being chastised by his mother, who is concerned that he will wake Gramma K (who is a guest in the house at the time, or lives there). Thus, "your granny needs sleep!" refers to a third party, not the speaker. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He seems to look older when his father gets shot. But Ray looks about the same. Maybe he gained weight? Doesn't sound like the Beef we know, though...

      I succeeded in two separate egg-dropping contests. <br/> 
One project was a basket filled with cotton balls with plastic grocery bags stretched over the handle and a wire frame I taped to the bottom of the basket. It was hideous, but the plastic wings made it flutter very gently to the ground from two stories. <br/> 
The other (wherein we actually had to drop the egg into the contraption) was made all out of computer paper. A cone connected to a long shaft with cube-ish base full of crumpled up pieces of paper. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is what happens when moderately intuitive kids with no scientific skill attempt engineering.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also in third grade, I made a kickass diorama of the forest but kept forgetting to bring in animal figurines for it. I failed.

The one I made was a cylindrical Kool-aid container which was filled with water and a certain amount of salt in addition to the necessary egg.  But our drop was conducted inside the classroom and we did not have to survive two storeys.

      I bought a giant peanut-shaped sponge, carved out an egg-shaped hole in the middle, put the egg in, then taped it shut.  I then surrounded that with packing peanuts in a shoebox (we had to use a shoebox).  I won.  I was so proud I took it home and set it on my dresser.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't know eggs could rot.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
When my mom cleaned my room a couple of months later, she opened the box and picked up the sponge, confused.  The egg fell out and broke.  She promptly began vomiting in her 8 year-old's Breakfast Club trash can.
