      You know what, I've been thinking about this equation and I don't think it works that well, since it basically penalizes one for making innocuous comments that get neither chubbies nor lames. I think something like a Chubby/Lame ratio would be more appropriate, though there should be some way to factor in total comments as well. Any math majors here to construct a needlessly complicated equation?

Also, the asshole comment by "untilyouaresonude" was a quote. Search it.

      Me and this Flynn fellow are two different people. You can tell because we each harbor a very particular disdain for people like you who insist they're smarter because they like Anime and they were told by their mothers that it's okay to have been born a douche.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Honestly, I wonder for a quick minute whether you're some kind of joke that Chris Onstad is playing on all of us. I mean, he can write assholes (read: Pat's Blog), and we all know he's inventive enough to make a guy he's certain we'd all hate. Either you are just Onstad's imagination giving us a nice spanking on the ass, or you are Pat incarnate: opinionated over nothing, unwilling to keep things mellow, not at all interested in celebrating the genius that is this comic...which, unlike you, I and others actually read for personal enjoyment. The only joy you seem to get is in diluting yourself into believing anyone cares what you think. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think I'm done addressing you directly. If you're a real person, then you violate my "don't bother with internet turds" dictum that I hold myself to; if you're a joke, I don't want to persistently be the punchline.  <br/>

      Chris Onstad said that lame posts would be removed from the site with the next featureset update, so just leave it alone; the community will police out the assholes.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
He's really just one dude with a sense of undeserved entitlement, so leave him to roil in his anger. Honestly, I expected more of Achewood fans and although I'll pop into the comments from time to time, I'm mostly soured that dudes like asherdan share a common interest with me.

      See, now here's what I think. <br/> 
You obviously come from an unnaturally protective homestead, because you suddenly get a boner for this "freedom of speech" business. I'm also guessing that your parents are either divorced...or they're of the same gender and you're adopted. This would explain your outrageous sense of entitlement. <br/>

      This whole thing is stupid, but I thought I'd way in on one point: I see a lot of people not being 'mellow' here, but Asherdan is far from the first person that comes to mind. <br/>

Scroll up, read his original comment, then read the flamestorm that ensued, and try to imagine being a normal person coming across all this without any pre-conceptions. I don't think you guys realize how ridiculous you would seem.

      Ah, I see for sure why people hate you now.  After reading this whole exchange, I understand.  I'm still indifferent because I wasn't around for the thing originally, but even  <em>you</em>  have to admit that a lot of your combacks here were weak as all hell.  Grammar error point-outs?  C'mon, man.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have to say, overall, this is probably the most disappointing story I've ever followed through on.  I go through seeing all these lamed-out-of-existence comments thinking "Oh man, this guy must've douched out hardcore!  He must've been spamming ads for KKK websites or some shit!".  Then I get to the main of it and it turns out to be just another internet argument.  What a let-down. :/

      This makes me feel a little strange. 6 people so far actually lamed Onstad? Which is five more people than just Asherdan, who we expect this sort of thing from because he enjoys being a cock to strangers? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Who actually reads a webcomic enough to have an account with which to comment on the strips, and then when they see a comment by the AUTHOR, lames it? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Keep in mind that Onstad owes you nothing, people. And posting 'FIRST! OMGWTFBBQ!' is stupid, pointless, immature, and really fucking annoying for the rest of us who don't give a shit.

      i prefer the current setup that protects both your right to read the comic without comments and my right to read those available.  you are not compelled to log in to the assetbar comment system.  unregistered readers do not see any of these comments.  this way, the board can remain visible for those who want to use it while allowing you to not be bothered.

      True.  I guess it just breaks my heart a little to see people say basically "I don't see why %u2018Philippe standing on%u2019 it is funny."  Maybe I just wanted to assume all this time that all Achewood fans were basically me and not everybody on the whole internet in it's mediocre entirety.

      I wonder what effect internet forums have on those people who choose to share their creative sides with the world. I wonder how many emotionally fucked up artists, a la jackson pollock, we have already sent into downward spirals of suicidal depression by means of fourteen year-olds wearing Eagles of Death Metal T-shirts. And to top it all off Onstad chose to host a fucking forum on his own comics, for our own benefit, so that we talk and have just have a great old time being fans, and a solid chunk of what we, as an internet community, has to say is that Onstad is gay or that he sucks. That's just shit.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad I apologize for everyone who is a douche to you. You truly are beloved, and your comic is the best hands down.  <br/>

douche, why you even got to do a thing?

      I really like how people on the message board are already using Achewood-style--or I guess specifically Roast Beef-style--speech patterns in their comments: "all ___," & "and such."

      Beef is basically the archtypal geek. And what with Achewood being on the web and all, guess who reads it? I'm guessing 92-97% of Achewood's readership identifies strongly with Rost Beef. <br/>

Myself, I imagine Beef talking in sort of an impatient monotone, bereft of emotional association and wanting to get the words out as quickly as possible so he can stop talking.

      I'm thinking more like the other way around.. People who read this strip are representative, to a degree, of those who speak or think these ways.

The firefox devs know about alt text being cut off, it's a logged bug in their db, but they refuse to fix it, here's a link to one of the bugs, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149157 <br/>

Other comic sites have the same problem, people complain but they dont do anything. <br/>

      I thought it was just a bit of stubbornness, not precisely a bug, on the firefox folk's part, like bitching about how "ain't" has no place in the dictionary. Technically it's incorrect since alt text is supposed to be INSTEAD of the text when you decide not to show images, but IE started using it like the TITLE command and everyone followed suit, making it the accepted way of things.  Title-text just don't sound right when remarked upon in internet forums and whatnot though.

      actually these comics do all use title text instead of alt text, we just call it alt text. the "bug" as it's filed is that firefox cuts off long and multi-line  <em>title</em>  text in the tooltip.
