      Andy Larson's smug dad will talk down to him just like Andy talks down to Darren. Dick Larson will belittle his car, his lawn, his son's athletic prowess, his wife's weight problem, all with small, innocuous comments that eat at his confidence. He smiles and laughs heartily, but he knows he has his pride, and must get back at Dick Larson.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Darren's father thrusts his hopes on Darren to beat Andy out for the quarterbacking position and cheerleader girlfriend. If his son Darren succeeds, it means that he is superior to Dick Larson. Vindication.

      Ayn Rand's actual sexual interests are both surprisingly obvious and pedestrian and largely hypocritical. She wants an attractive, masculine man to be dominant and assume a conventional, submissive female role to. At the same time she needs to be entirely in control. If only she'd gotten into more BDSM I think she might have been able to start working some of this stuff out. <br/>

Have fun imagining that now.

      Her views on economics are essentialy BDSM transformed into the realm of political economy, theres a Lascivious delight in the suffering of the poor and the dependent who are castigated as weak or lazy. Seriously economic injustice is partly perpetuated because its just so damn fun to take part in.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sort of similar to when A.C Grayling called Thatcher's economic policy "Sado-monetarism" which is just about on the dollar.

      so the guy with the sports team fetish believes in neo-classical economics, (e.g. reganomics) despite the fact that the state of the art in science and economics theory has for several decades now moved past that point.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let me guess, you also believe that some sentient power in the universe is somehow or other concerned with the affairs of humans, and you probably believe in the oxymoronic concept of life after death.  Or is it just the reganomics fantasy that you believe in?

      i think this is the funniest achewood comic in the past couple of years. it'd be pretty good to have nice pete keep this up until teodor dies, and if teodor comes back like roast beef or todd does after death, nice pete can just find more ways to force teodor to strip and then kill him with repeated blunt trauma. in general this comic needs more "plot twists" which are actually just fatalities from mortal kombat

      Summary brought to you by aging. The new disease on the radio. <br/>

I'm confused where diseases/agencies get advertising from to let people know that lime disease is not easily detected because people don't look for it. Who funds a campaign to detect lime disease (it's not the government)? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is convincing people they have diseases and selling them prevention/treatment so lucrative that  <em>specific diseases</em>  can be targeted?

      No, sadly. A friend from college actually did this in high school, not me. He and his girlfriend and his friend and his girlfriend each took turns fucking in the trunk of the car while the other whipped it around as much as possible. This was not a person noted for his mental capability or skills in any area of life. Nevertheless he was the one who was having sex in high school.

      I don't think Teodor wants to get out.  I've been watching this Teodor, and I'm pretty sure he's one sick puppy.  We've been told previous he has repressed man love issues, and I think there has always been an implication that he's basically a  <em>bitch</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
In a just world, I think this time spent with Nice Pete is Teodor's reward for his services rendered to Phillipe.

      Not at all, this is something my friends and I do, both online and in real life.  Make a horrible joke and then either mash the keyboard to signify how you hate yourself or in real life, swipe at the air, stomp your feet, maybe fake cry, leave the room, kick something, just some ridiculous full body movement to show you hate yourself.  It adds to the humor greatly.

      Bravo. I wish I could rate strips to give this a well-deserved 5. One of my new favorites. Though I kind of wish Nice Pete had told Teodor his "high school name" was "Pete" Peter Cropes just for the added creepiness. <br/> <br/> <br/> And on the subject of violent crazy people, I have a story for you all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Last week some kid from my high school went absolutely batshit fucked crazy. He gave a crazed speech to a crowd of people after a funeral about how the several hundred people in my high school class needed to: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Get together! Unite! We,  <em>%u201908</em> , are destined to take this world and the universe!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
He then left the funeral (confusing the fuck out of a lot of grieving people) and met up with friends of mine later that night. He was acting weary and confused; everything he said was about his need to find himself and answer the questions. He seemed a complete wreck, but people attributed it to him being upset about the funeral and let it slide. He left.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
He drove up to New York that night, apparently on his quest to begin the  <em>Rise of the "Class of '08"</em> . He drove into Yonkers and stopped at a house. He stepped out of his car, rampaged into the house(which was apparently unoccupied at the time), and began destroying everything he could. Mirrors, televisions, stoves, stereos, and all he systematically destroyed and then drove away undetected into the night. He then stopped at another house several miles away. He got out of the car, broke into the house, and destroyed everything he could as quickly as he could. He fled. He approached a third house. Broke in. This time the police were nearby.  <br/> 
Two cops came to the house. This kid (who was a cokehead who spent an unexaggerated 45%  of his life in the gym during the high school years I knew him) fought the cops with everything he had. I don%u2019t know the details of the fight %u2013 only the results %u2013 but one cop was thrown out the front window and both were badly beaten in the fight. The kid was arrested and sent to a Psychiatric Ward in a New York Hospital.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That%u2019s all true. What. The. Fuck. That quote, ridiculous and elementary as it is, is word-for-word what he said after the funeral.  <br/> 
I want to know what the fuck correlation those houses had in that kid%u2019s mind and how he thought that destroying them would further his quest to take over the %u201Cworld and the universe%u201D for the glory of %u201C%u201908%u201D. How were 3 random houses in Yonkers the key to universal domination? Why was my high school class the chosen group?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I kinda want to visit the ward if I'm ever in New York just to listen to the guy. He's just lost his damn mind. <br/> <br/> <br/> Just thought I'd share.

      That's a great story.  As a person who knew some people who used to do a lot of cola, *ahem*, I can tell you that the whole story is spot on.  I can't tell you exactly what the story line was in dude's head, but it probably went something along these lines, "That house!"  "I *remember* that house!"  "So *that's* why they made me move..."  "Wait."  "What?"  "What am I supposed to do now?"  "Oh!!!"  "Got it."  "Tear the fuck out of it!"  "Right!!"   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And so forth.  The internal dialog can get "involved." <br/> 
You should go talk to him.  The poor bastard.  He's lucky those cops didn't shoot him.  See if you can put it in his head to try to get accepted at the Delancey Street Foundation up in Brewster.  At this point that is about his only hope.

      it's.  Sure, it can be a contraction, and (sorta) knowing English, I'm sure it can be a lot of other things too.  But it can also be possessive.  apostrophe "s" denotes possessiveness.  possessivity.   <br/>

dog's = that which belongs to the dog <br/> 
it's = that which belongs to it <br/>

The apostrophe has been swallowed over time, so the use of the apostrophe with pronouns is now reserved to contractions, not possessives.  Sorry. <br/>

      today someone honked at me because I changed lanes in front of him.  It was one of those situations where you come round a bend, and you turn wider than the car that was behind you, resulting in you being in the left lane, and the car behind you in the right lane.  Had you turned tighter, you both would have been in the same lane, so it would be incumbent upon the car behind you to accelerate and pass you...  Well I'm a slow driver, so by the time I'm signaling and changing back into the right lane, the car behind me is thinking about passing me on the right.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
so this car honked at me.  So I rolled down the window, and as he passed me on the left, I pointed vigorously to the back of my car, to indicate to him the turn signal concept, and I made the blink blink pantomime with my hand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
there are so many idiots out there.  It's like everyone who comments on youtube drives a car.

      What is it with people who can't complete a turn in the same lane that they started it in?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
ratacat, got a question for you: Did you signal when you made the first lane change?  No?  Didn't think so... <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Clueless fuck."  (Don't take it personally - just sharing with you what the guy who honked was thinking.)

      yeah, I signal at every lane change.  compulsively.  I sometimes make wide turns where I wind up in the adjacent lane so as to avoid slowing down while still reducing wear and tear on my suspension.  But I generally try to avoid this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
people probably often do think I'm a clueless fuck.  I usually drive around 50, not more. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At that speed, when someone starts tailgating you without immediately passing you, they're often on a cell phone.  I know this because I usually slow down to force them to pass me, and I'll see them on the cell.  I like for these people to pass me because since they're on the cell, if I have to stop for some reason, they might rear end me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
the slowest I've ever had to slow down to get someone to pass me on the interstate was around 15 MPH.  It was someone with absolutely the most incredibly bright halogen headlights I have ever seen.  So bright I was blinded by them in my rear view mirror despite having it flipped over to the 'dark' setting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think a good app for the ipad would be something with voice recognition... you put it in your back window and it flashes whatever you say to the car behind you.  But for privacy, you have to prepend it with "insult" <br/> 
 <br/> 
e.g. "insult: you fuck tard I signaled that meant I was going to turn that's why I turned why the fuck did you honk fuck you I hope you die in a car accident from being run off the road and your car crashes and catches on fire"   <br/> 
 <br/> 
and then the ipad would scroll that in a big banner across the screen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
it would also be nice if the ipad could sync up with 3 other ipads next to it for a bigger screen area.

      Man, I thought of an interactive LED bumper that would do that sort of thing years ago. <br/> 
 But just think of the extra road-rage that would bring on. People all going for miles out of their way down the wrong highway, insulting each other until one paints a graphic of a gun on his iPad with Photoshop lite. <br/> 
 The other guy pulls out a real gun because he is unfamiliar with  <em>Internets Trollery Protocols &amp; Rules of Engagement.</em> <br/>

Lyle's status as a certified asshole means he would allow Slippy to be killed by the enemy crafts following him. Ray would distract the team with shenanigans. Then in the end Cornelius would swoop in and destroy Andross without using even one smart bomb.

      Cartilage Head would be a boss in Sector X who, instead of attacking by conventional means, assaults your senses with a harrowing melody on his musical saw.  If you shoot him, the Starfox team is treated to a montage of immolating Tibetan priests, chickens being slaughtered, and pianos being smashed with sledgehammers.  The entire team ejects from their cockpits and succumbs to the vacuum of space in an effort to escape their impending madness (causing you to lose a life).  If you choose to ignore him instead, CH's song builds to a crescendo that is so powerful that all of the stars in the galaxy are drawn to his location.  The team is burned to a crisp, again causing you to lose a life.  Players who try to evade this unwinnable quandary with Gameshark awake the next morning bearing the Lash of Thanatos. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end, you're really just better off defusing the bomb on Fortuna and taking the route to Solar instead.
