      That's what I thought, but it didn't make any sense. I was hoping maybe he was replying to something else and Assetbarista screwed up so it would maybe make some sense. <br/>

Maybe it was about typing "the answer to life, the universe, and everything" into Google? That's kind of an old trick though. Still amusing.

      Oh, OK... you had me there for a minute since I had no idea that was the aspect you were referring to. In that case: no idea.

Belgand follows the law. He wants people who intentionally go a few miles over the speed limit to be dragged from their cars and beaten viciously on the side of the road. He is also a pacifist, but speeding is totally not cool.

      Being five doesn't just mean you talk like a little kid. Being five means you're remarkably egocentric, are still in the preoperational stage and can't think non-concretely (expressions like "followed them to a T", "not with this guy watchin'") and don't have a confident and fully-formed theory of mind, if they have one at all ("He thinks I said the right thing").

      I guess I will be the one to state the obvious then: Phillipe is older than 5 now.  5-year-olds do not sit down at a typewriter and hammer out a story with perfect spelling and grammar.  First they go to school for a few years - then they might do such a thing.  Only they are not 5; they are 7, 8, or 9. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Right?

      Yeah, when I was eighteen had a pretty long Everclear and Mountain Dew phase. I had no idea what I was doing. Often spent the night doubled over in the corner. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, when I was around twenty-two I once planned an entire night around Jim Beam and milk 'cause a book I had read (an actual bartender's guide, mind you) called that a "Cowboy" and said it would be OK. It was not OK.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I guess some people take longer than others to grasp certain things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
P.S. I can now, in my old age, make myself a perfect White Russian when I want to. That's about as far as I got, but it's a start. I guess my legal drinking age should have been about twenty-eight.

      Everyone else has already read Preacher. We did it at least a decade ago or so. The series ended in '00 so there have been at least eight years to read it in full.

      I find that as someone in his twenties living in a major city I have great need for irony than most people. Is "slamming" a Mountain Dew in a self-consciously "extreme" fashion likely to fulfill my daily irony needs? I'm usually qualified to assess my satirical needs, but the nearest local satirist was already busy subtly mocking another customer when I arrived and from the customer's foibles, general air of mass market consumption, and what I believe was their SUV parked out front I presumed that he would be busy for quite some time.

      We are running a huge irony deficit. It has been outsourced, ironically, to places like East Sardonica, who as we all know, craft irony with substandard controls. <br/> 
 That leaves us in a straight-faced recession of superficiality and papier-mache' demeanors. <br/> 
 Which, I might add superfluously, sucks.

      However, Philippe understands the  <strong>fuck</strong>  out of writing fiction -  <em>run</em>  at the typewriter, connect emotionally with your characters, hammer out the first and (if you have his skills) final draft, complete with edifying moral aspect; then speed away. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I love the fact that he discovers the story as it flows forth from his flippers and can be surprised and excited about the various plot twists. The old chestnut about fictional characters taking on a life of their own as they're being written... <br/>

      I would disagree with you by claiming the exact opposite is true. I suspect that there will never be any agreement here, however. <br/>

This is one of the persistent cultural wars in America. I will be happy as long as we can agree to split up into Blue and Red America at least. I can maybe learn to live with the pro-sports types as long as they don't make it too much of a big deal and avoid spending my taxes on new amazingly expensive stadiums.

      I don't like much more than baseball but I can't see why people hate sports with a blazing passion.  It's just there; dumb people watch it, sure, but it surely doesn't make the list of Worst Things Ever.

      The great thing about following spectator sports is that if you pick the right teams, you can guarantee a lifetime of disappointment, ensuring that the external universe matches exactly your expectations.  Getting emotionally invested in, and perpetually disappointed and enraged by my various favorite teams has done wonders to make me the bitter, cynical person I am.  I never have to worry about the emptiness that accompanies a success you did nothing to earn. <br/>

Plus, some sports are fun to play.  It's certainly more amusing that going to a gym.

      I am afraid of skiing. The lifts just plain frighten me. I'm not a afraid of heights, but I am very afraid of falling. I try to avoid putting myself in any sort of precarious position where falling might be more likely. Sort of like how I vigilantly worry about having glasses too close to the edge of tables or anything placed in a position where it might be knocked over or fall off or that if the lid is not on the toilet  <em>at all times</em>  things will almost certainly fall in there. I do not understand for a moment people who would leave the lid up. They scare me a little bit too. It just seems dirty not to close it as well.

      I've noticed that Americans have this association, which is unfortunate. Basically, where I was born, almost everyone learned to ski from age five, and you didn't have to go to a resort, since there was plenty of snow on the hill behind the elementary school from November to April. There were also great forest paths for cross country. I also used to know how to ice skate, since the lake was frozen solid every year, but I'm afraid I've mostly forgotten.

      Eww... that new 4th Ed. crap where they decided to basically totally fuck up decking by making everything wireless? I mean, yeah, I see the idea, but they really just did it because they're dicks who hate decking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Man, why did every decent RPG company have to fold (White Wolf doesn't count, see "decent" above)? TSR got bought up by WotC who, as predicted, completely destroyed D&D. Fasa died out and various people scavenged up the corpse and often fucked up their properties (though from what I hear the new Battletech is actually pretty boss). West End Games folded and we ended up with another weird new version of Paranoia that apparently isn't very good and WotC bought out the Star Wars license. Palladium just kept on being completely crazy more or less all the damn time and releasing more and more Rifts supplements that totally overpower all the previous ones and reprint a lot of material (but never a 2nd edition even when it's desperately needed). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess you could say that Chaosium and Steve Jackson Games are still some of the only old-school companies still around and still producing the games that made them famous. A real shame.

      I avoiding playing it, but I was playing AD&D when the setting came out and I was also subscribing to Dragon at the time so I read a lot about it. It wasn't until I played (and I still really need to finish) Planescape: Torment that I started to regret never getting into it and realized that it actually had some potential. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It did, however, feel a bit too much like something that would have made a better stand-alone game than something sort of shoehorned into AD&D (unless you did a lot of planar travel; see also Spelljammer), but TSR didn't want to launch other games because they never really did well and they knew AD&D would sell.

      Very true. As a cheaply bleached blonde she just looks like, well, a cheap late-70s bleached blonde skank. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Allyson Hannigan had a similar problem when she changed her hair color, but it wasn't anywhere near as severe. Personally I think her "college" hairstyle was also far less attractive, but just about everything on the show had problems then. <br/>

In general, but not exclusively, saying that someone is significantly hotter as a redhead is like saying that the sun plans to rise tomorrow morning.

      That is, it's a popular cliche with no real relation to reality - the sun doesn't  <em>plan</em>  anything, it's a giant ball of chemicals.  For that matter, it's not rising - the Earth is just rotating to face it.

Empirical evidence seems to indicate that pale redheads are amazingly hot to the same degree that observations appear to support the claim that the Earth will rotate in such a way as to cause photons from the Sun to strike the surface at approximately 6 AM local time. I suggest further research to confirm whether this consistently happens every rotation and the relative effects at various points on the Earth.

      If you were a lady and not particularly ugly (and maybe even then, depends) you could have a pretty decent amount of sex if you were not especially picky or shy about being very forward.

      You're overlooking the fact that the whole reason there's a 'double standard' is because of this imbalance of power. A dude slut is gross, to be sure, but there's still the sense that he's achieved something difficult. If we eliminate the shame factor, the vast majority of girls would just end up boning the top 10% or so of the hottest dudes and leave the rest with nothing. <br/>

      Hmm... so you believe that shame alone is the reason why ladies are not just totally gangbanging the top 10% of dudes? I'm not so sure about that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think we also need to define the important difference between sluts and  <em>skanks</em>  before we continue. Skanks, I feel we can agree, are gross, low-class disgusting people regardless of whether they are avowed sluts or not. The crossover, however, does tend to be abnormally high to a degree that would suggest a correlative effect, but does not prove one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The way you phrase man sluts though, I think that works. It is like playing a really terrible game and getting really, really good at it. Yeah, the game is horrible and you have no taste for playing it, but you are really good and you can't ignore the skill involved.

      Dude, Link to the Past was the best Zelda game. Fuck the people who say that Ocarina of Time was better. It was not! OoT was just a terrible casualty of the problem of that generation where people suddenly decided that everything needed to be 3d - even if it would look terrible - just because the hardware could kinda barely do it. It was OK, but LttP was vastly superior. Just like Super Mario World was much better than Mario 64 where they decided to basically make it into a puzzle game rather than a platformer.

      Oh my god. I just finished that game a couple of months ago, and my verdict is that it is a tedious piece of crap. The graphics look cool for the first few minutes, maybe. The story is simplistic and the dialogue is lame. 95% of your time will be spent sailing from place to place. The other 5% will be spent fighting monsters who, even with their strongest attacks, take off no more than a quarter heart, and solving repetitive, time-consuming puzzles. Of course, it's still a Zelda game, so it was somewhat enjoyable for that reason alone, but it is definitely the worst out of the ones I've played. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I agree that Link to the Past was awesome, though I also think Ocarina was pretty great. But my favorite is the much-overlooked Majora's Mask. Better graphics than Ocarina, the darkest and most serious tone of all the Zelda games, and an awesome overall concept. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have Twilight Princess, but after the tedium of Wind Waker, I need a long rest before starting another Zelda game.

      Well, you probably just altered the course of my gaming life. I was just starting  <em>WW.</em>  I thought it seemd OK, but I was really just holding out for the moment in which it became awesome. You say that this doesn't happen, so I probably won't waste any more time on it. I need to find something, though. I only have a Gamecube so my options are pretty limited. I think I've just about wrung every drop of joy I could from  <em>Animal Crossing.</em>  Don't get me wrong - it was a hell of a lot of joy. It was a  <em>fuckload</em>  of joy. But it's time to move on. I really think it's just a matter of time until an Xbox must enter my life. Then no one will ever see me again.

I love pretty much all the Zelda games, and Wind Waker was basically my bridge into the series. I love Wind Waker. <br/>

      Weirdly enough, my two favourite Zelda games are Majora's Mask and Wind Waker. In my opinion, you're right about the combat being far too easy in WW, but if you removed that factor and stuck in some more populated islands (The one factor in which Phantom Hourglass beat it) it would basically be a Perfect game. It's just so stylised and beautiful (Partly the same reason I loved MM, really.) but yeah, it could have done with more depth and difficulty. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Majora's Mask, however, could not possibly be improved. The three-day system was purest genius, there were enough side-quests to last a lifetime, and the difficulty was pretty well balanced throughout, as well. Also, GORON LINK. And yeah, it's pretty much the quintessential Dark Zelda game. Twilight Princess can take several hikes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've never played Link to the Past though, sadly.

      Those are basically my main daily fears, yes. Also add in "anti-intellectualism in American life", but that's not so much a fear as a it is a constant source of pain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It should also be clarified that I am not afraid that ski lifts  <em>exist</em> . I have no problem looking at them. I'm just afraid to go on them. Sort of the same with toilet lids. I find it disgusting and I'm afraid that something will fall in. Perhaps afraid is too strong, very concerned might be more appropriate.

In the interest of helping our Assetbar Philippe, I'm going to make a generalization: Sje - a fairly smart and quirky non-douchebag guy like you who decides to only like tan blonde girls is basically setting himself up for a lifetime of disappointment. If you really insist on your preference, I suggest you make some drastic changes in your life.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101104/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97CtEReZEaQ">These</a>  are the guys that tan blonde girls like.

      I'm not a fan of tattoos either. I've seen some cool ones, but ultimately I do not think that you ought to be putting permanent markings on your skin or piercing it. Sadly the types of girls I often like seem to think that this is a rather boss idea. It is a dilemma.

      I'm not THAT into tans, guys.  They are okay.  Generally they improve the looks, but not always.  And I'm not THAT into blonds either.  I love brunettes too.  And some red heads are really pretty too, but usually not . . .I don't know.  Sometimes certain hair colors just look better to me. <br/> 
Also: <br/> 
I do hate tatts, and I hate big boobs too.  I hate them incredibly much, and I think a lot of porn stars are ugaly and mostly unattractive.  Well, often attractive, but not something I normally fantasize about.  I'd rather have more of a girl-next-door kind of chick, with morals and personality and what not.  And cuteness over hotness (blond hair is cuter).  I would be totally willing to fall for a girl with brown hair. <br/>

      Cute is definitely better than "hot" but that's also generally a factor in the type of douchebags describing someone as "hot". <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personality is also important, but morals... hmm... I think that's a touchy area. I rarely think "I want a girl with MORALS!" so much as "I want a girl who will want to engage in all the perverse things I think would be fun basically all the time and who will be the one to suggest them in the first place. She will be a fun classy slut in public as well as in the bedroom because who wants some virginal lady who acts like she can't possibly enjoy a good necropederasty joke?". When you say you want a girl with morals it usually implies that you want someone who is, hmm... very religious perhaps? That sort of person.

      Oh . . .not religious. Not that I wouldn't date a religious person or anything; it's just a thing I don't really want.  By morals I guess I mean a girl who is kind, doesn't offend people, doesn't steal, swear too much (my sisters swear way too much for the shock value . .. I hate that) and is .. . well .. . .it's more of her attitude towards the word I guess.  If she doesn't live to be overly rebelious to assert herself or to just always challenge people, or doesn't care about her future or her body . .. you know.  That is what I meant.

      It is, however, not possible to swear too much. Frankly, I don't understand people who make any sort of distinction. Words are words and all, in my mind, are equal and deserving of use. Even weirder is when it's factored into ratings of films or such usually "to prevent children from hearing these words that scare me so" without any regard for the fact that the same children already know and use these words on a regular basis. <br/>

      I'm just saying that it's a bad personality trait to try to offend people just to offend them.  My sister says the most horrible, racist, sexual things.  Out loud.  With relatives around.  With a certain relish.  It's horrible.  I don't care if people swear, but it does get really annoying really fast if they are doing it for the wrong reasons.

      Depending on how she does it I might laugh and encourage her. Some people do do that sort of thing for the wrong reasons and take it from being fun and amusing to just being crass and cheap. Kind of like the difference between the Simpsons and Family Guy.

      sje, i think i'm starting to understand why you don't like tats-- you think they indicate trashiness and lack of morals. i will agree that in many cases this is true, but tats are ironic now, and lots of nerd girls get them too, not that nerd girls can't also be trashy, but usually they're not.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
also, belgand seems not to understand what you mean by morals being desirable, but i think i do. like.. maybe a chick who hasn't banged a whole bunch of dudes, or will flash her tits in public? <br/> 
 <br/> 
i remember being at a stupid music festival (one that was more about getting drunk and high than the music itself), and one chick from our group was riding on her bfs shoulder during a set(performance?). the crowd was huge, there were so many people all around us, and at that moment, someone else from our group shouts out "hey ashley, show your tits!", and to my surprise, she DID. i'll never forget how they looked. tan and somewhat underdeveloped, a few veins barely perceptible, slightly jiggling as she forcibly made them, and areolas that protruded from the main breast itself, creating smaller mounds all their own. everyone in the group, not to mention audience, thought it was awesome. her bf, far from objecting, seemed proud. later, she and another gf of a dude from our group flashed some guys at a pronto pup stand for free pronto pups. and the dudes were all trying to get me to do it too, and i was like "no, i don't want any" and they were all "i know, get us some" and i was just thinking "FUCK YOU WHY AM I EVEN HANGING OUT WITH YOU I HATE YOU PEOPLE SO MUCH" but i didn't want to say anything because i didn't want to insult the chicks in our group for being huge sluts. afterwards i was wondering if this made me a prude, but i realized that i didn't do it because i didn't feel that anyone there  <em>deserved</em>  to see my boobies. eventually i stopped doing things with the popular crowd.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i also take the number of guys i've um.. you know, done it with, pretty seriously, just because i tend to find long term relationships more fulfilling and don't want to give any random guy the satisfaction of getting in my pants. so considering that I've only been in one serious long term relationship, my number is.. less than two. i like to think of my first as 0.5, becuase it was one time, and it was just because i watched this movie "Girl"(great movie btw) and it said the average age girls lose their virginity is 16, and as i was 16, i decided i might as well get it out of the way before the deadline. after that once, i didn't do it for another like 2.5 years. shit, this is getting really personal.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
but i think morals are pretty important. most girls at my school, and i'm at a really intellectual college, think that the hottest thing is to go to europe and have lots of guilt-free sex with attractive foriegn men you'll never see again. they think that's artistic or something. but that's not appealing to me at all. it just sounds gross, perhaps even awkward. i mean, people always assume i'm kinda slutty because i guess i'm uh.. "hot" and i have tattoos and sometimes dyed-red hair and i'm generally loud and make lots of abortion and rape jokes, but no.. i'm actually pretty "principled". belgand seems to think a girl with "morals" will be religious and boring. hopefully i've demonstrated that this is not true.

      The tits flashing thing, I hate it.  On my girl's 21st we all went out drinking.  I was in the bathroom trying not to kick down the bathroom stall, becuase she had just slapped me on the ear.  Unprovoked, just *wham* I can't hear or keep my balance.  Anyway I come out and everyone hushes up, "What the fuck guys?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh I was just going to flash the bartender for free drinks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am not happy with this news, but it is her birthday and I am not going to be a prick about it.  "hell as long as I get to see them, and I get a drink too." <br/> 
 <br/> 
She does it three or four more times, gets some dude to agree to take body shots off her (i told him to fuck off and if i saw him talking to her again i'd fuck him with a tequila bottle) and is basically just a loud annoying whore.  She gets her bra stapled to the ceiling, right next to another of my X's, and god dammit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Morals are not a bad thing to have.  Giving a shit about yourself is not a bad thing to do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Good job on not putting out all the time D.

      That tat thing. . .that's part of it, but even if a girl totally wasn't trashy, I don't want tattoos on her.  I just really don't like how they look. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I must say I hate sex.  A lot.  I also hate making out, and holding hands, etc.  I never done any of those things, which may be the reason why I hate them.  A big part of why I hate these things is because it's attention-grabbing whorishness, but also jealousy is a HUGe part of it.  I hate when people have sex while I can't find a girl to kiss.  And it annoys me when people are like "sex is not bad, sex is a beautiful, natural thing" as an excuse to have orgies.  Typically the type of people who say this are 55 year old men who post on webcomic discussion boards.  I do not see how sex is beautiful . .. it probably feels good, but there is a lot of guilt and juices involved, and no, it is not beautiful at all.  Neither are nipples or vajajays.  The whole thing is very gross, actually.  What is nice are girls wearing bikinis, but even that is sometimes too naughty for me, because it reminds me too much of sex. <br/> 
I mean pretty much what I want the most is to not to be different, and to want affection.  So that I won't be different, I want a girlfriend and sex.  For affection I want . . .a girlfriend.  Either way that girl you hang out with is a slut.  I was flashed one(1) time, at my house, when my brother goaded his friend to show me.  I remember no nipples on her.  I don't know if it is because she had very wide and pale ones or if I experienced a localized, temporary blindness.   <br/> 
I dig that you don't show guys your goods.  Pretty much all I want is a girl who doesn't alienate me with her morality.  You seem like a pretty cool chick.   <br/> 
A moral girl can make a lot of abortion and rape jokes.  I do and I bet I am the most morally principled one here (I don't even swear).

      Your lack of swearing may not be a moral decision, if it is something you do without reason, it is part of your character but has pretty much been formed by your morals.  There is a reason though, you don't swear because you don't swear.  If you did swear then you'd probably feel bad. <br/>

      Sje, a lot of people are going to think you're really weird for saying all this. But for what it's worth, I understand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've come to believe that all deeply-held moral beliefs are manifestations of the ways that people deal with their own cognitive dissonance and the internal contradictions inherent from the very moment you first begin to form your identity. This is not to discount morals as invalid - it's just being honest about how they're formed. That you are aware of and acknowledge this about yourself already puts you way ahead of 95% of the population. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, your view of sex pretty much mirrors my own. But while you acknowledge that, on some level, you do actually want the very things you claim are disgusting, your self-repression is still strong enough that you can convince yourself that these things  <em>are</em>  actually disgusting. I, on the other hand, am too far gone in my perversions to be able to believe this. Or rather, the word disgusting has lost some of its meaning to me, as I want these things, and consume them whenever I can, regardless of what I morally think of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So basically, I think I am more okay with being a moral hypocrite and keeping the forbidden desires fully within my conscious mind, whereas you, for the sake of moral and logical consistency, have partially submerged the conflict in your subconscious. Maybe I'm wrong, and you actually are a more pure person than I am. But I think it's also very likely that as time goes on, you will be less and less able to suppress these 'disgusting' desires, and if you continue to suppress them even harder, they will manifest in other, weirder ways (see any of Freud's case studies). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do think that the people who claim that sex is no big deal or that it's just a natural, guilt-free thing are blind to an entire moral/aesthetic dimension of life, and the entire body of art and literature dealing with the subject contradicts them (I would particularly recommend Tolstoy's  <em>The Kreutzer Sonata</em>  to you). But on the other hand, they are happier and less conflicted. Can I say that this is better or worse overall? Or do I just get some deep aesthetic satisfaction out of being tortured and conflicted? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know what my point is, but I just wanted to let you know that you are not that weird and give you some things to think about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, none of this means you are gay, unless I am gay as well, and I think it would have manifested in some way by this point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do think that you are mistaking some of the superficial indicators of morality (swearing, tattoos, etc.) with actual morals, as Daedala pointed out. But that's the kind of thing that can only change with time and exposure. We still think you are rad.

      Thank you.  We really live in a sex dominated society . . .or at least college is a lot more sex-oriented than other realms of life.  And assetbar . ..  a lot of people here have a lot of sex, and I get jealous.  I'm not imposing my morality .. .I'm just saying I get very uncomfortable.  And I'm glad you understand that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do think that sex is dusgusting, but I get the feeling you think that I am abstaining from it or something.  I would have sex, I think, if I had a viable chance.  I want it very badly, in fact, but I am also disgusted by sex because of the juices, mostly.  I mean, I do look at too much porn.,  It is disgusting, and I think I would still be disgusted even if I was getting some.  So I'm not really sure I'm repressing anything.  My dissonance about sex is front and center, where I love watching people do it, I want to do it, but I hate hearing people talk about it.  It makes a man go mad. And I'm still not really sure even sluttiness is immoral, if it's not harming anyone .. .but I still feel as if it is immoral.  And with the swearing. .. I don't care if other people swear.  I don't think swearing, in itself, is immoral, unless you  are trying to offend or swear way too much or something.  Basically what it is is that I have not sworn in 19 years, so I won't now.  I don't want to break the streak, I suppose.  If I did, I would feel bad.  I find solace, I guess in not swearing.  So maybe it is not a moral or anything, but it is still a principal, I guess.  And the things with tats is only an aesthetic thing.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
So pretty much what I'm saying is that I'm not really talking about morals, but my feelings towards things and heavy cognitive dissonance.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thank you, it is highly probable I will read that book, because I want to get into Russian Literature more.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If we want to have sex with naked women, we are not gay.  I don't care what Freud or zapatos has to say.   <br/>

Thanks dude.

Okay, you're right, I did have a misconception and now you've clarified it. That is pretty much exactly how I feel.

      speaking of people having sex making us uncomfortable, perhaps you are fortunate enough that college hasn't forced other people's sex-having sounds upon your unsuspecting ears, but i suffer this on an at least weekly basis. one of my roommates has his gf over all the time, and our apt is really small so when they do it, everyone hears. i heard them just now. i've gotten to the point where it only makes me uncomfortable when i overhear people who are attractive, because only then might i actually get aroused. my roommate and his lady do nothing for me, so i just regard their sounds as if i were overhearing flatulence-- unpleasant but not too distracting. i still think it's rude though. like they should really wait to do it when nobody's home. i try to be obnoxious about it, like when they come out i'll be like "hey was that GOOD SEX?? because it sounded pretty LAME." and she'll get embarrassed and just not say anything and he'll say "ok, we get it" but uh, no, they don't get it. assholes.

      I haven't experienced it myself, but I heard stories.  If my roommate was with a girl, I would tell him to leave, and if he didn't, I would punch him mid-coitus.

      man the kid wants to do it. just be glad it comes so easily to you. i mean, it comes really easily to me too, just due to being a mildly attractive girl, but it makes me sad that someone who wants to hold hands and have kisses has never gotten to. cuz all those things are really nice, and sex is too. i'm pretty sure sje would realize that sex isn't so disgusting once he actually does it. it can be playful, it can be cute, and it can be totally nasty, but it doesn't have to be. i'm just soft-hearted, i guess. once i got really annoyed at this bullfrog making loud sounds in our backyard and i told my mom i wanted to go out there, find the little jerk and pop his throat bubble so he'd shut the hell up, and my mom was like "it's probably calling for a mate, but it's all alone out there" and i started thinking about how the bullfrog will never find a bullfrog lady and how its entire life will probably be spent in our backyard, all alone, and i got so sad i started crying. i thought about finding it and taking it somewhere where there'd be other bullfrogs, but i had no idea where that would be, which made me cry harder. this was like 2 years ago, haha. not that sje is a bullfrog, but ya know. he'll get a lady friend if i can help it! i'm not sure how i'd help.. but i think self esteem is probably the place to start. sje, you are rad. you hear me? YOU. ARE. RAD!

      It could be something really specific that I'm missing, but basically I believe that Tekende is likening your internet "game" to that of a famously effeminent pop star. <br/>

Also, "Not to embarrass you, but I would probably faint if I [held your hand]" is a sentiment basically at the heart of, like, 75% of songs by The Smiths. I mean, it basically could be a Morrissey lyric.

      I have no problem with any of these things. I also have no problem with people who choose not to do them for reasons that are sensible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The important thing is the manner in which they are done. There is definitely a fun, sexy way to flash people and a cheap, low, crass way to do it as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's nothing wrong with having a lot of casual, foreign or even domestic sex, but don't try to pretend that it's artistic or special. It's because you would enjoy having a lot of sex. If you're that concerned with justifying it then, yeah, you shouldn't be doing it.

      I'm not offended for myself, necessarily.  But to hate on women who happen to be tan is just ridiculous, and to act like your taste in physical appearances is the One True Path is insane.  If you like a certain type, that is perfectly fine.  Just don't act like people who don't fit that "look" are disgusting or some sort of monstrous subhuman. <br/>

      I feel like you're telling me that I'm not allowed to express an opinion. I'm not saying we need to have camps for really tan people, I'm just saying it's not a look I like. I find it odd that other people would be into that. I find it odd that much of popular culture pushes it as  <em>the</em>  desirable look. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If anything our popular culture is the one guilty of saying that people are subhuman. How often are people described as being pale in a negative light? That being tan means you are healthy and good? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will reserve the right to hate on people with brittle, straw-like hair and viciously orangey skin in the middle of winter in a place where it is cold during that time. I think that is something we can all agree on.

      Yeah, I mean, my girlfriend is naturally blonde (though she's been losing it lately and he hair has started to turn more brown) and I have no problem with that. It is actually somewhat interesting to me as, if I only went by my stated preferences she would not necessarily fit in such a rigid definition, but that doesn't matter. It's never been an issue. <br/>

The point, I guess, is that love knows all kinds and you can find that, in reality, your choices don't always conform to what you think they might.

      No, if they start getting tans then I'm turned off, but otherwise the fit within the limits of what I generally like. <br/>

I guess it's also fundamentally just something I can't explain. It's a personal preference. <br/>

      The cord is coming from the bottom of the control. <br/>

IMO Sonic has been bunk since the Genesis days, but I've heard that the RPG is actually really awesome. I'm not a huge RPG fan but I've played most of the Mario ones and it's made in the same vein.

      Actually, I have read exclusively bad reviews about the Sonic RPG. <br/>

And yeah, if the cord is coming from the bottom it's a Dreamcast. After seeing this is becomes more obvious that it's in roughly a Dreamcasty shape.

      Bioware made Baldur's Gate which was instrumental in bringing back RPGs from being a dying genre in the mid to late 90s to being a pretty popular one. They are not just people who made KOTOR (which you damn well better play on the PC and not the fucking XBox! Fuck the damn XBox, it's ruining PC gaming!). <br/>

I may need to check reviews again, but it was doing badly last time I checked. <br/>

... <br/>

According to GameRankings it currently has an aggregate of 74% with most sites giving it a 6 or 6.5. That is terrible given the current system of ratings inflation. Almost nothing worth playing ever scores below an 8 or maybe a 7.5.

      That's a terrible and obvious joke. If I was grading your project I'd probably mark it down just for trying to pull something like that. Maybe only a percentage point, but it would definitely be a negative. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It just smacks of "I think this is so clever", but without really being clever. Like when someone says "That's what she said!" because we all know how obvious and not at all clever that really is. It is pained. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not trying to be a dick here, but I would strongly urge you to amend that.

      Well, the joke is one character is a private investigator/college student ala Veronica Mars (oh I'm sure every single fucking person on this site has heard about VM already and probably knew about it 1000 years before I found it...) and he offers his services as a PI to his friend for 50 bucks plus expenses, to much the friend says "That's what I get for having a dick for a friend", the PI character corrects her and she rebuts with "I'm not talking about your hobby."

      I'm guessing the PI character says something along the lines of "Actually, I'm a private investigator." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suggest making a running gag where someone later goes: <br/>

Character A: "People are dying, and meanwhile, you're just hanging around, playing with your dick." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Character B: "That's just vulgar." <br/>

      True, but I was willing to accede a bit for convenience's sake. Times have moved on a bit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, why do people still say "samurai sword"? Has "katana" not reached significant enough penetration (this would be correct, it is a slashing weapon)? Are people concerned that they might be accidentally misidentifying a wakizashi, kodachi, or tachi? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not trying to be a dick to you personally, I just never understood that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you were really hardcore you'd do it old school style and shoot them with an arrow while on horseback. I'd also be willing to give style points to anyone willing to bring it with a naginata even if that does tend to be more associated with the ladies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The naginata totally gets made fun of by the other polearms. The Bec de Corbin, Voulge-Guisarme, and Guandao all got together and formed a clique to exclude it for being totally girly. They don't listen when it claims to have been popular with totally badass warrior-monks.

      There is good historical evidence that there may not even have  <em>been</em>  dedicated ninja swords. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To anyone considering Kendo out there it is a great way to get terrible blisters on your feet and have stern Japanese men tell you how you are doing everything wrong all the time. It is really hard. Much harder than karate. When you finally do get it right though it is still not quite as cool as maybe it could be due to being contorted into a sport. It is also very expensive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The dudes at www.nyjedi.com seem to be doing something fairly awesome though. I might be able to get behind that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I might just go back to kendo though. It is seriously crazy hard though.

      I'm just saying that some people are trying to make it into a sport. You are still learning essential skills on how to make a person better acquainted with their internal organs. It is only a sport when you allow it to be treated like a sport. Dude got to know where to draw the line is what I'm saying.

      Hmm... that does seem to be a fairly accurate take on my personality most of the time. Assetbar does not often allow my natural humor and casually joking nature to shine through so much as it does my nature of being strongly opinionated on everything with a fairly fierce pedantic streak. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I shall try to restrict myself more closely to joking and lessen the degree of schooling people who are Wrong.

      Maybe I have been coming off as a bit stronger and angrier than I really am. Much of my anger is comically overstated. I tend to express myself a bit in extremes and I can see how that might not work out very well when the inherent "I disagree, but I am taking it to ludicrous levels for both emphasis and comedic value" is not as easily displayed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
With regards to the production logos thing I wasn't really angry so much as I thought we were going to be doing a Thing, but then people started just bringing up newer logos and not classic ones from my childhood. It was just so not what I thought was going to be going on and felt much less interesting. Still, I was not really upset about it. I thought the gif appropriately encapsulated the level of feeling (i.e. nobody is that serious about enforcing silly hat rules... it is humorously over the top). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I did not see that I was supposedly being more strident than any others, but I shall nevertheless apologize. I do not wish to be a jerk.

      As someone who likes The Cure but not Rocky Horror, I'm not so sure about that. The Cure is just good music that is at times a little silly but overall can be appreciated directly. Rocky Horror seems like one of those things that you have to approach with several layers of self-conscious irony/character-playing. Boo to that.

      Hmm... you can appreciate it almost directly, but yeah, not entirely directly. You have to at least appreciate it for being campy and intentionally over-the-top. You don't need to take it to the full in-theater floor show and callbacks level though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It also helps if you appreciate Tim Curry. <br/>

Let's just all agree to instead appreciate the movie Clue because it was pretty damn awesome.

      I appreciate Tim Curry big time. But I also genuinely loved some of the songs from  <em>Rocky Horror.</em>  I mean, "Science Fiction/Double Feature" basically  <em>is</em>  T. Rex. Yeah, it's campy as hell, but it also very tangibly touches on a very glam vibe, and I've always had a weak spot for that sort of thing.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And just to get this out there - I was  <em>never</em>  one of the dress-up-and-go-to-the-art-theater-at-midnight-to-shout-dialog-at-the-screen types. I mean, I have nothing against that, but I didn't want you to think that this was coming from one of them. I thought it'd cheapen it.

      I could appreciate both sides of it. It seems that not everyone can do that. I remember going with a friend who couldn't stand it in the theater because he thought they were ruining it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm the type of person who enjoys shouting obscenities in public for no adequately explored reason and seeks to do so basically whenever possible (I do not require the assistance of alcohol for this either) so it appeals to me for that reason. At the same time, yeah, it's glam as hell and has some legitimately fun songs if you can appreciate their camp awesomeness. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's also a film that is fundamentally about getting the stick out of your ass and being able to enjoy camp and socially-acceptable vaguely kinky sex. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is also about how a change of filter can make your oral sex seem exciting and new.

      No, not so much angrily as in a fun, jovial way. Such as you are playing trivia at the bar as you do every week. As answers must often be shouted a little bit in order to be heard you sometimes also shout various other jokes and rudeness such as is fitting. Everybody laughs. Is good time for all.

      I think what achilleselbow meant (forgive me if I'm putting words in your mouth here, mr. elbow) is not that an abortion or a miscarriage isn't a grave event, but more that just because a story includes such an event, that doesn't automatically make it "the best short story ever written."

      Kinda. I think mostly what I meant was that the surrounding story is so easy to instantly figure out that there's nothing really evocative or mysterious about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Donald Barthelme had a pretty famous essay about "perfect sentences" which tell a story in and of themselves. I think this might have been included, but the other examples were infinitely better. For example: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Leopards break into the temple and drink to the dregs what is in the sacrificial pitchers; this is repeated over and over again; finally it can be calculated in advance, and it becomes part of the ceremony." <br/>

      Far be it for I to be the female perspective here.. or the historian for that fact:  but here we are.  I speak from understanding, and not from actual experience in these matters.  This is in response to Achilles and SJEs comments: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Achilles: <br/>
Okay, so the lady had an abortion or a miscarriage. Big whoop. <br/>

SJE:miscarriage usually isn't a grave event. Technically (and I'm speaking Science here), half of all pregnancies end in abortions. But I guess that the zygote usually doesn't stick to the uteral (word?) wall. </em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
A: Losing a baby, be it intentional or unintentional, is a huge blow to a woman's psyche.  Often it results in lifelong feelings of inadequacy, especially if she's unable to have a child after said event.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
B: Previous to todays fantastic, overobsessive health care (ya know, Hemingways time period), many many pregnancies resulted in "miscarriage" - perhaps some of them being intentional.  If a woman aborted a baby, she was generally socially shunned if her peers learned of it. Abortions were not that common, or not spoken about if they did happen- in fact, they were illegal and often quite risky to the womans health. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So basically what I'm trying to say is that abortions and miscarriage are big whoops.  In Hemingways timeframe, (and I haven't read the story you all are referring to) these would be extremely taboo subjects.

I would not respect anyone who would date her. It's a good thing I've always been sort of on the line about Brad Pitt.

      <strong>Asian Man Has Thing For Asian Women</strong> <br/> 
May 2, 2001 <br/> 
TOKYO%u2013Shoji Furukawa, a 33-year-old Tokyo man, confessed Monday to a fetish for Asian women. "For some reason, as long as I can remember, I've always been into Asian chicks," Furukawa said. "I don't know what it is about them, but they just totally do it for me." Furukawa said the preference may be a familial trait, noting, "My dad was really into Asian girls, too." <br/>

      Okay, while what you are saying is strictly correct,the type of spontaneous abortion you are describing occurs within 72 hours of conception, so that the woman would not even know she was pregnant.  Miscarriage as most people think of it is a physically significant and possibly traumatic event.

      C'mon, 'some women will be happy with miscarriages', what is a situation where a woman is going to be happy about that?  I can pretty much assure you that if a woman is aware of her miscarriage (that is to say, the fetus is far enough into development for there to be noticeable hemorrhaging) she is definitely going to be unhappy.  At least with the pain, and probably with the fact that she just lost a baby, too.  If she didn't want the child, she would've gotten an abortion, not waited for nature to may or may not take its course. Is this something men just can't really relate to?

      Oookay, see, the thing is, maybe some people might be ambivalent towards having a child, so that finding out they are not having one would be somewhat of a relief to them.  I mean, I would buy that, where it not for the fact that miscarriages are supposed to be such physically damaging events that I find it hard to imagine someone actually feeling alright about it afterwards.  At best, they would have mixed feelings about losing the baby.  Your uterus wouldn't let you just shrug off all that wasted effort!

      Most people are Christians.  Some people are different denominations, and some believe in hell, some don't, and some thinking a fetus is life and some not.  Either way, if someone truly believed in hell, they wouldn't have had an abortion.  They'd just wish really hard for a miscarriage.  I'm sure not everyone who believes that abortion is wrong and is punishable by hell actually wants to have a baby.  Some well go through the few minutes or hours of physical pain (I don't know how long the pain from a miscarriage lasts) rather than 9 months of carrying it, and then the pain of childbirth, and then at least 18 years of labor and stress to raise it.   <br/>

      Unitarians support your right to do just about everything. Episcopalians basically support your right to do most things as long as there's coffee afterwards. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My parents were Episcopal. It's basically Catholicism without the religion. It's the American branch of the Church of England. The correct stereotype would be to classify it as very WASPy. One joke states that they believe they are the only ones god trusts enough to take summers off. This is largely true. My parent's church takes (or at least, used to) a very relaxed attitude towards services in the summer and more casual attire is acceptable during the summer months. In the fall services are over in time for football. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is basically very simple to switch to atheism. You just stop attending church.

      I also meant specifically in regards to the Episcopal church. I have heard stories from friends about how hard it was for them to leave the church and such. I don't think I've ever heard another Episcopalian say that. Not to disparage the denomination too much, but it really is very liberal most of the time.

      For example the priest was divorced and had a child. The assistant pastor was female. None of this was even remotely controversial.

      <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Either way, if someone truly believed in hell, they wouldn't have had an abortion.</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I spent most of my life thinking this, the idea being that if someone actually believes in religion, the only sensible thing is to be a hardcore fundamentalist. I mean if you actually believed that you could suffer for all eternity, wouldn't you take every step to avoid it? <br/> 
 <br/> 
But people's minds don't work that way, which is to say that there are always huge gaps between what we subconsciously believe, what we consciously state we believe, what we  <em>think</em>  we believe, and what we actually do. For example, I logically believe that I am far behind on my work and will suffer grave consequences for it, yet I am still on assetbar instead of doing it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was talking to a Christian friend about this, asking him if he actually believes there's a hell, and that people who don't believe in Christ will go there. His reply was "I believe that for myself, but I don't feel comfortable believing it for others." It is easy to dismiss this as completely illogical, which it is (it also violates the Kantian principle). But I would say deep down everyone can find some contradictory beliefs like this - it's just that religion is much more obvious. For example, I have some weird views about sex that I still haven't fully worked through. It's like there's a mental wall that goes up when you try to analyze something, and at the same time you're thinking a thought, another part of you is contradicting it, and this goes on in an endless back-and-forth. Most people don't have the time or the energy for this kind of process, so they just decide to stop it at either one or the other point and wall it off so that the rest of their mind can function normally - that's called compartmentalization. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I think everyone should stop piling on you with their moral outrage. There are 6 billion people on earth and billions more who have lived throughout history. Considering the weird shit you read on the news every day, I'm sure that there has been at least ONE case out of all of those where a woman for SOME reason was happy to have a miscarriage. Can we move the fuck on now?

      Thank you.  Yeah, you make a good point about contradictory ideas . .. I always sorta thought this too.  I always thought that there is no way that creationists really believe what they claim to believe; they just want to believe it, like how I was with Santa.  But now I do actually think most of them (the really religious ones) do believe it.  I don't know. <br/> 
Thank you for that last paragraph.  That was really all I was trying to say.  We should move on. <br/>

That weird view on sex stuff.  I wonder what that is?  Because I have some weird views on it that I haven't worked through either.  More like weird attitudes, actually.

      Don't think too hard about it because sex itself is pretty weird and disgusting when you get down to it. <br/>

      Also, how disgusting is kissing? It is  <em>so</em>  disgusting. It is amazingly freaky and weird. I curse society for instilling it in us to desire to do so. <br/>

      I have skipped class a few times to have sex. I had to lie to her that I did not have class then because otherwise she would not have been into it. That is not the way one is normally expected to lie to women in order to have sex, but it was still not awesome. I should get credit for choosing her over class, not be castigated by the occasional lapse. It's not like I would skip something important.

      Many Americans are Christian (or, at least, think of themselves as such), but Americans do not make up the majority of the world. <br/>

According to the first site I found on Google Christianity is #1 at 2.1 billion adherents followed by Islam with 1.5 billion and atheism with 1.1 billion. There are also apparently more Rastafarians (600 thousand) than Scientologists (500 thousand). This is probably a good thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would also contend that perhaps the LDS are not entirely Christian as they seem to have splintered off pretty hard and added quite a bit more to the canon. They are playing with an expansion set and everyone else is still just using the main rules (Islam has added an entirely new campaign setting and Judaism is still playing First Edition).

      I wasn't even going to discuss religion.  I wasn't going to make a claim about if a certain religion is right or wrong or ethical or not.  All I'm trying to say is what Elbox said.  there has to be at least one woman who was glad she had an abortion.  THATS ABOUT IT.  It's just that whenever anyone even mentions anything relating to abortion or anything feminists jump down your throat even though you agree with 99% of what believe.  All I was saying is that not all women are devastated by a miscarriage.  That is a generalization that is not true.  Maybe 95% are.  Maybe 99.99% are.

      You basically said throughout most of this thread that some or most women would be ok with a miscarriage because they would not be having a baby, without really giving much thought to the other side of the coin, or even to the fact that there could be females  <em>on this very forum</em>  who could have suffered through a miscarriage. I have a friend who had two and it  <em>ruined</em>  her.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I understand what you were trying to say but I think you went about it in a very hamfisted sort of way.

      You didn't understand me at all! <br/> 
ARG <br/> 
That is  <em>not</em>  what I said.  I said most would not be okay.  I thought I made this clear.  I did say that would not be having a baby; in fact, I made no claims at all whether a fetus is a baby that deserves to live.  Look closer.  Please.   <br/> 
I said that people suffer through miscarriage.  I acknowledged this.  All that I'm saying is that it is not necessarily true that a woman actually suffers through a miscarriage, and that a woman could welcome it.  Not that most will; most definitely will NOT. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have not said anything offensive, really.  If someone here had one, I feel bad for her.  I'm sure it is devastating to most people.  Some people, however, are terrible people, and don't grieve when they have a miscarriage.  Some people don't care when their own parents die.  Whether a fetus is a person or not is irrelevant to the discussion.   <br/> 
Please, try to understand me.  I'm not trying to say anything offensive.

      I understand, for sure, and I agree.  There are some pretty bad people in the world, who don't care about all manner of things.  It's definitely possible that some woman, in the history of pregnancy, was happy with her miscarriage.  I'm just not sure why you brought that up in this discussion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some things we just have to accept as general truths, you know?  You don't always have to introduce the contrary point of view.  You're not wrong, it just didn't wasn't...necessary? <br/>

      I wasn't trying to make a point.  It was just a comment I said, a throwaway comment like 70% of them.  I guess I just don't like blanky statements.  Or something.  I dunno.  It definitely shouldn't have evolved into this huge thread. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, I'm sure that it's more than one woman who was happy with it.  Definitely more than that. <br/>

      Involuntary abortion?  You mean someone like ties her down and just aborts her with a clothes hanger? <br/> 
If you mean what I think you're saying, an involuntary abortion is synonymous with miscarriage. <br/> 
And yes, if someone truly believes that it is wrong to have an abortion but wishes for the baby to die anyway is messed up in the head.  Basically that person is just trying to act in  a way to get what that person wants (no kid and no hell) at the expense of the kid's life (because the person does believe the kid has a soul, etc).  If a woman truly believes that the kid has a soul and a right to live and still has the abortion, that woman is kinda a jerk to.  Of course all of this depends on what the woman believes, not what is true.  I'm not saying abortion is wrong or right. <br/> 
Point?  I said most woman don't do this, not all.  Yes, it's effed up.

      Okay. I know you didn't intend to be callous or offensive, but that's how it always begins. <br/> 
 You must know that if you really want to seriously study psychology, you have to start becoming aware of your own thought-processing, inner dialog, that stuff that bubbles up, on and on, how much of it is subconscious imprinting, etc. <br/>

God... that made me feel so dirty. Emu rape I can deal with, but not that terrible mangling of language. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not a fan of text messaging and even when I do it I insist on proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation at all times. I will use a period at the end of a single sentence in a text message. It is the proper way to write.

 <em>The presumable sexual partner has sent a message in which they are experiencing a painful burning sensation during urination and wish to determine whether you may have experienced the same symptoms. They suspect that you may have infected them with Chlamydia. Their poor spelling and general disdain for language and usage implies that maybe they are aroused or perhaps they think that you have given them diarrhea.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suspect you also get blurry self-shot close-ups of various erogenous zones intended to arouse you and imply that the sender wishes to engage in coitus. Perhaps these are sent to multiple parties as the sender does not realize that this will be visible due to an unfamiliarity with working the device. Perhaps they do not care. Perhaps they wish it to be a race and derive personal satisfaction from that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ultimately I have no idea. I basically only started sending them recently and then only to friends when they are at work or such and would not be in a position to take a phone call, even a short one.

      I always interpreted it as a tragedy that occurred after the child was born, but before it reached the shoe-wearing stage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I loathe children basically as hard as anyone can, but even I found it affecting and a bit sad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps the lady is so poor that she now needs to sell the shoes where a wealthier person would hold onto them as a reminder of the child or perhaps in anticipation of another child. She is not. Those little shoes are for sale. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also a good reason not to buy shoes for a child in case they might be horribly mutilated or killed before they have a chance to wear them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The way you can tell it is Hemingway and not Steinbeck is twofold 1)Hemingway was notable for his short, terse prose and Steinbeck, I would say, was not 2)It doesn't suck. Steinbeck is basically distilled suck. Fuck him and his populist bullshit.

      That is why you do science. You basically never have to write papers. When you do they're lab reports and while they can swell to a dozen or so pages the majority of that is presenting tables of data or discussing the data directly. It really basically writes itself most of the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem is that the analytical component is not something you can bullshit. You need to know what you're talking about and have paid attention throughout all of your classes in order to make intelligent and reasoned observations based on your experiments.

Anything where you do an experiment in order to gain knowledge is a science.  There are soft sciences and hard sciences.  The fact it that there are a lot of people out there who need mental help, and psychologists are there to help them.  I know you didn't say that psychologists are worthless (like sociologists are); I just wanted to throw that out there. <br/> 
Psych is a science, just a soft science.  I can't stand hard science most of the time.  I don't see how so many people can in biology and chemistry.  We need those majors; I just can't see why that many people enjoy them that much.

      I am stuck on things I can quantify.  I don't dislike English professors, I just can't understand the criteria so my marks are basically a mystery to me.  At least with a physics assignment, I know when I fucked up big time and can be ready for the poor grade. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus I am basically not a fan of saying the same thing different ways, which in my eyes is what the majority of English essays amounts to.  First you say it in the introduction, then you say it again at the start of each paragraph, then you say it a couple more times in the body of the paragraph, then you quote some old geezer who said it, then you say it again to sum up the paragraph, wash, rinse, repeat.  Conclude by stating the same thing again.  Maybe this is why I never go wall-of-text on you guys.

      It is possible to write good English papers without saying the same thing over and over again. You just have to find a position and argue it using multiple pieces of evidence (the most effective ones)until you reach the page limit. If you have room you can devote a paragraph to discussing an opposing argument and why you think it is wrong. <br/>

      And this is why my 10 page essays usually turn into 7 pagers.  I can't stand repeating myself, and when I do just to make my paper longer, I'll get notes like "EVIDENCE??? EXAMPLES??? YOU HAVE GREAT IDEAS BUT NO SUPPORT LOLZ." Then when you add more quotes to give evidence: "TOO MANY QUOTES NOT ENOUGH OF YOUR OWN GREAT IDEAS."  Then when you take away the quotes and state your own ideas, you get the evidence bit again.  English is a blessing and a curse.

      I gotta say, it helps that there are courses at University about literature I find  <strong>interesting</strong> .  All through high school, the texts were rather transparent and there's only so much you can say about Shakespeare that hasn't already been said.  I'm not necessarily saying  <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</em>  has more scholastic value than  <em>Life of Pi</em>  but it's more the kind of thing I can read 3 or 4 times and not be done absorbing it.

      Yeah. I love  <em>Animal Farm</em>  with a fiery passion, but there is basically only one thing you can say about it. It depends on how exhaustive and detailed you want to be, but there is basically one thing to say.

      Weird. I majored in Biology and Microbiology (and really, it was molecular genetics but that wasn't a degree option) and took a minor in Computer Science. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, I took humanities courses from time to time, but I never took anything to a high enough level that I would have to write papers longer than maybe five pages or so. I simply can't imagine writing longer papers than that and I'm a rather loquacious fellow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Science, as long as they're not making me just outright memorize things (which I cannot do) was always fairly easy for me. Sadly being good at analysis does not necessarily translate into better grades when your ability to memorize things basically doesn't work (JUSTIN BAILEY) even though it's the part that's actually important to doing real work. Then again, I hate writing. I'd much rather spend a few hours in the lab than have to write for that same period of time.

      Yeah, but you got consumption so it was at least romantic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, La Boheme was eventually ripped off into Rent while basically nobody has ever written anything about how awesome it is to be Dickens. Even his works are reduced to either over-saturated Christmas performances and knock-off TV specials or are forced on teens in 9th grade and used, at best, as parodic material for the French Revolution. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Essentially both suck, but being a starving artist proves to be romantic and cool and will make high school students think you're really profound as long as you're too poor to actually do anything they're likely to read or that will be perceived as popular.

I would chubby you for thoughtfulness but I've already given out too many and assetbar won't let me give out any more.   <br/>

      I spent some time yesterday having to imagine Weird Al receiving a blowjob from Alanis Morissette in a theater. This is especially terrible because I really dislike Morissette. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The entire exchange is based on Weird Al making a reference to the line in "You Oughta Know" that it was always fun going to movies with her. He is totally the sort of guy you do not want to make a joke about getting head. She is totally a scary, unpleasant sort of person you do not want to imagine giving head. It was entirely awful.

      Wolfentsi's comment is in character for his avatar "Minsk" a simple minded evil crushing wilderness man from the Role Playing Game "Baldur's Gate". Minsk has brain damage and his best friend since the incident is a hamster that a big-city con-man convinced him was a miniature giant space hamster, "boo" is his name. philippe and minsk share similar mental capacity, and would likely be fast friends.

      Yes, that line came off poorly, the CG was deep in the uncanny valley, and my eyes were accosted by the bare ass of Anthony Hopkins. But all that  aside, the movie still wasn't that bad, largely to the credit of Neil Gaiman, who wrote the screenplay. He does well taking advantage of the interoperability of oral myth, not unlike what Michael Chrichton did with eaters of the dead. I'm not saying rush out and rent it, but it's really not all that bad.

      There was a little-known film version of Beowulf made in Iceland and released in 2005 that was actually quite good and had kind of an artsy Scandinavian film vibe to it. It's called  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101104/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_%26_Grendel">Beowulf &amp; Grendel</a>  and it starred that guy from 300 before his face was an Internet meme. <br/>

The 1999 post-apocalyptic version with the guy from Highlander was excruciating, however.

      I agree with you. Putting the punctuation inside the quotes never makes any sense. You would do that if it was punctuation that referred to the quote, but if it's the end of the sentence without respect to the quote being there it shouldn't go inside. That would fail to demarcate the end of the sentence. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's just very stupid and wrong. Come with me and we shall fight the power and keep our infinitives from splitting because you cannot do that in Latin!

      It's a Canadian import. Don't hassle him about it. It's totally legit. The only problem is that sometimes you get an "Eh!" instead of a "Yes" and it can take a bit longer to get them, but they're cheaper and federally subsidized.

      That's much of the problem. They just don't run a tight enough ship up there all the time. I mean, yeah, they produce a comparable product, but it's not going to take off with the majority of Americans for a variety of reasons (most Americans will certainly not be happy using repurposed surplus Yeses originally intended for hockey). It's not that they're lax, but they also have problems because they have to handle a significant number of "Oui!"s as well. Not to mention having to deal with demand for " <em>mais oui</em> "s and even the niche market for an occasional " <em>bien sur</em> " along with all the American "OH YEAH!"s that come across the border. How could they not be overworked? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd say we should consider the potential admission of a Candadian "Yes", but not to be too hasty until we see how they integrate into the current market. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Are we still going to ship the "Yes!" with the optional fist-pump or is that considered to be too much of a luxury good for government providence?

      He actually wants you to commit seppuku because you shamed Assetbar. <br/> 
Also, I seem to have missed the terrible thing you have done.  Was it posting "unread"? <br/> 
Because posting "unread" really isn't a big deal.  I mean, if saying "unread" is a problem for a person, then that person should just relax, <br/>

      True, but it normally isn't necessary to do that unless people are actively trying to derail you. It was this intent to deceive that was my main issue with it. If it just came up in casual conversation I'd have ignored it.

      I never said that photography isn't an art (other people have totally said that though, I think there was just something on Kottke about it the other day), I just said that a lot of award-winning photographs have been a case of right place, right time. Many times the photographers themselves say this. It doesn't make them less awesome, but they are certainly caused by a great deal of luck.

By the way, just FYI -- I am not really a fan of Guns N' Roses. I have one song called "My Michelle" because I found out that Capcom basically stole it and made it the background music in a level in  <em>Rockman X3</em>  and nobody cared or suspected a thing. <br/>

      "Nightrain", "November Rain", and "Don't Cry" are pretty much the only really worthwhile ones I've heard. If you like "My Michelle", the AFI cover might be interesting to you. Or not.

      More proof that autrepoupee is a 35 year old man. <br/>

She's right, though.  Appetite and Lies.  Anything past that is pretty bad.  With songs like Paradise City and Patience, they showed how to make an epic, rock song the right way.  They lost it with bloated, Meatloaf-style toss offs like November Rain and Don't Cry.

      Paradise City? Yeah, brah, that song totally rocks! I totally make devil horns and bang my head in an exaggerated manner while sticking my tongue out and closing my eyes every time it comes on the juke down at the campus bar! <br/>

I think I've recently figured out that I don't like music whose general effect and animating purpose seem to about having a Good Time. That explains my choice of Guns N' Roses songs quite well I think.

      <em>What the fuck are you talking about?</em>   Are you seriously trying to portray Paradise City as the only Guns n' Roses song that bros "rock out" to?  I know you were only 6 or so when Use You Illusion came out, but I know you're knot that naive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Guns n' Roses is staple music for assholes, we all know and accept this, but they also made some good music.  We disagree which is which, but please don't act like November Rain and Don't Cry actually have some kind of "cred," for fuck's sake. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And, though I don't recommend ever "analyzing" GNR lyrics, I don't think Paradise City is about having a Good Time.  In fact, I doubt any song on Appetite is (well, maybe in a "get fucked up in a semi-tragic way").  We all know that the bros out there PUMPING FISTS only care about the chorus, but that's not the best way to judge the atmosphere of a song.

      My girlfriend, who otherwise has little to no interest in music, likes Paradise City. I have found, through careful application, that she seems to rather like Guns and Roses in general. This is unexpected. She has, in the past, said positive things about John Denver. This is just totally not her sort of thing. Don't shit on that please.

      Hey, November Rain has a moment in the video where Slash is all "Don't want to mess up your wedding dude, but I totally have an awesome guitar solo to shoot outside with an amazingly unnecessary helicopter shot." I don't see how you can be against that. <br/>

      They are not back. "Shackler's Revenge" is amazingly bad. I'll admit I was predisposed to dislike it, but it is not good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Zeitgeist was kind of the same thing, but Corgan didn't spend 15 years making it. He just realized that all of his other post-Pumpkins projects that he kept dragging Chamberlain along in weren't doing very well and if he brought back the famous name and tried to work a bit more consciously in that sound he might be relevant again. I do not feel that it worked, but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as  <em>Chinese Democracy</em> .

      It's often just a subset of Poi in some way or another. A friend of mine was/is into it. It strikes me as kinda like devil sticks, but for this decade and not quite as widespread. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you are practicing it on Hippie Hill in Golden Gate Park people will totally come up to you and talk to you about it because they are also into it. A good number of them are homeless because they more or less choose to be and just sort of travel around. <br/>

If you are a guy you will totally slam one of them into your sack. This is inevitable. It hurts a lot.

      I am in favor of perky titties, not fat. Even the phrasing is deprecated as many people have legitimately fat breasts and those are saggy and disgusting. I have known people who like to think that they are "big" and thus desirable, but they are wrong. When you have gained weight and, as a result, your breasts are enlarged with some of your fat they are not awesome. They are just fat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do have to wonder where I would find someone wearing those shorts though. Basically her entire ass is out. Not that I have anything against that (well, she does look like an unpleasant skank and I'm neither partial to asses nor to that type of ass), but that's seriously a lot of ass to be showing off. I don't think I've seen that much in places where showing of the ass is largely considered acceptable.

Instead of scrolling down the entire page, keeping your eyes wide open for a flash of yellow, sctolling up if you see a black box (have those been fixed?  I haven't seen one in a while), etc, you can just type in [ unread ] in "find".

      So, do I have to be the first person to point out that this isn't  <em>really</em>  the 1500th strip?  I'm willing to count the "strips" from the baby-being-born period as strips because technically, they're "new" material, but the numerous holiday time reruns and zine previews don't really count as strips, do they? <br/>

Man, I sound like one of those guys in 1999 who always argued that 2001 was  <em>really</em>  the beginning of the new millenia: no matter how right I may be, no one gives a shit.

RAY: Man I put em on the turntable and let the needle down low but as far as I'm concerned those albums just never got started man. <br/> 
 <br/> 
TEODOR: You're throwing out a first generation iPod too? <br/> 
 <br/> 
RAY: Yeah I had a bunch of mp3s on my computer that I got sick of waiting for them to start so I just put them all on there and am lettin the hobos investigate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
TEODOR: Don't you know how to delete them? <br/> 
 <br/> 
RAY: I ain't got no time to be dragging stuff to the trash bin. I'm a busy man and I was just trying to get all the problems away. Deal.

      I still use a second generation iPod. I really wish I had one of the cool newer ones with actual features and the ability to use all the peripherals that everyone else has been using since 2003, but I've never had the money and well... even if it's a bit low on space and rather physically large (hey, the 20 gig model was the biggest they had at the time!), in monochrome and with no ability to make playlists on-the-fly, rate songs, or do a hell of a lot of other things it  <em>does</em>  still play music just like it did when I first got it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't get the iPhone though. Or, for that matter, the Nano. Only 8 gig? How in the hell do you put anything on there? The iPhone seems nice, but it's not a convergence device for me until it can actually support enough space that I can replace my iPod with it.

      My boss just gave me a 3rdGen iPod so I can put some pop dross on it for his daughter. I took it home to find it was slightly lacking in space. Turns out he's bought a 500MB USB stick inside an iPod case.

      I'm also an old fan of Palm OS. I think this whole locked-down, proprietary, company-run app store thing where they seemingly want to charge you for everything is not the best of ways. <br/>

Also, how does it sync calendar data to Windows/Linux? I haven't been able to find a single decent desktop calender program that uses the .cal format. Nobody these days supports Palm format either which totally blows. There's no way in hell that I would ever use Outlook.

      I had my own TV in my own TV room (as a child I had a ludicrously huge walk-in close large enough to be it's own, somewhat narrow room... not including my toy room) as a child and have never really watched TV with my parents. It seems odd to have done so. Even now if I happen to be home or such it would feel weird to watch Futurama or something when my parents were around.

      Yeah, it has taken some time for me to realize that I was apparently somewhat spoiled as a child. I was an only child in an upper-middle class suburb and my mother was (and is) amazingly protective and clingy to the point that I moved as far away as I possibly could while still being in the same country partially just to get away from her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't whine and beg as a kid though so it took a while for me to figure it out. I was basically like most of the other kids I knew.

      I believe you misspelled Arrested Development back there. Perhaps you were trying to spell Firefly, but it got weirdly auto-corrected? <br/>

Is it time to start a big argument about Father Ted/Spaced/Black Books again? I love them all so damn much. The IT Crowd, however... it does nothing for me. It feels like decade-old stereotypes wrapped up in a big load of "not very funny, not funny at all".

      Fuck that. Someone can say Arrested Development is not their thing, or that they don't really get what makes it funny (because, like Achewood, you really do have to get to know the characters). But to say you HATE it? Ridiculous. Then again, he said he doesn't like 'moving pictures' in general, which I'm still trying to process.

anyway, it's just funny because you said a while back (stereo did) that you don't understand why people hate popular things (in regards to Nickelback) yet you hate  movies, Arrested Development, and basically anything else most normal people like.

      The thing is, Nickelback isn't trying to be funny, or thought provoking, or educational.  They're just making sounds, some with their mouths, some with vibrating pieces of metal, some by means of electronic signal processing.  I happen to like some of those sounds. So I listen to them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Arrested Development isn't all bad, it's just ridiculously unsuitable for syndication.  The only way most of it makes sense is if you're watching the shows consecutively, and how often will you get that from random TV broadcast? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I never learned how to watch movies when I was a kid, so now I struggle to maintain interest in them.  Probably my problem, I'm not saying they're inherently bad, I just can't get anything from most movies.  I'd rather read a description of a movie than to see the movie in itself, "the pictures in my head are always better than reality".  If I know the story, the movie is a disappointment.  If I don't know the story, I struggle to tell the difference between movies.  At one point I would have said this means I like them equally, but then I found out about silent movies, enjoyed them a lot more than any talkie I've seen, and decided instead that I do not like movies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still think popularity is a pretty arbitrary measure of how "good" something is.  I don't find any contradiction in agreeing with some popular stuff and disagreeing about others.  I just seem to run across more people who are outspoken about music they hate, I am trying to balance that out by hating television and movies because frankly I'm bored of people talking about how terrible (West Kenya? I don't know) is.

      I think because music defines us more than movies or television does. I have friends that don't like the same music I do but still enjoy the indie movies that I do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not trying to say that you are a bad person or anything for not liking movies, there are plenty of movies I wish  <em>didn't exist</em>  and that I hate, but I just kind of found it funny that you railed on people not liking popular things. <br/> 
 <br/>

      If you meant Brent Spiner, that is untrue. He once recorded an album called  <em>Ol' Yellow-Eyes Is Back</em> . I believe Jonathan Frakes may have been involved as well, but I'm not certain. I do not have a copy but boy would I like to find one someday. I'm sure it'd be hilarious.

      Not trying to be funny, Stereo, but it sounds like there is something wrong with your brain. No-one else 'learned how' to watch movies as a kid, I didn't watch a film til i was about fifteen. It's called suspension of disbelief. If you're incapable of it, you're missing something like a synapse link. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with you or that. Maybe it's just how you worded it.

      Not really what I meant.  I don't have trouble following fictional plots or characters, just presentation of them as a movie.  Something about the pacing doesn't work for me, and I have trouble picking up the details that are important to me.  I generally need to watch a movie several times to fully understand what goes on, cause things will pass me by. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe it's cause I mostly watch Tarantino movies... <br/> <br/> <br/> I dunno about something wrong with my brain, I do things differently than most people but I have been under the impression that it is normal for an adolescent to feel like they are unique and nobody understands them.  I don't really want to come off like it's true, but 3rd party confirmation is nice. <br/> <br/> <br/> Does wanting to use statistical tools to analyze plot devices and recurring themes in stories make me different?  Cause I'm seriously considering looking at the frequency of appearance of certain symbols within Watchmen, along with the appearance of characters, to see if I can find some unexpected links and maybe get a deeper understanding of how Moore put this stuff together.  I've been told nothing is an accident - maybe if I study the graffiti I can find some parallels with the characters.

      If these things do not make you happy in some way, you should stop watching them.  I've never seen a one.  People talk about them and I usually have read about them enough to know they exist, and you can pick up whatever you need to understand (almost nothing) from the context.  It's real easy.

Not everything English people touch turns to gold; they have a lot of shitty ideas about comedy, something that a lot of people try and dispute.  For instance, they air reruns of Friends pretty much all day. <br/>

      Simon Amstell pretty much hit the nail on the head when making fun of the Boosh's nonsense humour on NMtB that time. That said, they do actually have occasions of genuine hilarity. The only one I can think of right now is Breakfast Bob, but I'm relatively sure there were others. <br/>

You want to talk about bad British comedy? Talk about Little Britain/The Catherine Tate Show. <br/>

And Peep Show is still the best comedy. I only watch drama set in hospitals, so I feel ill-prepared to comment.

      Actually, it's a pretty good pick for the "best sketch."  Not that it's my favorite, either, but, when I lived in England, that was always the sketch referred to when talking about Monty Python (even more so that the "Ni" sketch from Holy Grail) in the media and popular culture in general.

      Mmm, no, Life of Brian's really good. <br/>

Holy Grail, though...okay, there's the really, really funny parts everyone knows and loves. Which amounts to, what...maybe half an hour. The rest of it? Boring, not funny. IN MY OPINION.  <br/>

The Meaning of Life is the best one though, I think.

      The only problem with Holy Grail is that after they cross the Bridge of Death it kind of loses focus and isn't really funny anymore. They didn't really seem to know how to end it and it was definitely more of a loose collection of sketches than a coherent film. Still, IIRC it's a fairly accurate parody of another film about The Matter of Britain.

It was hyped AFTER it was out for a while and on DVD and shit, and all the nerds who weren't cool enough to hang with the scene kids would quote it, and this was when I was in-between social classes at school so I had it shoved in my face like I was Jenna Jameson in a gangbang porno.

      Yes, I too saw it when I was young. I also read Hitchiker's Guide before having ever heard of it and got into a number of other things before they were hyped and ruined for me. That is not to say that a lot of things were not ruined for me due to hype. Thankfully they were just not generally things that I would be sorely upset at having not appreciated.

      There's a good number of unmemorable sketches in the Flying Circus, but, as someone who has watched them many times over the last 20 years, I can't agree with the "utter crap" sentiment.  The last few times I've gone through the Monty Python "Archives," as it were, I've watched it realizing that I shouldn't take it for granted that everything they touched was gold; so, you could say I was kind of looking to be disappointed...but I wasn't.  There's a decent amount of shitty sketches, and a lot of gold, but there's a huge bell curve of just decent/good material.  The kind of stuff that 14 year olds never quote, and doesn't stick in the brain, but when you watch it, you get a laugh and think, at least, "that was pretty clever" or "that was well-performed." <br/> 
 <br/> 
In short, I think you watched a Family Guy episode where they slammed the "lesser" Monty Python stuff and you've taken it to heart.  Remember, a Family Guy writer accusing Monty Python of having a lot of sub-par filler material should be considered punishable by death for outright FUCKING HYPOCRISY.

      I keep hearing how people say good things about The IT Crowd, but it just... it feels like reheated Dilbert or so some sort of lame joke by someone in middle management based on geek stereotypes, but not written by someone who knows what they're talking about. Even if it may be written with some input by people who know what they're talking about it has catered to a mainstream view of things. It's more like they're trying to pretend that they have credibility by dropping in things that actual geeks really do like, but they don't get them themselves. Is middle-aged man trying to be "fresh" and "jive" to children in late-80s sitcom, yes? <br/>

What happened, Chris? Did signing titties and having overweight, neckbearded, bespectacled white guys sweat copiously at the sight of you trigger your latent rock-star mentality, whereby it's now okay to rest on your admittedly impressive archives, churn out the indie webcomic equivalent of Garfield once a week, and treat admirers of your work with disregard, if not outright contempt?

      Okay, fine. I've bought books and apparel, and I attended a signing, now am I entitled to complain? <br/> 
 <br/> 
To further choke the analogy, if, say, The Liars (replace the band name as necessary) had been putting out great material gratis for years on end, then said they were going to release a free album Tuesday evening, and not only does it not show up until Wednesday afternoon, it's also a trite retread of old material, wouldn't you be disappointed? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I bought the merchandise I did because I enjoyed the comics immensely and wanted to support the artist's future endeavors. Now that the work isn't as good, is the solution me spending even more money for something I once enjoyed for free, and now enjoy considerably less? Should I now be content with sporadic, mediocre comics that don't even show up "on time"?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd write more about supporting artists who are producing work nowhere near the calibre of their previous achievements, but I'm buying tickets to Aerosmith as we speak DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY YAK-YAK-YAK-YOOOOW!!!

      A free turd on a plate is still a crappy dinner. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not that I'd rank the comic THAT low, with floaters like megatokyo raking in vast amounts of money, but the general quality has really gone downhill as of late. Which is indeed why I'm hesitant to shell out for the paid stuff - a year ago, dear Onstad would have gotten whatever he cared to charge from me for the extra content. <br/> <br/> <br/> I'd personally prefer <one strip a week on the level of the GOF arc over 2-3 strips a week on the level of this one.

      You know, I can't help but sympathize with khailautomatic here.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
This whiny, fan-boy attitude is asinine and unnecessary, though: what, do you think that, even if Onstad reads your comment, he'd suddenly change his creative mode because of you criticism?  Fans bitching about "work going downhill," when it gets to the creator(s), tends to just breed more contempt for the fans. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's alright to feel that the work isn't as good anymore, and it's find to write about it here (though you're going to get lames, welcome to assetbar), but try not to make it sound like an impotent lover's parting shot at his ex. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let's face it, as fans of this guy's work, it's a little frustrating that he's posted so few comics over the last few months.  I mean, shit, we're gonna have  <strong>7</strong>  for the whole month of November.  Onstad averaged about 15-18 a month for most of this comic's run, but it's closer to 9-10 over the last few months, and they  <em>are</em>  constantly late...something people would bitch less about if he didn't set these deadlines and constantly break them.  Pathetic it maybe, but it's pretty obvious that's going to annoy people if you do it again and again.  I don't live my life around Achewood updates, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't refesh this shit a lot while I'm having slow days at work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I try not to complain that much, though, because I just can't imagine that it's going to do any good.  Onstad is going to do what he's going to do, he apparently has other projects in the pipeline, and your just going to have to live with it.

      Sure, but rational, patient people on the internet are largely ignored, mainly because they're  <em>boring.</em>  Commenting on Assetbar provides the momentary diversion from scholastic matters that the comic used to, and with the number of detailed discourses on abstruse, pedantic texts I've got to write, it's a joy to be able to type the word "titties" and get away with it.

      Yeah, I believe David Mirkin was making this point on the commentary for the "Lisa the Vegetarian" episode of the Simpsons. Essentially a lot of stuff is just fake substitutes for meat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I feel super-bad for animals and totally don't want to kill them, but I cannot give up on eating meat. It is so good and so awesome and so necessary to the majority of cooking. I kind of understand though. I often have similar problems trying to keep alcohol out of cooking. One cause at a time though I guess. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was talking to my girlfriend yesterday when shopping about how free-range, organic, all-natural, cruelty-free is basically the expression of liberal guilt over eating animals. We feel bad because of it, but we're not willing to change our ways so we try to placate ourselves as much as possible with this sort of thing. I recall (but do not support) something making a - I believe largely satirical - point about how it's worse to have free range meats. Factory farmed animals are more likely to be miserable and long for death, but instead we're taking happy animals frolicking in the fields and then killing them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just know that we ended up buying a free range turkey and then picked up a pound of organic, grass-fed, free range ground beef instead of the regular stuff even though it was three times as much. We were going to buy the slightly cheaper stuff too, but then somehow we went with the expensive guilt-assuaging type. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Tofu is pretty decent. It basically doesn't taste like anything, but it's dirt cheap and good for Chinese and Japanese cooking most of the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Indian/Pakistani is the way to go with vegetarianism though. They've been rocking that for a long time and know how to make it work. Even Anthony Bourdain is down with that.

      Organic and all-natural are fine with me.  I don't know how you can claim "cruelty free" on anything that's not a vegetable, though. (hey, can they breed braindead cows? That would be ideal) <br/> <br/> <br/> I'm not down with "meat substitutes".  If I want to be a vegetarian, I'll stop eating meat.
