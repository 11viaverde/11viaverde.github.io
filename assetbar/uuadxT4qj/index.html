      Man....I was away for like a week and now I don't know what the  <strong>FUCK</strong>  is happening. <br/>

It's tempting to put my personal picture as my avatar and join in the fun.  But I'm at work and can't be shitted doing so, so what can you do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll see if I can scrounge up a picture of me wrapped in barbed wire, from my backyard wrestling days - if it still exists (possibly lost in the ether of CyberSpace.  Or something else. <br/>

      Nope.  Google searched - you muthafuckas miss out on seeing a circa 2001 photo of my pasty white, shirtless and bleeding, barbed-wire covered, backwards hat and grinning like a mental patient 17-year-old self. <br/>

Oh, I know it.  It's the necessary thing that comes to  mind.  I'm working on it, I assure you.  I have to call in a few favours, and offer some favours in uncomfortable ways, but I must make it happen.  I  <em>must.</em> <br/>

And Hamscout - don't you dare do it.  You know you shouldn't.  There's no point in being That Guy.  That Guy That Ruins The Page For Everyone.  It's just masturbatory meta-humour. <br/>

I have a really big  <strong>thing</strong>  for Gordon Freeman and in fact my boyfriend looks remarkably like him, as in people have remarked upon it, quite often. And I- I- I keep typing the beginning of this sentence and then backspacing out of there because it is far too weird to write about, even on this, the craziest of assetbar comments pages. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway yeah I hadn't actually made the tekende-Freeman connection in my own mind but now edwell says it, it totally makes sense. And I already mentioned tekende being damn hot, so I'd better not creep him out further by saying it again.

      Dude, chill. Reading too much into everything is kind of a running theme on Assetbar, and the obvious irony is that I could only make such an observation based on an extrapolation of my own inner thoughts in similar situations. We're all guilty of this in some way shape or form, you just happened to be the most direct about it which is why people saw fit to just mention it. No one's offended - let's not ruin the general vibe.

      Ok, I just realized the irony of my using irony as an excuse for pointing out the pointlessness of your irony. I'd make an apology card out of this, but it would probably be more like an apology essay. So yea, sorry about that, carry on.

      But I think the fact that you said "actually" kind of lends to the fact that there might have originally been some hesitation? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know. To me, she just sort of seems like the type of girl that girls love to hate. <br/>

Not to mention the fact that she's begging to let Tory (and, not to mention, Adam) into her pants on a regular basis.

      It just annoys me, but not because I have an inherent problem with being hit on dudes.  The situations where this happens, I will be at a crowded party and feel someone cop an ass-grab.  I turn around, and I can't identify the culprit, and all the guys immediately behind me are dudes.  And I'm like "awww" <br/>

It's not the idea of being hit on by guys, it's just that the situations build my hopes up and turn out sort of disappointing.

You need to get a picture taken of yourself with Mr. Fry as this would meet everyone's needs. Possibly just photoshop him in there. Even better, photoshop Stephen Fry with  <em>his</em>  hand on your face. <br/>

      This is about as confusing as when blahmargarky changed her icon to her dressed like Prince. All these different parts of my brain are arguing with each other over the evidence and whether it's rockin' man-dangle or not, sort of like an episode of  <em>Homicide: Life on the Street</em> . There is nothing more sexual than a bunch of overweight, under-paid men standing around chainsmoking and yelling at each other. <br/>

Then there's always that one kind of weird detective with a big grin on his face who keeps saying, "Does it even matter anyway? Would you still go for it?" but yeah no one pays attention to that guy

      I always figured falseprophet's first avatar (which be had up for a few months a while back) was a picture of him, and if I recall correctly, it wasn't a picture of a gangly white kid. <br/>

Plus he's renowned as the representative of Black America on AssetBar.  <em>How do you not know this</em> .

      Yeah that was me, from back when I had dreads. Had to cut em off after graduation. Then I did an interview for an internship at a tiny weekly newspaper and the other intern who had already been hired was a high school classmate who still had his massive jewfro. And I felt foolish.

      I thought atheist meant that you believed firmly that there's no God, but I'm okay about being wrong now and then.  <br/>

I wonder if there's a word for when you think that, instead of wearing a crucifix/star of David/whatever, you think you should be wearing a question mark, because you just don't know?

      Oh wow, remarkably similar to me sort of! And yeah I know what you mean, I hardly ever meet anybody who ticks all the boxes of jewry (i.e. practising and by upbringing and so on) so I'm totally down with the idea that that's a difficult question and usually doesn't have a quick answer. Hecks, this is why we have  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003351/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F">Wikipedia: Who is a Jew?</a>  (Answer: your mum). <br/> 
 <br/> 
My own mum is a convert so there was always quite a bit of the ol' religion around when I was growing up, now I do not go to shul or believe that organised religion is particularly healthy or that it is possible to believe in an interventionist god, and so on, and wait a minute I'm not about to start discussing my intellectual outlook on religion on Acheworld, that ain't right, why did I even- <br/>

Not that I don't appreciate the unintentional Star Wars tie in, but I got it from a funny little thing in a mostly serious movie--the 'Ham' costume that Scout wears in the moviefilm of "To Kill A Mockingbird".  I laughed  <em>so</em>  hard at that...

I mean, don't get me wrong, this is cool and all, but understand that for the past year or so I've thought of all of you people as basically small magic goblins living in my computer off of Internet, a natural resource farmed or possibly mined somewhere in rural Ohio. To have a face to match with comments and understand that you're people like me and thus are capable of living, breathing, being prosecuted for one to several counts of first degree murder, or maybe even getting a boat loan, is sort of a trip.  <br/>

Paradigms have shifted. Schisms have been rewritten. Handles have been vigorously jiggled. Tomorrow I wake to a new dawn, yet I believe it may just a better one.

      I predict that you will in some instances be taken more seriously.  Example:  certain feminist policy prescriptions can be taken as certain feminists trying to force men in general to do things to benefit them because no way in hell would these women be able to get particular, individual men to do things to benefit them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This post is not to imply that you are one of those women or have made those sorts of arguments.  It is just to say that it would be much harder to dismiss you as an embittered man-hater.

Yeah, no but seriously folks... lolcats is...  is a terrible thing... The first lolcat was probably funny.  But ever since then, it's been the same damn joke over and over and over and over.  Once and again, by and by, ya might find some stain of originality in a lolcat, but generally, lolcats are the top-40 of internet humor.  The Lolcat formula is the worst meme ever.  Okay.

your avitar is kind of.. a hell of a lot different now... quite pixelated so I can't see your face at all but still I imagine in my mind's eye a rather gentle sort of happy fellow, whereas, that other avitar, was sort of intimidating, you know.. made me feel kind of like Sigourney Weaver.

I look like this. The other avatar, well, that was me as well in a hairier capacity. <br/> 
I am Canadian, and my linguistic patterns are somewhat an anomoly that I really cannot justify.  <br/> 
I was stating in that second sentance as an addendum to your idea of the lolcats for irritating memes, was those images with the black borders you may see at a dentist office or place of business.

I think I just missed the memo that was sent out when everyone decided that the only acceptable music is jangly folk wankery and 20-minute ambient drone tracks.

      I don't know, but I get that all the time. The last time I heard it was from a girl who was staying at the same hostel in Munich. Her exact words were "You look like Demetri Martin... and you're funny too!" Somehow even after that and an intense two-hour conversation about The Cure and LSD while hunched over pitchers of strawberry margaritas at a seedy 'Mexican-themed' bar where all the bartenders were strapping Aryan men wearing ill-fitting sombreros, I still could not muster the courage to make any sort of move, and she eventually left with a friend. I don't know why I have so many of these stories or why my life resembles some sort of depressing existentialist novel.

      Eternia was dark that day, and cold.  The spring rains had come, bringing vague shadows of winter's grim chill back to haunt the Kingdom of Eternos.  Prince Adam shrugged his heavy velveteen cloak forward to better warm himself, but it did little good.  He was caught unawares by the shower on his morning ride and the cloak was already sopping and slapping him uncomfortably on his tanned, well-toned thighs as he rode Cringer toward Castle Greyskull.  He would have to disrobe and stay a spell in the ancient citadel if he was not to catch a death. <br/> 
	Leaving Cringer to sleep in the great hall, Adam set his clothes out to dry and began to explore Castle Greyskull.  He had been there so many times, but always in a rush to call on He-Man, always with the tunnel-vision that panic brings to sight, the memories of his hundreds of visits blurred to one thin line that began- and ended- with his alter ego.  The air in the castle was somehow warm, and it felt good on his bare skin.  He had wandered for a time, and quickly realized that he was in a room he had never seen before, a room of mirrors.  His reflection doubled, tripled, manipulated and repeated a countless number of times.  <br/> 
	 One mirror was different, however; the largest in the room.  It was placed directly opposite of  the door Adam had stepped through, and was ornately filigreed with skulls and flowers.  The reflection  it presented was not Adam at all, but He-Man himself.  The man who he was and yet, was not, stared back at him, Sword of Power in hand, as Adam stood, so nude, across from him.  Chest muscles bulged powerfully and equally on each side of the room.  The image lingered where it was a moment longer, then stepped out of the very mirror, striding powerfully with bulging calves until he stood not a foot from Adam, hot nostril-breath tautening the skin of his chest, giving him goose-pimples.  He-Man regarded his other self severely, but not unkindly, and slowly lowered his face... <br/>

      Excellent.  I have a theory on this.  Granted, with modern music, gentlemen are more apt to learn and play songs that appeal to the ladies of their generation, like that execrable "She Talks to Angels" by the Black Crowes.  My opinion is, you find a nice, short, truthful song like "Don't Fence Me In" and it's catnip to the ladies.  Of course, you being of a slightly older  <em>genera</em>  than myself, it's a moot point, but they're both fun to sing and play.

Also, your copy of my pose is  <em>exemplary</em> . Although having recreated it, you probably think I'm the weirdest ever for posing like that, so you should know that I had my elbow resting on a desk, and then my face resting on my hand. So it's a lot more natural and comfortable than it seems.

      Last year I was at a Halloween party in some loft/warehouse deal. I was dressed as Dorian Gray and no one was getting it  <em>at all</em> , even though I was carrying a picture of myself that had been photoshopped with wrinkles and everything. Then out of nowhere this riduclously beautiful girl dressed as Poison Ivy, red hair and all, comes up to me and asks if I'm supposed to be Dorian Gray. I say yes, and she replies "I visited Oscar Wilde's grave in Paris and kissed it...so now I have to kiss you." Which she does, then turns around and promptly disappears into the crowd. After I recovered from my mildly catatonic state, I spent a good half hour traversing the maze of rooms and rooftops looking for her, but to no avail. <br/>

      I have a gorgeous redhead friend who lives in Manhattan (but goes to parties in Brooklyn sometimes) and has spent extensive time in Paris. She sexually rewards people for having good taste in literature (she once slept with a guy just coz he liked Camille Paglia), and I know she's dressed up as Jessica Rabbit before, which is kinda like dressing up as Poison Ivy. If she is not the person who kissed you, she is  <em>at least</em>  her evil twin.

      I hadn't heard of him until you posted that, but it was fairly awesome. Anyway, don't be jealous, the primary pastime of everyone who lives here is complaining about being surrounded by people who look and dress exactly like them even though that was  <em>precisely the reason</em>  they moved here in the first place. I'd like to think I'm not part of this big post-ironic circle jerk - I mean I'd still rather listen to At the Gates and Blind Guardian than pretend to worship Bob Dylan any day. Besides, I don't qualify as a starving artist - the only art I create is unnecessarily long-winded messageboard posts. I just moved here because it was close to my school and better than the alternatives, and I'd rather walk into a bar and hear Dragonforce than hip-hop, even if said Dragonforce is being played half-jokingly by some bearded douche.

The first night I was amazed, the next day I went out and got their cd's so I could sing along at the second show.

      Ok, this might start getting weird, but are you talking about that girl from the1585? (Full disclosure: I looked at your livejournal once and you had it linked). I read some of their articles and thought they were right on for the most part, but I'm not sure how I feel about the whole promiscuity as female empowerment thing. Anyway, my first reaction was no, it wasn't her, but now I'm looking at the site again and it may very well have been. Really, I just posted that story as an entertaining example of Poison Ivy hotness, not because I actually expected to find out who it was. But shit, if you solved this mystery how awesome would that be? So yea, ask your friend.

      Actually, it's an assetbar issue. Save your photo as a 50x50 pixel picture, and reupload it. Use "cubic" or similar level interpolation if your programme has such a setting.

      *shrug* I had no issues, and the image I uploaded was 237x276.  I saved it with the JPG compression setting on "highest" quality too in case that helps.  It might have to do with the java implementation on a given platform?  I'm not sure what interpolation is.. I'm not a graphics nerd or anything. <br/>

      For the last two days I was getting strange ghosting, where some posts would not scroll with the rest of the page (and it made reading things difficult.)  I think that was a RAM issue though, because it was happening on my woefully under-memoried mac, and my windows laptop (still running firefox) displays the page perfectly fine.

I bet it was because of all the isopod shennanigans going on here. <br/>

Also a couple of nights back I had a dream that all my posts on this page had like over five lames and no chubbies and I was getting really upset about it. How outrageously pathetic is that.

      DFW is the airport code for Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport, Gateway to the American Southwest.  GBP is an assetbar-acceptable abbreviation for the monetary unit of the UK.  Many British people come here for leisure travel because of the present exchange-rate situation, even though they have the impression that America is extra-violent.

Hulk Hogan does this thing where he preens and poses for the audience when he is wrestling, and it involves twirling his hand in the air and then puts it up to his ear as if to say "I can't hear you, cheer louder." <br/>

And yes, I sometimes think it is sort of strange the precise amount, or nature, of exposure to American culture or generally  <strong>stuff</strong>  that I and my British peers get. Because we share a language and watch lots of your films and television programmes, and listen to lots of your music, and because your news is quite often in our media and your history is in our education and so on, I think it's like I have pretty good knowledge of a selection of mid- to high-brow items worthy of cultural capital; I know an acceptable amount about things like your major political parties and The Constitution and The Senate and Vietnam and Native Americans and Civil Rights, and bits of Chomsky and Howard Zinn, and aaaall about rhotic and non-rhotic /r/ accents in New York (Labov), and you know, I know classic movies like Scarface and Rambo, and modern Important or indie movies like Magnolia and American History X, and I know from Philip Roth and Walt Whitman and Ernest Hemingway... but I have no way of knowing things that are Basic, like this hilarious wrestling pose, or you know, 'Twinkies' and 'Ding Dongs' (ding dongs are a  <strong>foodstuff</strong> ??) or Cathy or Marmaduke or that game show mentioned above with Alice and the squares. <br/>

      how did you still have a chubby this late in the day?! and also, thanks, I am glad my ignorance was pleasing for you. I don't know how I got that thing with that programme being a game show in my head from. I think I thought maybe it was like  <em>Celebrity Squares</em> ...?

      For just those type situations. Actually because I am probably a stingy person. <br/>

And it isn't 'ignorance' so much as a completely valid interpretation of that title screen, which while iconic and instantly recognizable in America, totally could be misconstrued as being from a game show.

      Holla for being a Brit that knows all about America. My knowledge is also helped by the fact that I dated an American for a year and a half (he lived over here). It's funny to see differences in education - do you know they teach American kids that WW2 started in 1942, because that's when they came into the war. Fucking crazy. <br/>

      Some of us are Anglophiles.  England is the only European country I've visited -- yes, there was a romance involved.  And we're really the same culture separated by a common language, as some wag said, so Brits can take credit for a lot of so-called "American" culture, thanks to the Beatles, Stones, Who, Zepplin, and the films and the remakes of shows like The Office.

      you may know more than you think, aliiis--since they refuse to hire writers with original ideas here in the US, a good portion of our programmes on the telly are just shameless ripoffs of good, honest British hard work.  Some work (The Office), some don't (Coupling).  Just know that there are fans here willing to spend time downloading anything that doesn't get shown on BBC America, so they can see the  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">original</span> , and not some yank failure that "had a good pilot in the UK". <br/>

      If it makes you feel better, I totally misread the zeitgeist when joining Acheworld, and used the least visually appealing picture of myself in an attempt to more succesfully blend in with "The Internet Crowd". <br/>

Little did I know that every achewoman was a babe, and the dudes did not all have neckbeards (bloatees if you will). Sadly, now I cannot change my avatar, for fear of being accused of whoring. <br/>

So anyway, I just realised I didn't adress your point at all, and probably did not reassure you whatsoever. Think of it this way- Axl Rose has gotten laid more than once, and he is a less than attractive man, so there is hope for uggo's everywhere. <br/>

      Yea, seems like a contrived narrative device, which is fine because I like David Foster Wallace and such. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't mean to be patronizing, but I can tell you something I've realized recently that it would have spared me a lot of grief to realize earlier in life: EVERYONE IS FAKE. There is no such thing as authenticity. From your childhood, you learn your actions, words, and mannerisms by mimicking others. Then when you realize that other people have minds just like yours through which they perceive you just as you perceive them, you inevitably orient yourself towards being perceived a certain way in order to function in society. And that IS who you "really are", because after all, you've still made the choice that you want to be perceived as one thing and not another, and in your striving to achieve the image that you've chosen you ARE being 'yourself' in the fullest sense that anyone can be. All you can hope for is to be more introspective and aware about the choices you're making. <br/>

      True dat!  What Catgrl is describing however sounds like a sort of intensity that is seen in such extreme conditions as bipolar disorder, or an LSD trip.  This really complicates the task of gaining introspection and self-awareness.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wonder if perhaps people who are hyper sensitive to their own emotions and emotional perceptions are not, perhaps, somehow,  <em>by definition,</em>  inherently less fake than the average Joe? <br/>

On this subject, lately I have been reading  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003351/https://midconet.net/achewoodtest/happiness.html">this book.</a>  I totally dig it.  It's changed my life.  I would send a copy to Roast Beef if I knew his address.

      In my younger and more formidable years I actually believed such nonsense. I would actually await such return phone calls instead of immediately contacting one of the other two Ladies Who I Thought Glanced At Me A Little Too Long In Science Class.

      It's incredibly hard to look someone in the face and say "No thanks."   Also, girlchildren are often raised to be meek and mild, and to always be looking out for the interest of others.  Mostly, that is.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The more you ask people out, the more you get rejected/have to reject, the easier it is to do it/read others.  So if it is a couple of people who don't date all that often, it's going to be a lot of awkward hemming and hawing until one of them gives up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The best tip for ladies OR gentleman is to just not return phone calls.  There isn't any misreading that, and you aren't leading anybody on.   Of course, I'm speaking on would-be-courters that you don't really know.  If it's a friend or something, I guess the situation would be much different.

      Also, when you say, "No thanks," (or, "I have a boyfriend," or "I'm just going to dance with my friends right now, if you don't mind") and they keep persisting, then what do you do? I'm too awkward to get firm about it, and it has led to some  <em>really</em>  uncomfortable situations. The uncomfortable quality of those sorts of interactions probably  <em>should</em>  make me want to be more direct, but instead I end up being indirect in an effort to avoid the whole mess.

      Totally! You can either be really firm and upfront about it-- in which case, it'll turn out that the guy was really nice and sensitive and you'll see his heart break when you shut him down.

      As a dude who regularly talks to girls he does not know (what can I say, I love tits), whenever I get a "thanks but I'm not interested" (or anything from the same ballpark), I usually (if I think it won't come off as too odd) ask what it is that creates the lack of interest. This serves the important purpose of not having "not interested" be the last thing that is said between you two, and is sort of the closing equivalent of an icebreaker, a less abrupt, more conversationalist way of finishing a chat.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Occasionally there is also the secondary purpose of sparking a conversation, which is always nice. Amongst the many "have a boyfriends", "I'm gay" and "no hablo ingles", there is the off chance that a conversation will bloom, and then later, make-outs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the very least, I won't feel like I got shut down, which is a feeling that sucks.

      Yeah I had to shut a guy down a few weeks ago and he pulled that on me-- as if it wasn't horrible enough to have to look at a guy that I could tell liked me and tell him I wasn't feeling it (NOTE: I am not a bitch, I did not use those exact words), but then instead of letting us both go our separate ways and end the awkwardness, he just stood there with puppy dog eyes and wanted me to explain it. Really? You want me to tell you that I am in no way attracted to you? You want me to tell you that I can't look at you without thinking of my oldest friend who I've known since I was 10? You want me to say that your lack of impetus is unattractive, you aren't that good at conversation, I don't like having to shoulder 70% of the conversational burden, and neither your job nor your hobbies are interesting to me? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't even remember what I ended up stammering out. Boys, when you ask this question, do you actually want an answer?

      <em>Seriously</em> .  If you are being forward enough to be picking up women and not in "making friends" mode, be forward enough to walk away.

      But what if it's something stupid that you could easily remedy, like what if you smell like squirrels but because of a childhood incident you have some kind of disability that prevents you from sensing squirrel smells, or you've had toilet paper stuck to your shoe for the past 5 years and no one had the heart to tell you because they thought it was intentional? Then you could just peel it off your shoe and be like "oh man, no  <em>wonder</em>  you didn't wanna go out with me!" and you could both have a good laugh before proceeding to make out.

      yes.  also statistically unlikely is that as a large SUV comes to a stop before a cross-walk where several blind nuns are crossing the street while pushing a baby carriage, some frightened squirrels scamper such that one squirrel each, for a total of four, arrives under each tire of the SUV, resulting in an out-of-control skid on all four tires. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Given enough squirrels, blind nuns, SUVs, and time, sooner or later this should happen.

      Yeah, the only thing worse than being asked that is if, after you have that awful conversation, the guy asks if you could go out just one more time because he really thought there was a connection.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
...What I'm saying is that this is what that guy said to me, after he asked me to explain why I didn't want to date him. And it was bad. And none of you should ever do that. Achillesbow, if you're concerned you smell or whatever, ask a dear friend that's a girl that you don't plan to date. Ask her to be honest and she will tell you the truth, if it's something that can be changed. But it's *never* good news to pull these shenanigans on someone you're dating/being rejected by.

      Well, joking aside, the things you hope to find out could be things that only people whom you approach romantically and who haven't known you for a long time would notice. The way you interact with your friends is completely different. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And seriously, I mean why not ask? I mean all I've heard so far is ladies complaining about how uncomfortable it made  <em>them</em> , but if the girl's already said she's not interested, it can't really get any worse, so what do I care how  <em>she</em>  feels? It's not like I'd want to be 'friends' with her (see above). I guess that means I'm partly motivated by a need for a passive-aggressive form of pathetic faux-revenge, which isn't something to be proud of, but hell, it's true. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for the other argument, that you don't want to hear her reasons because they will make you feel bad, the point is that you  <em>already</em>  feel bad and already assume that she's thinking bad things about you. Plus, I'm the kind of guy who looks at things like 2girls1cup and swap.avi even after people tell me "trust me, you don't wanna see it" because I figure if it's out there, I might as well know. So the same would apply here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess the point is that I think it's legitimate to ask the question if you have reason to suspect that there's some kind of common pattern to your romantic failures that you can't figure out on your own. Like for example, some of you are hella feeding my ego and telling me I'm attractive and whatnot, which is nice and all, and though I may not fully agree I must admit I don't see anything horribly  <em>wrong</em>  with how I look, but then in REAL LIFE it's seriously like I have something stuck to my shoe all the time or like I'm completely ignorant of some rule of conduct that everybody else knows. And I know that by now you're probably looking at this post and thinking I'm a little crazy and over-analytic and maybe that's actually the problem, but I don't think I really express this in everyday life, and if I do, I'd like to know how so I can stop or hide it better or whatever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So yea, I mean obviously if you are too bothered by the question you can always just walk away and choose not to answer it and there's nothing we can do to force you, so I don't see why there's a problem with just asking, but also I think it's a legitimate question that people could consider answering more often and not just dismiss as something ridiculous. This is all theoretical, by the way, because I've never even had the balls to ask that question - I usually just break off all contact immediately so as to forget my shame. But it doesn't mean I wouldn't like to know.

      The amount of things we do or avoid doing to avoid being or making others uncomfortable has crippled gender relations under its weight.  <br/> 
I know we've been raised to be positive, if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all, think about other people's feelings etc, but we (and by we I ESPECIALLY mean the group we seem to have here) seem to spend so much time thinking about the  <em>possible</em>  ramifications of  <em>possible[/] permutations of [i]possible</em>  conversations with people we catch passing glimpses of on public transport, that friendships and life passes us by. All because it's the height of rudeness to be honest about each other, or about ourselves. It's aberrant behaviour to reveal anything true or real about oneself.  <br/>

It's OK to be rude, and it's not rude to be rude.

      In some ways you're right, in some ways you aren't. Even though she's rejecting you, you are effectively torching any chance you might have of ever getting with her in the future. But I go back to what I said about female friends, because though I agree with you on the "nothing to lose" front, if you ask a girl who's just dumped you to tell you why, her mind is still going to be tied up with her carefully worded dumpage and her imminent need to flee. The vast majority of things that might be scaring off a girl, a female friend will be able to see and tell you. Plus, if she's a good friend she's probably seen the way you act around girls anyway. You *are* good-looking so there *may* be something you do socially to turn girls away, I have no idea. But whatever it is, if it is something at all, I bet a good girl-friend will be able to tell you in a much more productive and less painful way for all involved.

      On top of this, sometimes, there is no explanation other than "not interested in you at this present moment in time." <br/>

      This is true as far as it goes, and like someone above said, if you're just going up to girls you don't know and asking them out then you really have no right to inquire further. I'm just thinking that maybe you might owe some explanation to a guy with whom you've hung out on more than several occasions and whom you've gotten to know pretty well and whom you just  <em>maybe</em>  might have been leading on without fully realizing it and he kinda knew that deep down but was still willing to go grocery shopping with you and accompany you to see terrible experimental theater productions where the actors just read out of a book and change roles FOR NO GODDAMN REASON, all because he was desperately smitten by you and hadn't learned his lesson even though this same thing had happened to him at pretty much every stage of his life. Maybe.

      Having never needed to pick up a girl in a bar in my life -- I think you are all way overthinking this whole dating thing.  You can hook up at closing time with the drunkest woman left, sure, but what sort of life is that?  Why not go for quality, someone who has the same interests and who you meet in a non-threatening situation?  And if that doesn't work, online dating works great, at least for older people who can be a bit honest about themselves.  Just be your charming self and never be predatory and she will appear.

Ingredients <br/> 
 <br/> 
    * 1 gallon whole milk <br/> 
    * 4-6 tablespoons lemon juice <br/> 
    * cheese cloth (or a clean, non-terry dishtowel) <br/> 
    * colander <br/> <br/> <br/> Directions <br/> 
 <br/> 
   1. Bring the milk to a boil slowly (not a rolling boil), being careful not the let it burn. On my electric stove I turn it to the dead-middle heat setting. Stir constantly, scraping the sides of the pot to keep the milk from burning to the sides. The milk will foam a little. If it foams too much, scrap it off with a spoon. <br/> 
   2. Add the lemon juice, a little at a time until curds begin to form. Once the curds have completely separated, the whey (the liquid that is left) should appear nearly transparent. <br/> 
   3. Pour the curds into a cheese cloth set in a colander, and let the whey drain away. The whey can be discarded, or used in a recipe that calls for water to be added during cooking. <br/> 
   4. Once the curds have drained and cooled some, tie the cheese cloth around the curds and squeeze out as much remaining liquid as possible. If you are not satisfied that enough liquid has been removed, place the cheese cloth containing the curds between two boards with something heavy on top, and incline the boards slightly so that the liquid drains off. <br/> 
   5. Once all of the liquid is removed, place the cheese in the fridge to cool. Once it feels firm to the touch it is ready to be used in whatever way the recipe calls for. I like to fry it in oil or ghee and eat it as a snack. <br/>

      Mos Def is pretty good (he gets together with a lot of good DJs).  Hell yeah to Girltalk.  [url=www.mickboogie.com]Mick Boogie[/url] has hella good re/mixes to download for free.  I don't know much old stuff but I have been digging on Sloppy White's mixtapes the past week ... if you Google him he has some to download for free too.  While I'm being long-winded: Deltron 3030, the new Public Enemy album, DJ Kicks' DJ mix series (especially Nightmares on Wax's)... these are good albums.  Also checkout Zion I, Outkast, Gnarls Barkley, DJ Spooky, Paul Wall, hella Kool Keith (Dr. Octagon), Haiku D'Etat... (if you feel like it). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003351/https://www.mediafire.com/download.php?tm1ycodbynb">mixtape up here</a> ... it's not all the greatest raps (a lot of chart-tastic stuff) maybe you will like the beats. <br/>

Hip hop is more than rapping: the beat is hella important (i.e. girltalk). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Please pardon the rambling post.

      This is very unrelated but I recently started working at a plant nursery and was stocking a variety of daylily named Bela Lugosi. Seriously. I half wanted to buy it just in case it happened to die.  <br/> 
Instead I might buy a lily named Apricot Sparkles, which kind of sounds like a good name for one of the strippers to which Ray offers money. <br/>

      It occurs to me that in my life it would be more useful to know Irish than French. No-one I meet is ever likely to be impressed by my French (it is terrible, and often theirs is not, and even if it is, they know plenty of people who know it well, but no-one speaks it regularly such that a basic grasp is any use). By contrast, plenty of people in America like to imagine that they are Irish.

      Your sentiment is commendable, but even if you spoke Irish to someone in Ireland itself (never mind an Irish-American) there's a fairly good chance they wouldn't have good enough Irish to answer you properly.  <br/>

Even so, it's so unusual to see someone non-Irish speaking the language that you'd easily achieve your objective of impressing everyone.

      It would be irrelevant to me to try to impress Irish people by speaking Irish, partly because I hardly ever go there, but mostly because Irish people are not being pretentious by being Irish. Also you can detect that I am English without being confused by and Irish I break out.

      A quick note: I find it interesting that the legally Irish folk among us are quick to call the language "Irish" where us  <em>norteamericanos</em>  (or at least where I'm from) for whatever historical reason call it "Gaelic". Gaelic of course also encompassing Scotland and parts of France. History! You fickle beast!

      Actually, the name of Irish in Irish is Gaelige. "Gaelic" in English may refer to that language, or to the distinct celtic language of the Scots.

      Might be because most of the Irish who emigrated to North America did so before the Irish Literary Revival, which closely associated the language with Irish nationalism. Before then the identities of "Gael" and "Irish" were less synonymous - the former applying more to the relatively poor, predominantly Celtic westerners on the island, and it was they who were more likely to head across the Atlantic. Many spoke Irish as a first language, and as "Gael" was the only word that then existed in that language to describe themselves, they stuck to it. Same with "Gaelic" for the language, many would never have used any other word. So it would've made sense that they considered it to be the more appropriate term, and kept it on in the new world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or it might be that Americans are just tryin to sound fancy.

      i went my whole life thinking i was mostly irish. then i found out that red hair and freckles are also rare in ireland. and then i found out my last name is actually scottish, and that i'm more jewish than irish or scottish -- i'm only an 1/8 jewish and my irish greatgrandmother may not have been born in ireland. <br/>

      The two Irish teachers I had in secondary school were both geebags so I'm not too worried whether they'd be happy with me or not, but I do wish my Irish was better. Unfortunately, unlike Des Bishop, I can't just take myself off to Connemara for a whole year to  improve it. Ah well.

      You're probably right, I should just be grateful that the latin alphabet displeases it less than most. Although the way things are going, eventually assetbar won't let anyone speak ill of assetbar without stealing our vowels. And then only the Polish will stand in its way.

      Same exact thing happened recently with a girl I know. The first one I showed her was "Ray gets sort of stoned" and although she laughed heartily, she seemed confused as to why this was so. <br/>

      It took me about 5 years! I'd find individual strips funny but it is asking a lot of someone to read entire story arcs about characters they don't give two shits about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess what would happen is someone would link me to one, I'd find it amusing or strange, and be like "oh okay" and never consider looking again. It took a few discussions with friends who were more into achewood/ discovering it at the same time before we could appreciate it in its full splendour. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It takes time to realise that Philippe is a naive and innocent five year old, that Ray is a hardened veteran of the world, that Roast Beef is brilliant yet withdrawn etc. etc. <br/>

I think that giving an Achewood virgin that example of Roast Beef's depression is like giving a magnum of Mouton Rothschild 1945 to a thirteen year old to go with their hamburger. You think you are doing them a favour but really you are depriving them of great pleasure!

      Is there a difference between being a sex offender and being a sexual offender? <br/>

I imagine in the former case, the word "sex" describes the type of offense, whereas in the latter you are just a sexual person who also happens to offend.

      and my boyfriend is really not an asshole-- he just didn't realize how sick i was and thought i was OK. <br/>

and it's actually karma, sort of. many years ago i met a dude at a party and HIS girlfriend was throwing up in the bathroom but he totally ignored her to keep talking to me. the next night i was blitzed on jd & coke and we made out, contributing to the end of their two year relationship. i am not proud of this.

at one point, made out with a total stranger in someones car. <br/> 
at one point during the strangermakeouts, i realized i was about to throw up so i broke away, said "hold on," opened the car door, got sick on the asphault, closed the car door, turned back to him and said "i think we should go back inside."

      Jack Daniels when I was nineteen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Woke up barefoot three blocks away from my apartment at four in the morning with two broken feet, ripped up clothes (no seat in my jeans anymore), dim memories of jumping fences all night, and one singular memory of socking my friend right in the jaw during rush hour in broad daylight of the city's busiest intersection.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
To be fair, he was just as drunk as I was.

      At the moment, I am staring at a bottle of Montezuma  <em>triple sec</em>  on my shelf.  It will eventually find it's way into either margaritas or Kamikazes.  Share whatever knowledge you have on this subject posthaste, esp. with  <em>Cinco de Mayo</em>  at hand.

      if it was a fire in 'Nam maybe I'd buy that.  Otherwise I'm gonna have to chalk it up to the same level of drama as a hang nail.  After 'Nam, let me tell you, everything else is just a hang nail.  Unless you actually had a hang nail while in 'Nam.  Then it can be a little scarry.

      So, I decided to read through the assetbar comments today, and I think I have finally become one of those people who does not approve of assetbar. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The comments are now just a dicussion forum for people who have assetbar, and the halcyon dreams we once had of comments pertinent to the stip are gone. The comments are not  <em>bad</em>  per se, but I am agin' it all the same. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, if I was really convinced, I wouldn't have bothered to write this, I suppose.

      You mean when people would repost lines from the strip and then other people would say "I say that all the time!" and then retardo would call Onstad gay and Asherdan would get lamed? Yea that was pretty sweet... <br/>

Anyway, I don't think today is a good example. It's basically been a 'let's get to know each other' circle-jerk, which is good because after all this blows over I expect we'll all be a lot more civil to each other. <br/>

      As much as I love trying to be cool on Assetbar, this  <em>is</em>  getting a bit out of hand.  That is why I just made an IRC channel for achewood.  If anyone wants to try this out, join  <strong>#achewood</strong>  on Slashnet.  Hopefully we can move the less relevant ramblings there, and keep assetbar from getting further out of control.  I used to have a nice little .txt file for explaining the intricacies of getting an IRC client and getting it working, but I lost it.  If anyone is interested but is an IRC noob, uhm, I'd be glad to help, just let me know.

      it's not slashdot, but i see your point. <br/> <br/> <br/> Everyone is being real nice now. I don't know if I like it. The anonymity allowed for a freedom to attack and pull apart ideas which is the idea of an argument. If everyone's going to be polite, this is going to stop being funny pretty fuckin' quick.

      I have a feeling that all this civil posting will disappear with the appearance of the next strip. I didn't see the strip til today and it was a nice surprise to see that an outbreak of pleasantness happened over the weekend, but I think it'll be like that time the German and English soldiers played football in No Man's Land one Christmas Eve during WW1 - we'll soon be back to fighting, or dishing out the lames in this case. <br/>

In the meantime, just soak up the lovely atmosphere, and enjoy the unforeseen attractiveness of your fellow Achewood enthusiasts. I know I'm enjoying it; some of you guys are just delicious.

Slashnet hosts some pretty prominent channels(slashdot, sourceforge, Penny-Arcade).  it's free, secure, and pretty robust. <br/>

      Fortune favors the bold, whitey.  My first instinct was to post something like "OMG THOUZANND PSOTS RULZZZ" and then I thought shit I ain't doing a FIRST, but still, it's a threshold that hadn't been reached, and its significance is kind of worth pointing out.  So I took 60 seconds to gather my thoughts and type a more benign marker.   <br/>

      The process that has lead to these 1000 comments is, in my view, very good.  But this number is an aberration, for now.  If you have a three-button mouse and the "middle-click" scroll function working, now is the time to use it. <br/>

      As an avowed Breast Man, I must interject. <br/>

I mind not at all about size.  Taste in shape is the true measure of a Man.   <br/>

My last girlfriend, a gorgeous, red-headed dancer who broke my heart had a pair of perky "tart-and tinies" (Hilarious!) and I loved them.   <br/>

If this is creepy, I am sorry, but I don't want you to think low of Breast Men, or feel bad about yourself, even in any minor way. <br/>

      As per an earlier Assetbar conversation about my tart 'n' tinies, it is not a thing I am actually worried about. I am just a fan of self-deprecating humor, and Assetbar is always talking about boobies, so I end up bringing it up more often and in more detail than is comfortable for anyone but me.

      Be glad, you can find cute bras.  That's the trade-off.  It's pretty hard to find anything bigger than a C-cup that you'd actually want to wear (or have anyone else see).  Manufacturers do seem to be catching on nowadays, although very, very slowly. <br/>

      That's because any woman that is in any way good looking is either there because their boyfriend dragged them or looking for Archies, plushies and/or bringing their kids. So to have a good-looking lady wanting a comic is so ridiculous it catches us for a loop. <br/>

      this is so true.  as someone considered conventionally attractive by the standards set forth by frat boys and lady magazines, the more time I spend on the internet, the more I think I'm an absolute dog for not wearing glasses, having brown hair, or being asian. <br/> 
 <br/> 
really though, no matter how unconventional or conventional your physical appearance is, someone out there has an absolute over-the-top thing for people who look just like you.  your always someone's fetish object, somewhere in the world.  which is...more or less just creepy now that I think about it. <br/>

      What, exactly, defines a fetish? Is it like phobias, in that it has to be irrational? Like, one can be frightened of spiders, yeah, that's a little irrational, but you can't have a crossing-a-highway-in-the-middle-of-the-night phobia, because that's completely rational.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So one can't have a "naked lady" fetish. That's like saying "I have a fetish for sex that I enjoy." (Conceivably, one  <em>could</em>  have a fetish for sex that one explicitly does  <em>not</em>  enjoy.  <em>That</em>  would be irrational.) So where exactly does one draw the line at rational and irrational when it comes to attraction? Certainly, there's physical characteristics (which are being heavily scrutinized at the moment, hem-hem) and emotional and mental characteristics which one person would find compatible and stable were the two to mingle every day life. Oftentimes the division between physical and mental characteristics isn't even there, really - stature of shoulders speaks of strength, the shape of eyes and cheekbones denote sensitivity, feet may, to one person, indicate delicacy, artistry, grace. But any of these attractive characteristics can be canceled out by another singularly unattractive quality, I should think.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
A real fetish, then, cannot be canceled out. It doesn't matter who happens to be, say, naked but wearing tennis shoes and socks, if it's your fetish you're immediately attracted. It's irrational in that it persists against all reasonable indications of character or physicality.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, that's my small thesis about the line between a fetish, which is a minor detail that forces the attractee to ignore all major ones, and taste, in which physical and mental characteristics are translated back and forth by the viewer to denote stability, growth, and "beauty." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also there's just the really good fuck. Which doesn't even need a thesis really, because one can't say enough for it.

      What you are describing is either preference or kink, depending on where you go with it, but as far as I know (and I am a regular Savage Love reader who has also been interviewed in Playboy for my advice column) a fetish is a sexual attraction to an *object,* independent of its actual use in sex. I.e. you're kinky if you like your girlfriend to wear those tennis socks and shoes, but you have a fetish if just looking at the those socks and shoes turns you on, even when she's not wearing them. Etc. etc. etc.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Between my picture, me talking about my ass a little ways up the page and now this, I'm feeling mighty exposed! It'll be good when tomorrow we go back to being pictures that live inside the internet and not human beings with faces.

      <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Imagine going through highschool always being with two dudes who autimatically make you third pick at best? And this "at best" scenario means the rest of the room is like cave trolls or something.<br/>
<br/>
It was not good times. I describe my dating experience back then as being a sort of scavenger, picking off the weak and the foolish.</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Yeah. All three of my best friends are hot and either D cups or double Ds. (Mine tend more towards vowelage.) My experience in high school was similar to yours...</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
For me, the grass was no greener on the other side of the fence. My best friend was jealous of the attention I got, and yet I was mostly unaware of it. For you see, what females took for unflappable aloofness and raw, primal class-clownism was really such powerful cluelessness about human interaction that I couldn't even  <em>display timidity</em>  with body language, let alone flirt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All I knew was that I meekly burned for the shy, bookish girls, and yet I only ever got asked out by the outgoing, popular ones, whom I summarily turned down. (I mean, what could I  <em>do</em>  on a date with that cheerleader?  <em>We would have nothing to talk about.</em> ) <br/> 
 <br/> 
So basically, I had the same set of problems in high school as every nerdy guy.

      naw was not giving up, just acknowledging that i have considered self-deprecation. it is a thing to do when a lady has low self-esteem. the key, however, is having a sense of humor about you when you do it. <br/>

      eatmorekix I think you especially are super pretty and have lovely big eyes!

      I had meant to use my "suit" picture, for which I created a separate pogo2 account, but Ass-bar won't let pogo2 post anymore, so the joke is screwed. See, way up top, some dudes thought I looked like I cold run for office, hence the camapaign ... not sure why I want to clear this all up, but it would have been better if I stuck with the suit pic.  Oh well, no one will ever read this anyway amongst over 2,000 posts that day the earth stood still and hands went to faces.  *Sigh*

And I actually got the joke, after taking a moment to visually confirm you were not in fact Mike Gravel.

      well it was really neat at first seeing everyone's photo but now the novelty is wearing off, and the photos are actually, some of them, most of them, blurry masses of pixels that express less visual content than a well done avitar.  I think that the mind must be programmed to absorb just tons and tons of information from a person's face... when that face is static and never flinching, never changing expression, then I think the mind kind of just stops seeing anything there at all.  These damn face avitars need higher resolution, and if Assetbar won't allow that, well then, the face avitars need to be rotated daily to a new expression or angle of view.
