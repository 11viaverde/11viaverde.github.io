      Where is the light that I thought I was promised? <br/> 
Where is the truth, and the hope and the way? <br/> 
I've lost my footing, my spine, my eyes, <br/> 
Everything keeps slipping away. <br/> 
Where is the storybook ending? <br/> 
The love, the joy, the laughter? <br/> 
Is all there is just nothing at all? <br/> 
Is there anything that matters? <br/> 
Is this all we get for our lives? <br/> 
And after everything, why is it still so lonely? <br/> 
So blank, so dry, so numb? <br/> 
Are we brought up just to crack and bleed out, <br/> 
Unravel, coming undone? <br/> 
Is this all we get? <br/> 
Is this all we get for our lives?

      Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more, <br/> 
For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead, <br/> 
Sunk though he be beneath the wat'ry floor, <br/> 
So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed, <br/> 
And yet anon repairs his drooping head, <br/> 
And tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore, <br/> 
Flames in the forehead of the morning sky: <br/> 
So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high.

      Same here. I'd never been irrationally angry at a dead person before, but after the first punch-to-the-gut burst of surprise, it was pretty much 'What the FUCK, you  <strong>asshole</strong> ." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sadly for DFW, this is probably the exact same emotion I will experience if the cartoon cat does not come back from the dead.

      Goddamn. Last night I dreamed I was critiquing DFW to his face, telling him his work had really fallen off this year.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then some guy told me, "Man, you can't harsh on a dead man."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then I was sad. Then the cops came.

All like never being able to notice when you fall asleep or, for that matter, have been asleep except for when you wake up.

      While CH surely has something else going on here he certainly didn't spend the time to do any proper publicity. He learned about the lash and Beef was in bed and dying that very night. I mean, Ray got an invitation, but he was having to rush across town just to be able to get there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess partly because Onstad didn't want to do another series of strips of build-up right after his last series sort of built up and then went nowhere leading into this, but still... this feels kinda half-assed. <br/>

      Ray dies of brain injuries. Teodor is eaten, alive and screaming, by coyotes. Cornelius is taken away by the police, and put in a nursing home to live out his last days, alone in his small single bed. The cheerful and officious nurses deny him alcohol, tobacco, and any book not published by Reader's Digest. Lyle's heart bursts in a fog of amphetamines and Tennessee whiskey. Philippe goes back to live with his mother, to learn why homosexuality and Catholicism makes Jesus cry. Emeril moves to Florida with a new girlfriend and Spongebath never really laughs again.

The day they cut her loose, she goes down to The Smoke to drown her sorrows. By the time she leaves it's dark out, as she turns a corner her headlights flash across The Dude and Catastrophe, a dark spot among the brightly lit storefronts. The empty and unlit windows suddenly seem to swallow some part of her, a part she thought would always be safe with Cornelius. She bursts into tears, horrible, heaving, sobbing tears, and at the next intersection her cabriolet is pulverized by a speeding truck. <br/>

 Cornelius waits, back at the home. He knows she's not legally allowed to visit him now, and that the staff intercept all the letters he knows she must write him. Still, he waits. He'll see her again.

      I like Cat Power a lot, but there is  <em>no</em>  reason to listen to her cover of that song instead of the original.  <em>None.</em> <br/>

      You know, you're probably right.  It's just that Achewood has been doing something for me for a long time that it's not doing for me with this arc... Achewood's been hit-or-miss with me lately and it's very frustrating.  (Apology accepted.)  Anyway, carry on...

      Onstad is a genius, There have been so many times when achewood has made me laugh more than anything else (the exceptions being a couple of moments from peep show and alan partridge) so I hate to do the man down. But I personally (as an anonymous internet dickwad, slumped over a keyboard pontificating in my hipster t-shirt and ironic beard)am not enjoying this arc.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But that's ok, nothing is perfect, and as the peanut butter warehouse owner said, "you've got to take the rough with the smooth". Achewood hasn't jumped the shark with this storyline, It's been jumping the shark since day one and that's why I (and so many other anonymous internet dickwads) love it. I suppose what I'm trying to say with this ramble is, Let the man work.

      Hi, friends. I'm new on assetbar but have been reading since puberty (or so). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think Roastbeef is the most dignified Achewood resident. I hope this isn't his actual end. Maybe CH is using RB's death not as performance art, but as some weird alchemy experiment. Maybe CH can't die by any other way than the Lash, which is why that psychic lady had him on speed dial. Because, seriously, were I CH, I would want to die.

      Korean has a pretty small alphabet (similar to English, I believe) they just combine them into characters by stacking them.  So it's relatively easy to recognize. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The katakana's the only thing really separating Chinese and Japanese, unless you understand one of them.  So I just tend to notice Chinese being denser.

      This must be a matter of concern to zoophiles. There is just no etiquette for being caught screwing a cat. The only thing I can think of to even slightly salvage the situation is look down and say 'What the deuce, this isn't the Guaranteed Honky-Tonk Style Blowjob I ordered. Get me room service!' But I feel even that would be unlikely to make it significantly less awkward unless the person who caught you was both a massive fan of Achewood and deep-down pretty tolerant of cat shagging.

      I had a book as a child that taught me innumerable jokes that were in bad taste, vicious and rude schoolyard songs, interesting bits of trivia, and the like. It was like an entire childhood that may not actually exist that much anymore compiled into book form and definitely of use to nerdy children.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kind of like the liberal arts version of "The American Boy's Handy Book". Who here did not love the hell out of that? All teaching you how to make crossbows and boats and such. Seems like that whole "Dangerous Book for Boys" is trying to do the same thing, but if it doesn't teach you how to build a snow fort, a blowgun, and train a dog I'm not certain what value it has... aside from not assuming you have a ready source for barrel staves and whalebone.

      "The dead man lay, as dead men always lie, in a specially heavy way, his rigid limbs sunk in the soft cushions of the coffin, with the head forever bowed on the pillow. His yellow waxen brow with bald patches over his sunken temples was thrust up in the way peculiar to the dead, the protruding nose seeming to press on the upper lip. He was much changed and grown even thinner since Peter Ivanovich had last seen him, but, as is always the case with the dead, his face was handsomer and above all more dignified than when he was alive. the expression on the face said that what was necessary had been accomplished, and accomplished rightly. Besides this there was in that expression a reproach and a warning to the living. This warning seemed to Peter Ivanovich out of place, or at least not applicable to him. He felt a certain discomfort and so he hurriedly crossed himself once more and turned and went out of the door%u2014too hurriedly and too regardless of propriety, as he himself was aware." <br/>

Listen buddy... you see up top where that dude who is on the global ignore list made a post, and then I made a post telling him he's on the global ignore list, and then he made a post thanking me for being considerate enough to let him know this fact?  Do you see that?  It doesn't take a fucking rocket scientist to show a little consideration and empathy for another human being.  It doesn't.  If AIU can do it, maybe other people can too.  Maybe you are some asshole who only thinks about herself, and that's fine, really it is, and really hopefully you get terminally run over by a considerate bus one of these days, because hey, if you ever do notice that hey, the inventory system is wrong, obviously you're the sort of asshole who isn't going to say "I should fix it in case it causes some inconvenience for someone."  You're the kind of asshole who walks past a leaking hole in a dike and says "hey it's not my problem."  You're the kind of asshole who would work in airport security and not try to bring attention to inherent flaws in the system which you notice (assuming your asshole self is even capable of recognizing a systemic flaw when it jumps up out of it's seat and smacks you in the forehead with a 2x4)...   see there's a reason why we have security systems...  these systems actually do, when they work, provide a certain measure of convenience and even... wait for it.... <em>security</em>  for people.... and likewise, an inventory system actually provides a certain measure of convenience for people....  sure no one is going to die if the inventory system shows something in stock when it's not supposed to... but it's the same fucking concept... same concept... if you're too stoned out of your mind to understand the one concept, then you're too stoned to understand the other concept.  you sir lack empathy, you lack understanding, you are a miserable piece of shit that gets so severely stuck in the sphincter/rectum of humanity that we have to use  <em>medical procedures</em>  to remove it.  And remove you we should, because you are a cancer, destined to contribute as much as possible to the failure of humanity in any endeavor of which you are a part.  I hope you get run over by a bus.

      Daaaaamn AIU, YOU CRAZY!  I read all of that, but I'm ignoring most of it, and you know why.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
All I'll say is that I'm a person who most likely has more experience and knowledge of these kind of inventory systems than you.  I can guess a few of the reasons why they don't change the inventory; I'll let you in on one likely big reason: "loss prevention" and the institutional measures involved - the ability to alter digital inventory is severely restricted at a lot of stores because "most loss is from employees."  Make it too easy to alter inventory, and you start to lose control of the ability to track loss. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, there are certain levels of actual philosophy behind this.  Stores know this is a problem, of course: it's a calculated risk to get you to the store, most likely.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I worked at a store years ago that had started doing this, and I knew it was not a good thing to do with the way they ran the inventory overall, the latter being something they were protocol-wise unlikely to change and technologically unable to do without a big overhaul of the system.  Remember, this is corporate America: for most companies, it's a constant balancing act between "good customer service" and shareholder demands, with the latter the overwhelmingly important factor to management. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll shut up now before I go on sociopathic rant.

      Even if AIU/choco is crazy, he's not necessarily wrong. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In January, Costco had a big sale on plasma TVs, and it was my wife's birthday, so I finally decided to get one.  I called the store ahead of time, they said they had several in stock.  I drove a half an hour, they had none in stock.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
They told me the next store had some in stock.  I drove an hour, they had none in stock.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
They said the next store had five.  I drove another half hour, they had one.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the second store, the guy told me they knew the TVs were missing at all these stores--corporate had sent out an e-mail about it.  But they didn't tell me when I asked, "Should I drive to your store to get this specific item?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know they need to track loss, but they do not need to mislead customers. They should flag "errors" in their system so that floor reps can tell people not to bother driving an hour out of their way, but management can still investigate disappeared merchandise.  This would be easy to do, and would improve service and inventory control at the same time.

      All good points, but again, you're hoping for great customer service from large companies that ultimately thrive on volume.  Even when ideas make sense, and would ultimately make it easier for customers to buy things and give the company money, new procedures/systems are costly to implement, and, in my experience, companies seem hesitant to do this.  Even when they do, it always seems like one new problem is created when one is fixed.  I know, because I was always finding faults at the store I worked for and bitching and moaning, as well.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Logically, there should be an end, but in practice inventory is one neverending headache.  At big stores, something will always be wrong, and it will annoy somebody.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I even worked in a much-better-than-average retail environment, but the lesson I learned is that I will never walk into a big retail store and be AIU-style pissed off after I found out they didn't have what I thought they had.  It's the nature of the beast: big volume, low-paid employees, sloppy customers...it's a recipe for disappointment.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Actually, I'm going to put a big part of this on the employees.  Any good employee will know the pratfalls of the system.  When I had a customer ask me if something was at another store, I'd tell them "they're  <em>supposed</em>  to have a copy, but it could obviously be an order for someone else, it could be out of place, could be a glitch...you want me to call and check?"  And I would make sure the person at the other store went and found it and then asked them to hold it before I told the customer it was there. <br/>

holy fucking shit it's my friend who's getting his MBA at Duke not me.  forgot all this bullshit.

      pratfall?  is that a word?  a typo?  or one of those things where your brain sort of picks a spelling for you without you thinking about it?  there should be a word for that latter phenomenon and it should be an anamatopea ... however the fuck that's spelled. <br/> 
 <br/> 
yeah you're totally right... it's inherent in the system...  a free market will do crazy things like adopt a keyboard layout standard that has been designed to be as difficult as possible to use.  (qwert)  <br/> 
 <br/> 
but I'll tell you what... if more people got AIU pissed at shit, shit would get fixed...  people would have to start finding root causes... and the root cause of an inventory glitch is probably a whole mix of social problems including low paid employees and employees treated like shit and discouraged for 'taking ownership' in anything they do... but if people could get AIU-pissed about an inventory glitch, then maybe they could get AIU-pissed at other problems as well, and eventually the pressure would have to wind it's way through the system until it pressed on the root causes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wonder if all those postal employees going postal ever had any effect on the post office corporate culture...???  it was a culture that was severely out of whack as far as corporate cultures go...  I've seen first hand how cultures in a union shop can especially get way out of whack due to lack of free market mechanisms...  in a more free market, employees say 'fuck this shit' and they leave, and the company sometimes has to react by not treating employees like shit as much as it does, but in a union shop employees say 'I'm making $10 an hour more than I can make anywhere else, and I don't have to work that hard, I better stay' and so they put up with the company treating them like shit, and the company says 'labor costs are way too high, and the union has too much power, we need to keep the pressure on to increase turn over and to use the pressure as a bargaining chip' and so the company goes way out of it's way to treat the employees like shit... all of which really increases the statistical probability that some employees will go postal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
yeah I guess going postal is a really extreme reaction that's not likely to effect root causes.  But if every time a customer was confronted with a situation where they were inconvenienced with something being out of stock, if that customer shoved a rack of merchandise to the floor, you can bet that store would get it's act together yesterday.  how many customers would it take shoving a rack of inventory to the floor, in a 4 week period, for the store to change it's inventory practice?  Maybe I should stage a happening...

      My parents once called a Canadian Tire to see if an item was in stock and to hold it.  It was, and they headed to the store, picked it up, took it to the checkout. <br/> 
The clerk said, "I think someone called to reserve that" which demonstrates some level of communication that I had not expected.   <br/>

      While it's within the personality of Beef I have to say I'm a bit surprised that he just goes along with it. He was reading the primer and thus knows that he is not specifically doomed, but there are hastening triggers that must be avoided. Even more he can nullify the Lash. True, he didn't get to read the crucial piece of information, but he could easily mention this to CH, maybe get another copy of the book. He doesn't have to hasten himself, but he does anyway without a word. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's true to Beef's nature, but it still doesn't sit right entirely.

      Awhile back, daedala_x said <br/> 
 <br/> 
"ditto. i've gone through some bad times. sometimes i get the same feeling when i read beef, and then immediately after i get sort of angry because beef's depression is somewhat of a gimmick. he hangs out with a group of dudes who involve him in all sorts of hijinks. some of them are willing to spare him a lung, build him a glass chamber with incubator arms just so he'll hang out, or set everything up like Cheers, and it's like dang, beef, how are you still gonna be depressed? what you got to be depressed about? you're just plain ungrateful. if i had a kind and funny lady to take care for me and a bunch of doggs who understood and accommodated my strange cares (i mean yea they rag but it is out of Fondness) i would be hella satisfied." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I agree. He moved out of his grandmother's house, he's married to a woman who loves him and accepts his faults, but none of that seems to have done anything for his self worth in the long run. Obviously, Beef can't be a perfectly happy and well adjusted individual, but he doesn't have to be a total mess either.

      These things are true, but let us think about Roast Beef a little more. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Remember when Roast Beef finally made a good chunk of money? A stewardess tried to please him orally and take it from him whilst breaking up his relationship with Molly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Remember when he was just trying to be a happy go lucky pot smoker? Drove a golf cart off a cliff. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Remember when he got shot? Yeah. Multiple times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Remember when he lived with his Mom and Grandmother? Horrible. <br/>

Also, beef is smart. The saying "Ignorance is Bliss" is very, very true.

      That's true, but I still find it hard to sympathize with a character who's depressed for no reason, especially since given how much screen time (page time?

      That's the thing about depression though: it's not rational. Depression can hit you just as hard when you should be happiest as it can when things are going badly for you in life. Bad things can trigger bouts of depression, but if you have it bad it can crop up at any time, for almost any reason.

      Oh, absolutely. That is his character. But I think that there can at least be a little contentment in his life, and that he can be a mess without being a total mess.

      Keep in kind that I was focusing solely on Beef, not real people with his problems. It isn't just that it doesn't make sense, realistic or not, it's that if it's inherent, then he'll never be able to work past his problems, denying his best opportunity for character development.

      While one can get tired like that (and by 'one' I mean me) the planet stays populated because of survival reflex.  We're not designed to literally roll over and die just because some authority guy says us we can.  Quite the opposite. <br/>

      If you're actually 22, statistically you shouldn't know the first thing about tired, although there are obviously aberrations among those whom life has severely beaten. I'm guessing you're not really in that lot either. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Speaking personally, I am, or was, and in hindsight it is far better to be hammered by the slings and arrows when you're young, because you have that energy and resilience, if nothing else. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You, child, are still riding an upward, illusive rocket of blinding life force just starting its 2nd stage. <br/> <br/> <br/> As for any authority guy, he's that lone spectator in seat 1-Z.

      This beautifully rendered treasure most recently unearthed by time shows that Gladi8orrex is been rather ailed. Whither he was still ill at the time of writing is thus-far uncertain. With his usage of 'been', Glad could either have meant the sickness had already passed, or that he was still "under the weather," but this mystery is solved with the next sentence where he uses 'have' in the present tense, showing the reader that he was indeed sick. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Exactly how ill he was, however, is hard to figure, as the word 'sine' precedes the word 'flu', which could be construed one of two ways. The first is that he has contracted the famed illness of his time, The Swine Flu, which he was possibly infected by an improperly cooked pork-chop or possibly from another person, though such transmission was found to be rare. The second way to translate the word 'sine' is the mathematical term, which refers to the the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse of an angle. In vary sparingly-reported incidents, students or others too busied with trigonometric functions have become ill due to exposure to the toxic natures of formulas and variables, coming down with what is called "Sine Flu." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The author then begins to ponder his own mortality in the first half of the next sentence. This is a callback to his previous penning, "i fucked up guys." His mistake must have been dire, as when he continues, he demands that the reader tells "Em", Gladi8orrex's favorite great aunt's shortened name, which he turned into a term of endearment for the general public, "Ma Story", which is a 1953 movie about an addict mother's slow decline of health and her offspring's coming-to-terms with her death, which occurs at the end of the picture. It had a no star cast and meager budget so when it was slated for a release the weekend after Stalag 17's, it failed miserably. That Glad would refer to such a film is again but the tiniest glimpse into the author's mind, and perhaps a suggestion that the reader should take a glance at the flick and suffer as he and Ma do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Truly, Gladi8orrex was a man. One that any of us could have known and admired. Showing his weaker side in such a manner is quite the vulnerable gesture. Only an incredible sort of person would be capable of letting so many in and gently letting out his emotions. His understandings. And, yes, his fears.

Also, zombie turtle boy it is. Now that I am freed from my puzzlement I would hasten to add that I do actually  <em>like</em>  Glad's icon. "It sfits", as it were. Privately, I shall continue to think of it as some kind of Heath Ledger dwarf.

      Ray currently has a small paperback embedded in his sweetbreads. I truly hope that no-one's going to be judging him for what he does in the next three weeks or so. Whether that's deserting a dying friend or pissing on one of the nurses while shrieking the first verse of "Frere Jacques" over and over.
