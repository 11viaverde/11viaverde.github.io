      I would say something about the paralell between Onstad's reclamation of "splut" from Garfield and the ongoing debate in the hip-hop community over whether "nigga" reinforces or destroys racial hatred, but then I'd be a pretentious dickhole <br/>

      Also, whenever pies hit Garfield in the face in the comic strip, they go SPLUT.  Jim Davis once wrote a week's worth of strips where nothing happened, except pies hitting Garfield in the face and going SPLUT, a phenomenon Garfield referred to as "splut week," and everyone else referred to as "Jim Davis writes a week's worth of strips in five minutes week."

      Yeah reading Achewood really makes you realize how lazy these daily newspaper comic writers are.  Every day they're all: "Can't sleep Dagwood?  Why don't you make yourself a sandwich," when Onstad can average five jokes/strip and literally advance the English language.

      Yes but do you think any of the jokes in here would be allowed within 100 yards of your average newspaper. I seriously doubt it. <br/> 
Plus syndicated dailies have to all be standalone in case a reader only gets the paper on saturday and misses the other six issues. The effect is that you are unable to develop characters beyond the simplest of stereotypes. Despite that they still have to keep the same characters to maintain the brand and ensure its still recognisable to the casual reader. So Jim for example couldn't get rid of Garfield and write about a duck with bad manners instead. If he did then the reader wouldn't know it was by the guy who did Garfield. <br/>

      Not once in all my years of using a mac have I ever had to find, install, or even know what the hell a driver is. A mac will just assume you don't know what the hell you're doing and take care of everything before you even figure out there was a snag. This only becomes a problem if you do know what the hell you're doing and want to tinker.

      The only time I had to install a driver was during an ill-advised period of trying to use an off-brand super crappy pen tablet thing that was made in Taiwan.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It never worked. But other than that- yeah, no fussin' with drivers on my Mac.
