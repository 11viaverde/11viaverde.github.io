      I saw a soft core porn in cinemax that involved wearing a police hat in the shower. I don't know what it was called, but I'll describe the plot so maybe you can find it; There was this cop, and a woman in the shower decided to have sex with him.

      Sounds like a pretty nuanced plot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's a porno starring Cytherea in which she wears a police hat. Because she's playing a policewoman, or a security guard, or somesuch. I dunno, I usually fast forward through the beginning.

      Heh! This reminds me of a dream I had about getting rich from writing the plot of one such porn. A woman takes men in her back seat dressed in frilly pink things and the dicks of the guys keep getting bigger, until she found the biggest dick, and they fucked and got married. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that was the same night I dreamed about falling in love, but I can't be sure entirely.

      I know no woman who wears frilly pink things, but that would be great if I did. I don't think I could tell her this particular anecdote, though Not until we're married, at least.

      But... why? Have you trued viewing it from the other point of view? Let's say Onstad /is/ gay- how uncomfortable do you think the posts make him feel? Incredibly. The place many gay people put themselves in is not necessarily one which they want to be "freed" from. Just because you've eaten something before doesn't mean that you want every person on your message board to know that. Onstad hasn't specifically denied he's gay- although it's assumed with the wife and child- so why are you pushing it? And from the other possibility, Onstad not being gay... wouldn't that be incredibly irritating? What if you ran a comic, and someone, without fail, on every comic with straight romance in it, asked you if you were straight?

      And yes, a whole bunch of people have already discussed the fact that a guy can be married to a woman and still be gay, but I think it's not fair to make the default assumption that he isn't in love with the woman he married just because he writes about homosexuality.  I've written poems and stories from the point of view of various people/entities including my grandmother, a frog, and an eleven-year-old girl in the year 2075.  If somebody started posting things about me every 5 minutes saying "hollis is an adolescent grandmother frog from the future, everybody!  It's okay to admit it hollis, we love you!"  I would have to say that person had an incomplete concept of separating the art from the artist.

      Amen, hollis. Retardo, you claim you're all about the analysis and discussion of art, but all you seem to do is leave ridiculous comments that simply urge Mr Onstad to "come out". You rarely seem to discuss anything at all. I notice you never urge him to come out on the many strips that refer to heterosexual sex. <br/>

      Good point!  Especially since Onstad also went to Stanford, home to what we call the "Duck Syndrome" -- on the surface you're just floating along, but under the water, you're paddling furiously.  I think that if this fear of exposure theme *is* a reflection of something in Onstad's life, it's likely that it reflects the issues he faces as an artist, or that we all face as human beings.  Whether or not we're "out" regarding our sexuality, we're all fronting in one way or another.  And we're scared people are going to know.

      Retardo, I was actually taught in all my high school and college education to never equate an artist as wholly represented by a work, because that work will change over time, unless revised periodically (Jacques Derrida, anyone?). "Hidden meaning," especially that which relates anything to the artist directly, is little to discuss except MAYBE at an elementary level. I know this all too personally because I only frustrated my classmates and professor when I asked how Walt Whitman came up with certain metaphors in Leaves of Grass; "You simply don't know the artist's intent." <br/> 
 <br/> 
And also, you remind me of a friend of mine who also spoke frequently in statistics, particularly the Kinsey statistic that all men are at least 10% homosexual. What's unusual is that he was obviously confused about his sexuality to the point that he would declare his enlightened homosexuality one year, be gone for months, reappear with an enlightened sense of heterosexuality, and start over again, so his "homosexuality-percentage" was apparently indeterminate.  Maybe, and perhaps like you, he used statistics as something pseudo-reliable, but all I could be reminded of was Disreali's quote made famous by Mark Twain that there's "three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics." Percentages of anything are usually just trying to market something, which can also be an idea. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, since sexuality is a strong concern on this thread, here's my two cents: people, really, should not feel so worried about relying on sexuality to define themselves, and those who aren't comfortable with others' sexuality, gay or straight, should, in my humble opinion, mind their own damned business.

      The comparatively small number of strips that reference or deal with homosexuality tend to display it as slightly grotesque (the gay porn sideline, for instance).  The strip is populated entirely with male anthropomorphic animals that not even furries would find attractive.  If anything, Onstad has the same latent homophobia that any true creative heterosexual would display under these circumstances (and given free rein of their artistic talent.)  The presence of extremely minor gay characters in an artist's work isn't anything like evidence that the artist is gay.  That assumption is kind of revolting.

      I think it's admirable that you've defended yourself when so many people have resorted to crude insults.  A lot of your comments that I've seen are lamed unfairly.  You  <strong>are</strong>  thoughtful, and your desire to pay good deeds forward is very kind.    <br/>

As hollis suggested above, I think it would be a good idea to talk to Chris through private correspondence.  He'd be more likely to respond, and you could get your ideas across without ruffling as many feathers.

      Sir, your point is valid. Mr. Onstad is right to conceal his true inclinations with a wife and child, for in these days, an unmarried fellow in his thirties would certainly cause many an askance look and raised eyebrow in St. James's Park or on Mayfair. I do not know what the twentieth century will bring, but I suspect such mollies as Christopher will be doomed to remain incognito for fear of society's judgments. <br/>

      I work at a toy store that sells cheap, very poor quality guitars.  The fixtures for the display models have a bar across the neck to secure it.  The thought of a capo kept indefinitely on the neck was so foreign to me that i assumed it was one of those for some reason.
