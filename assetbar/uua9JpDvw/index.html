      KK so first up, sorry for threadjacking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad has posted that he's having a fundraiser. Well, that's one thing. But the fanflow is also a money-spinner, and I'd rather see two people happier than one, and I think keeping Achewood alive is a worthy cause. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So: the first reply to this post gets a year's fanflow subscription. I'll make the account, buy the subscription, delete my credit card information (!) and then hand it over to you. K? K.

      What is the best manly wine?  I am leaning toward Shiraz, partially because it sounds (literally) manly and partly because it is my favourite.

      How do you define manly? I couldn't pare a wine with something like changing the radiator on your car, or watching cage fighting if that's how you mean manly. <br/> 
That's what beer is for. Guinness, or perhaps Sheaf Stout where you are.  <br/> 
If you are thinking more along the lines of James Bond in a towel type manly you can't go wrong with Cabernet Sauvignon, (which I am drinking now, out of a coffee cup. Not for manliness per se, but I'm lazy) Zinfandel (Ray likes that too)Or even you're beloved Shiraz. (Syrah to many of us.) <br/> 
The important thing is that the wine is able to display some nuance, some complexity. It should change a bit as it spends time in your glass, it ought to have a color and a smell, it should remind you of things. If you spill some it needs to leave a stain. Not like that awful Sauvignon Blanc.  <br/> 
That is dog shit.

      I'm all for broadening my horizons. What whites would you suggest? All the whites I've tried either taste vinegary (esp. Sauv blanc) or like juice (Riesling, Riesling-GW, Chablis, Pinot Grigio). What I mean to say is that I have only had a few, and they were not to my liking.

      I'm going to preface this with an apology for getting all wine-poncey in all of your faces. <br/> 
The fact that you find Chablis, which is usually the least fruity of the Burgundy Chardonnays, too juice-like suggests that you might enjoy one of the sparser wines, like an Alberino or a Bordeaux Blanc. Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blac can produce a wide range of wines, so wouldn't write off either grape without having a taste around. German and Alsatian Riesling is personal favourite of mine, but I see what you mean about the juice; they tend to be extremely fruity. <br/> 
I suppose if you've tried a fair bit of white wine with an open mind and you honestly don't enjoy any of it then good luck to you. I just disagree with closing yourself off to potential experiences because of misconceived notions of masculinity. For what it's worth (and I know I'm not really old enough to pull this off) when I was your age I found white wine a bit of a chore. I'm not going to claim that a taste for whites is a sign of sophistication just because I gained it a bit later in life than my taste for red wine, but its always a good thing to to seek to broaden your horizons, as you say. <br/> 
Anyway, I'm drunk (on beer and scotch) and I apologise for acting like I've got any wisdom to impart on this topic. Drink whatever the damn hell you like, and the odd think that you think you don't like just to make sure.

      Lord, I could go off on this subject, and I may yet. The evening is young and the bottle mostly full. <br/> 
There is quite a bit of crap wine in the world, and as <br/> 
much misinformation.  <br/> 
Mock, you may have had one of those jug wines that get labeled as 'chablis' here is the states. They resemble a 7-up left open on the sill for a weekend more than anything else. <br/> 
I would suggest finding a small wine merchant in your area if possible. The big stores are full of the mass produced wines that all aim for the boring middle and hit it squarely.  <br/> 
Talk with them about what you have liked and what you have not. If you are lucky you will find someone that can point you towards something to your liking. <br/> 
If you can go to a tasting, do. <br/> 
Not one at a local winery, or only featuring one type of wine or any producer. Something more general. <br/> 
Don't worry about the wine snobs or not having any 'knowledge'. It's about exposing yourself to as many types of wine as possible and finding what you like. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Random purchasing at the store is a crapshoot, but as such you can get lucky. Avoid cute labels and names, <br/> 
if a winemaker doesn't take their product seriously neither should you. <br/> 
Anyway, I'm drinking something right now that deserves my attention, and I hope that you find the same.

      Damn, I kick myself for not mentioning this sooner. <br/> 
For anyone that wants to explore wines in a lovely, low pressure environment, go to a restaurant that serves food that you enjoy and that serves several wines by the glass. Sit at the bar and speak with your bartender and inquire if you could order some appetizers and taste the wines that they serve by the glass. Of course you'll have to pay for this, and I wouldn't suggest that you do this at a busy time, but on a quiet afternoon or weekday evening I'll bet you can find some place to do this. Plus, your bartender will know a bit about what other people enjoy, and what wine would go with what dish. O.K. public service announcement over... I go back to my drink now.

      okay it sounds like I've been misled with the Chablis, it was the Taylor (USA) one that i think is sold to restaurants in boxes. I guess I'll poke around with whites some more; I do like how they taste with the fish I catch so maybe I'll find something I like. Thanks for the tips guys, I had a feeling there would be good winos here.

Food poisoning is a bitch that makes you go "wow, trying to impress people by eating barely cooked steak kinda doesn't work so well when you're in a fetal position on the floor in your own vomit."

      That's theoretically correct but the temperatures would be extreme. I know that surgical insturments contaminated by prions will not be sterilised by conventional treatment in an autoclave (which heat to over 121 degrees Celsius according to wikipedia). Bear in mind that that is just to sterilise the external surface, whereas with a piece of beef you would need to get the steak cooked right through. There have been some experiments done using high pressure cooking that would sterilise prions in mechanically recovered meat used for hot dog on an industrial scale, but short answer no, you will not reliably sterilise infected beef by cooking it, even if it is well done to the point of being inedible. <br/> 
That being said, prions have never been found in food grade muscle meat, so while a steak of grass fed beef that has been properly slaughter and butchered might have some theoretical degree of risk it is pretty minimal compared to the risk of choking on it, or getting run over while going the shop to buy it.

It gives me an image of a totally automated slaughterhouse like a Krispy Kreme factory, and the doughnuts (cows) that fall off the track or get stuck in the cracks are swept up by robots at night and pushed into the meat recovery blender in the floor drain...

      No. They aren't alive, you can't kill them. If you literally eliminate the nutritional content by reducing the steak to ash, yes, you've eliminated them, but they now taste terrible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The actual incidence of finding mad cow disease in steaks intended for human consumption is to the best of my knowledge non-existent. In addition, over a half million cows slaughtered and sold as food have been found to have mad cow disease, and it has spread to less than 200 people in the last 21 years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So sure, cook that steak well-done, waste your time, and have something that doesn't taste delicious. Or, just buy local, organic, grass-fed cow meat, cook the steaks rare, and PARTY ON LITTLE DUDE.

      actually I was saying medium, not well done, with a decent marinade (red wine and vinegar, soak it from the morning to the evening, cook it in butter and garlic...) <br/>

in my opinion it is superior to rare steak, if done well, with a firm yet tender texture and strong, complimentary flavours.

      I think that it does hold up to repeated viewings, but it is diminished by its success.  That is, all of the film's (prodigious) contributions to the art of cinema have been adopted and have now become the base upon which other artists build.  The narrative itself is good, but not phenomenal (and doesn't resonate the same in 2010). <br/>

As others were speculating on the last strip, perhaps the High School Atrocity Van will become Achewood's most unfinished arc? A giant shaggy dog story whose conclusion is half explained by some background dialogue a year hence.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm okay either way. I'd like to know what happened (and I do quite like the HSAV arc, apart from the fact that it's taken so long), but I'm prepared for the possibility that the ending is just too much to transcribe.

      I've been counting this arc as having started with Ray and Phillipe's company competition, which moved on to Phillipe going home, then returning, and I had just kinda figured that it was on his was home the Teodor got sidetracked into the whole Van thing, but seeing as how now Phillipe is back home (and they are listed as clearly two separate arcs in the drop down) I guess that settles it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So basically this arc has been running since the second strip posted in May. That's 4 months and 21 strips of this arc. I'm beginning to suspect that the conclusion, whatever it may be, will not be as entertaining as the build up thus far. I have enjoyed this arc the most since the GOF, and it would truly be a shame to see it just fade away, to just slink from the room like so many pimpled middle schoolers at a middle school dance. But a Chris Onstad's gotta do what a Chris Onstad's gotta do. I can't complain about any delays in developments, because he's basically given us all 10 years of golden nuggets for the low low price of a fanflow subscription (or in some cases of no price at all).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even though standing there with your digital hand out might smack of a tad bit crass, having not produced much lately, maybe it's those dire financial straights that have led to this lack of recent output. IN FACT, I'd like to postulate right now that Achewood is so far in the red right now that Chris has had to take a job as night manager (or possibly assistant to the executive sous chef) at his local Denny's Diner, which is what inspired this arc in the first place. While taking out the trash one night, Onstad chanced to find two homeless men performing oral sex on one another in  the darkened alley behind the restaurant, and the only way he could process what he had seen was to write about it in cartoon form, substituting anthropomorphic animals for the humans in this case, because that makes the whole thing much easier to deal with.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's clearly a case of art imitating life.

      It may indeed have been Herodotus who said, "Eat a bag of dicks".   <br/>

However, it was Aristotle who said, "Finish the goddamn story arc!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I... I'm sorry.  That was mean-spirited of me.  Actually this is a good intermission before the final act of the Nice Pete story arc.  Perfect placement, in fact.  The elements are all in play, Ray has been roused from drunken slumber, and we're set to undergo a change in tone wherein Ray's humorous antics lighten up the arc prior to resolution.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or maybe something entirely different will happen.  After all, this  <em>is</em>  Achewood.

people here seem obsessed with "endings" and "emotional closure" but the way I see it, life goes on. At some point in the future Polly will be referenced again, but the story of how they met was a beginning and so didn't need an ending as such. <br/>

      As I recall, it just sort of stopped rather than actually ending. Kind of like what happens when you're reading a book you're not entirely enthusiastic about. You finish chapter 9, put a bookmark in it, and set it down. Then you just never get around to finishing it.

      Well, Polly's still in the story. No important events involving her were left hanging.  <br/>

I'm happy enough with endings that don't wrap anything up (I thought  <em>The Sopranos</em>  ending was perfect), but in this case there are seriously ragged, possibly burning threads still hanging.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Really, this arc requires a denouement, but I won't be too surprised if we don't get one.  <br/>

      Follow your Muse, Onstad, but remember that not every installment of Achewood has got to be a Thing. You did just fine with three to four panels back in the day.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
At least you finally took down the small image for linking purposes that claimed Achewood updated twice a week. But hey, maybe those days could become a reality -- if you didn't feel like you had to top your past arcs. You don't, after all. Even the Beatles had "Wild Honey Pie" on the same album as "Back in the U.S.S.R." And both are worthwhile in their own way. <br/>

      Back in the USSR is probably in the bottom 50% of the Beatles' output, quality-wise, but it's still a solid, fun song. People seem to have this need to pronounce music by well-known talented musicians to be shit. Maybe it's an ego thing. <br/> 
Basically, Katy Perry is shit, Back in the USSR is average to good.

      Well, sure, if we're going to compare it to all the music ever made, "Back in the USSR" is decent. When I say it's terrible I am speaking within the context of the rest of the Beatles' music. It does not even begin to approach the quality of, say, "Hey Jude", "For No One", "Within You Without You", etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Those aren't necessarily examples of the best of the best of the Beatles, but for some reason I can't think of many of their songs off the top of my head right now.)

      I feel dizzy. The room is spinning. I think I'm going to be sick. <br/> 
Tekende thinks that Back in the USSR is a bad song, and Hey Jude is good. <br/> 
Seriously, I know all artistic value judgements are ultimately subjective but you have horrible taste in Beatles songs. Just awful. Okay, I'm done being self righteous. <br/> 
No I'm not. I know you are entitled to your opinions but I honestly believe that Back In the USSR is one of the greatest moments in pop history. McCartney effortlessly deconstructed ten years of American rock and roll. In one perfect instant he ended a musical era. After Back in the USSR nothing could ever be the same again. It's both a pitch perfect parody and a love letter. <br/> 
Hey Jude, on the other hand, is just one dreary little refrain repeated ad nauseam and I would be quite happy never to hear it again. <br/> 
Sorry to be such a pompous arsehole about this, but I absolutely love that song.

      On the most basic level  <em>Back in the USSR</em>  fuses the fast, electric blues based rock and roll of Chuck Berry and the Doo Wop backing vocals of Beach Music, and the Beach Boys in particular. However while the music pays honest homage to these performers the lyrics and title mock the sunny optimism of those performers. The song is guying the bright, parochial patriotism of  <em>Back in the USA</em>  and  <em>California Girls</em> . The Beach Boys sung the praises of girls from 'all round the world' - east coast, northern, southern, midwestern and Californian, but the Beatles reminds them that they know nothing at all about Moscow girls. Hoagy Carmichael is not the only one with Georgia on his mind.  <br/> 
This is all particularly significant given the date at which the song comes out. The White Album was released shortly after  <em>White Light/White Heat</em>  and  <em>Their Satanic Majesties Request</em> . McCartney admitted that he wrote Helter Skelter in an attempt to top The Who after  <em>I Can See for Miles and Miles</em>  was called 'the heaviest' song ever recorded. Rock and Pop were changing forever and it takes a particular genius to look backward at the moment in time and weigh up American rock and roll, to thank them for the music, have a laugh at the corny sensibilities and naive optimism, before the rest of the album leads us into the future.

      But hey: it doesn't matter that it's "one dreary little refrain repeated ad nauseum."  The wonderful coming-together (pun intended) of all those claps, vocals (especially Paul's), piano and guitar, that's what it is man.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not because of how much I like the song, it's because of what the song is.  You can't think of the in-fighting and the strife (which actually helped create the song) and the political climate and the shootings and the stabbings and the Yokos and the Lindas when you listen to "Hey Jude."  I don't like people who don't like "Hey Jude."  It doesn't take much to be on my good side, but if you're one of those people who are against "Hey Jude," I don't like you.  Sorry.  One turn of pompous assholery deserves another, I firmly believe that.

      This is tremendously stupid. Back in the USSR has its place, and it's clever and catchy, but Hey Jude was all that and more. Hey Jude laid down some of the most important pop structures for the years to come. Hey Jude is responsible for, I would say, about 50% of good pop music. You can hear it in everything from Sufjan Stevens to Daft Punk.

      I don't believe killing all the five year olds in the world would substantially slow down population growth.  Plus how awful!  Children are beautiful and say the darndest things.  A baby's smile makes rainbows sing in heaven &c. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Today, I read the definition of "childhood schizophrenia."  The signs of it are when a child suffers "delusions and hallucinations, exhibits irrational behavior, and has trouble with daily tasks such as taking baths."  I immediately doubled over with laughter.

      Babies and five year olds are different.  But yes, though I can't really stand young kids, I know I was one and they're kind of necessary to the world and yes, sometimes one will say a darnded thing and make your day.  But sometimes they suck.

      Well, I suppose people presumed you were asking due to ignorance of past Roomba content.  I don't really think Roomba would pay to have their content advertised on a webcomic such as this one, because it would really not reach such a HUGE audience and thus would be an inefficient advertising strategy.

      I originally dismissed the idea of Onstadt being paid by Roomba (or iRobot, the iMakers of iCleaning devices and iTazerTanks), but then I remembered something from History.  Back when Chris hosted the brief AIM chatroom for all dozen Achewood fans, he mentioned at one time getting mailed a case of Ketel One, and did not know if it had been a promotion or a crazed fan. I do not know if he was being Serious.

      These are clearly Teodore's flashbacks. The roomba noise is the sound of the van and then it is his protestation. There is a "bag" of "dicks" being "eaten". The desire for a limo... anything but the van. This strip is better, by far, than "Citizen Kane".

      damn. son, you've stuck your foot in it this time but there's no other path but the one you've taken. You asked for a bit of gossip and the mother of all gossip whores is gonna tell you all about it. You just discovered daddy's cigarettes and now your going to smoke the whole pack, one after the other. never again will you go onto the internet or into the public square without looking over your shoulder. Nothing you do in public is private and none of it will be forgotten. Did I mention that everywhere is public? Every picture ever taken of you, every transaction, every post to every website, your shopping preferences, your taste in music, movies, politics as well as drink and sexual interests are instantly updated to u-tube, on-star and the three major credit bureaus. You heard 'brown sugar' shopping at the safeway and the picked up a box of cajun rice mix. The cameras and credit card confirm this. Your file at marketing has been updated. The next time you walk by the delta cafe you'll be tweeted an invite for a po' boy sandwich and a mint julip....You might wonder... how did they know?... <br/> 
They know, they won't forget, and eventually you will thank them.

I love what you've done. I think Ramses would make a mean Walter though, so I would probably have Lyle play the dick. Nightlife would make great Stranger and I would like to see Showbiz in it too, maybe as Knox Harrington, the Video Artist. Also Jackie Treehorn, since Ray is taken, could be well portrayed by Benjamin Butters. <br/>

      Back before the days of Assetbar, Achewood occasionally had links embedded in the comic as part of the joke/experience.  You'd click on the strip, and it would take you to some related page that Onstad had found.  These all got wiped out because clicking on the strip at achewood.com now takes you to Assetbar, of course.  But in the last year or so, some of the old links have been restored in the strips here (but not at achewood.com).

When a waiter at a restaurant doesn't come back to my table for seven times longer than they should, they do not get a tip.  Why, if there were a management of this establishment of positive repute, I would call them to the table and dump the remainder of my Penne Arrabiata all over their shoes.  <br/>

      When I was a young and stupid person I was out with some friends and we had the absolute worst waitress ever. Being a young stupid person I decided to leave a tip of one penny, but instead of just leaving it I made an awful mess on the table with condiments and etc and put the penny in the middle of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Looking back that was probably the wrong thing to do and I am probably a terrible person to this day but oh well. Today I tip a 15% minimum regardless of service and 20-30% if the service is exceptional.

      That reminds me of this one time I was at some restaurant it wasn't a Denny's or anything like that it was just some local establishment with some boilerplate name.  So anyway, the food was okay and the waitress was great but I had all this pent-up sexual lust for her so I didn't leave a tip and I drove to my bank and withdrew $50 in pennies which as it turned out was more pennies than I bargained for because I had quite a few left over when all was said and done but so anyway I drove back to the restaurant and I waited in my car in a parking lot across the street.  Finally after closing I saw her leaving and she got in her car.  I followed her for several blocks to get an idea of her route until I found a good stretch of narrow road along the way.  So the next day I went back to the restaurant about a half hour before closing time but her car wasn't there.  So I went back the next day and it was there.  She must have had a day off.  So about a half hour before closing time I broke out all the windows of her car with my tire iron from the trunk.  It was quick and didn't make much noise and no one noticed.  So I waited in my car across the street again.  Finally she came out and when she saw her car she went back in.  I was worried she might call the police on the spot and wait for them to show up and file a police report on the spot, because that would just delay things, but fortunately she didn't.  She and some co-workers brushed the glass off the seats as best they could and she got in and drove away, visibly in a state of anger and upset.  So I'm following her, and she is taking the same route as the previous day.  So I pass her, and I get far enough ahead to where she can't see me anymore, and then when I get to the narrow stretch of road, I stop, right in the middle of the road, and I put my hood up and I get out, with my huge burlap sack of pennies from the bank.  She arrives within about 30 seconds, and as I expected, she's kind of confused to see a car stopped in the middle of the road.  The fact that the hood is up signals to her that I'm in distress, and I poke my head up from under the hood and wave to her from the front of the car.  She isn't sure what to do, and it's at this point that I leap towards her car, my erect penis in my left hand, masturbating furiously, and I plop the open bag of pennies down on her hood.  I reach in with my right hand (still masturbating with my left hand) and I grab fistfulls of pennies, and I throw them at her with as much vigor as I can muster.  As you can imagine, what I have set up is a sort of primitive video game similar to the games they used to make for the Atari 2600 which I had bought from a rummage sale when I was a child.  This game I have now setup is as elegant as Tetris in it's simplicity of design, yet this simplicity of design belies a complex and solid strategic component inherent in the game.  She starts screaming, obviously somewhat terrified.  The pain and disorientation caused by tens of pennies hitting her in the face hindered her ability to put the car back in gear and to drive away.  All four of her car door windows were broken out, so even if she did manage to get the car going, I would still have an honorable shot at her from almost any direction.  So I have the bag of pennies on the front driver's side of her hood, and I'm retrieving fist fulls of pennies and whipping them at her as fast as I can with my throwing arm, while continuing to masturbate my penis with my left hand.  Within about 30 seconds of this the initial shock wore off, and a determination seemed to set in.  She took both her arms down from shielding her face, and still screaming, managed to shove the car into gear despite the now even more brutal barrage hitting her in the face and eyes.  She was wearing glasses, but a well aimed shot of pennies took them off in one fell swoop, and from there on her eyes did take some severe hits.  So unfortunately, the gear she got her car into was drive, and she rear-ended my parked car.  I had to grab the bag of pennies with both hands off her hood as she executed this driving-like-a-typical-bitch maneuver, and this enraged me because I had to stop my masturbating to hold onto the bag of pennies with one hand and continue throwing at her with another.  It was instantly evident that I hadn't really planned this out as well as I could or should have.  Obviously, I needed to have tied the bag of pennies around my neck, but there was no time for that now.  I continued to toss pennies as she fumbled with the controls of the car.  Some of my volleys were damn near point blank.  But it made no difference -- She was determined, and her now almost hoarse and cracking finger-nails-on-chalkboard scream was still going strong.  She got it in reverse, and steam gushing from under her hood, she whipped the car around in what must have been an accidental but still surprisingly professional looking maneuver whereby the front end's momentum pulls it around the back end in an almost perfect 180 degree turn.  I was left with no target save the back window of her car as she drove off, probably back towards the restaurant as in her state of shock and awe her mind would probably take her back there automatically. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Looking back that was probably the wrong thing to do and I am probably a terrible person to this day but oh well. Today I tip a 15% minimum regardless of service and 20-30% if the service is exceptional, and now I have one of those portable DVD players affixed to my dashboard with double-sided velcro tape to help relieve my sexual tension and frustration whenever I feel the urge to head to the bank for some pennies. <br/>

      Unless this is some ripoff of a Nice Pete blog post, this should have a LOT more chubbies than the 3 it currently has. <br/> 
That story was with me all day. Even on the golf course my own shiny coin on the carpet gave me the shudders.

      this is so wrong.  wrong on several levels. <br/> 
 <br/> 
First, I'd be getting a chubby from a guy who hoards chubbies.  That's like getting a hug from someone with an anti-social disorder who rarely hugs anyone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Second, paying someone to hug or chubby you is cheating.  That's like paying a prostitute after she has sex with you.  The sex doesn't mean as much and isn't as enjoyable if you know you're going to have to pay for it! <br/> 
 <br/> 
So no thanks, I don't want your $75 chubby job.  Not unless there's some way I can then later charge-back the $75 donation on my credit card.  Hmm.. failure to deliver more than one strip a month... yeah, I guess I might be able to sell that one to the credit card department that does charge backs.

      In my professional opinion, Mr. Onstad is deep in conversation with his shadow archetypes and has taken the courageous step of representing those conversation in the form of a public comic strip.  I suspect that, in the past, his shadow projections were limited only to his collection of stuffed animals, and never left the privacy of his own home.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I applaud his generosity in choosing to share his inner psychic journey with us in this way, and I don't begrudge him the time it takes to wrestle those characters out of his unconscious and onto the screen.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
As C. G. Jung once said, we each have a "personal cosmology" that needs to be expressed, usually in written form.  This represents the journey we each undertake toward integrating the disparate components of our psyche into an individuated whole.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
To put it another way, cut Chris some slack -- what he's doing ain't easy!

      I think it all depends on the animation.  I hate animated avatars that contribute too much visual noise - flashing, scene changes, and so on - but I think a simple avatar that stays simple, but  <em>moves</em>  can be nice - distinctive and dynamic but not overwhelming.  This is the philosophy behind my animated avatar.

      I don't want to be That Guy who's all "I was gonna donate but...," but I guess I have to be. It's not worth donating right now. I mean, I love me some Onstadian material. Every month I browse the archives and find new delights hidden among old friends (shit, that reads like a bad review of a $13 Asian buffet). <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I am concerned that The End of Achewood is near. Not in terms of plot...personally, I'm not one for the fan speculation on which paths Achewood will take. What I mean is that it's been two weeks since the last update, and the last update is an installment of that silly Roomba thing that I've never really gotten the feeling is a big draw to the current fanbase or new readers. And before that, strips with a week to two between each one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And this comes as Onstad pleads us for funds, yet this year has seen spotty updates and a continued attempt to outdo past storylines, with hardly a breath taken in between. Onstad's clearly burned out on a lot of his ideas (remember the blogs? I wince whenever I see fans or reviewers still claiming that Onstad maintains a dozen blogs). Hell, I pay for the Premium Updates and nothing has really shown up of late. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So is it worth donating a hundo or such when I might come back to this page in a week or two and find that it is going to exist just as an archive while Onstad pursues New Yorker freelancing or a TV deal or another comic? <br/> 
 <br/> 
More power to Onstad if he wants to write more, or develop material for other media, or develop a new comic. But if the Muse no longer sings to him of Achewood, I don't want to spend my money sending him off on a new venture. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, it is free. That's why someone's restaurant metaphor fell flat a number of posts above (in all fairness, I thought their analogy has its strong points).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But in the webcomic market, you have to give people a reason to return. The comic is, as Onstad I believe once described it, a "loss leader." However, it is what drives people to buy the shirts and other merch, drives them to click the links to his related projects, etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Without that free material coming on a regular basis, he must know that his audience will lose interest or visit so intermittently that they won't contribute to keeping the site afloat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So Onstad: again, follow your Muse. If it means taking a break from Achewood, make it official. Give us a countdown clock. Go ahead and draw a couple return strips now so you have something to toss up when the clock ticks down. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then, go have a beer, take a deep breath, and look for other projects. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or, just start updating regularly! Watch the traffic swell and the merch sell! And if doesn't, take that break. You deserve it.

      I just got curious about how much people have actually donated. The high-low difference is pretty large though since the last category is $101-$500 . <br/> 
 <br/> 
In any event, the least he's received is $11,867. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, the most Onstad has received is $46,878. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, Onstad either 1) should have enough to keep the servers firing and is just sick as a dog and/or being Mr. Mom as his twitter says or 2) got way more than he was expecting and is now in Thailand getting "massages" and living like a king.

      Yeah I'm feeling strangely guilty about my pissy $30 contribution.  $30  <em>Australian</em> , no less.  It's like paying for a worn, early-model luxury sedan with a herd of feral goats. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I was 12, I had a friend who lived on a goat farm in the hills with his Baptist parents and I would go to stay some weekends.  He had a little sister, who was a standard annoying little sister, but also a foster-sister who was three years older than us, could only say three or four words and had two parallel rivers of thick yellow snot coursing down her top lip and into her mouth at all times, spraying across the room and onto your face whenever she felt moved to express her feelings in four words or less.  Such was the melting compassion of my friend's Baptist preacher father, who always spoke gently, carried a big stick and completely creeped me out.  When I read David Copperfield recently, Mr Murdstone took the exact form of this guy for me.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
One night my friend and I were talking in the dark before going to sleep, and he was blathering all this great Baptist bumwash about the Pope going to hell because he's not a Baptist, then segued neatly into "you're going to hell too."  This was news to me, and on asking why he had odds on my burning in eternal torment on the conclusion of my baffling yet nondescript existence, he explained "because you don't believe in God."  To my knowledge I hadn't expressed any particular opinion on God's existence, but following a few moments of deep reflection decided that my long-standing predeliction for spiritual thoughts and feelings meant that I acknowledged  <em>something</em>  greater than myself, albeit no particular presumption this something was some bearded, wrathful old fart on a cloud.  If that ill-defined  <em>something</em>  could be regarded as "God", then sure: "But I do believe in God."  "Really?!" came the answer in the dark, brimming with incredulous joy, followed by an alarming scurry from the bedclothes, a bolt of light from the hallway as the bedroom doorway opened and before I could say a word my friend was off down to his parents' room to proclaim the Good News, to my infinite horror. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was about 1am on a Sunday night, and his father came sauntering in to the bedroom, where I cowered under the covers, feeling more 6 than 12.  He sat on my bed and put a caring hand on the bulge of my hip.  "Lizard [not his real name]..." my name, spoken low and with persuasion, hung in the air for an eternity as the heavy silhouette framed by the open door regarded me inscrutably, the thick waft of batshit religious adult male mingling with the faint tang of goat, before "...do you know what this means?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh FUCK.  He thinks his son has converted me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He sat on my bed for about two hours, attempting to load me up with Judeo-Christian mythological bumwash, and trying to establish how I was going to get away from my parents every Sunday to attend their church services.  By the time he'd finished praying over me and returned to his own room - around 4am - I'd made firm commitments to seek strength from the Lord in bringing my family to the Light and to pray for the salvation of their immortal souls from damnation and hell fire. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The next morning, following a breakfast of about three litres of porridge soaked in goat's milk, we trundled off to school on the bus that wound it's way through the forested hills at the arse end of Nowhere, Victoria, Australia.  First up at school was a period of Physical Education.  My friend was a consummate athlete, and revealed to me his prowess was drawn from the power of prayer.  Still immersed in my 3am deprogramming experience, I stood utterly stunned by this revelation.  Could it be that my 12 entire years of hapless, humiliating physical incapacity was entirely due to my apparent heathenism?  I dared to hope as I watched my friend effortlessly perform a vault over a "horse" in the gymnasium, then gathered my courage, prayed an awkward prayer to God for the ability to perform the same feat, then launched myself at the horse. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Chapter 56 - The Leap of Faith.</strong> <br/> 
I've never been very good at being upside down.  Even when doing turns in the swimming pool that keeps me basically fit, I compulsively twist my head around to make sure it's the right way up and end up with a sprained neck.  In the case of this particular vault, I leapt at the horse, placed my hands where they needed to be, and attempted to raise my legs up and over my head to complete the flip.  Unable as I was to accept that my head should be facing the opposite direction to that in which my body was headed, I ended up simply propelling myself, Superman-like, over the horse and across around 3 metres of the gymnasium, flipping over late in the piece to impact heavily on the small of my back, just beyond the gym mat.  God was punched out of my lungs along with everything else.  Laughter ensued as I choked and gasped for air. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then I became an architect!

      How kind.  I'm rather hoping he wanders off into the thick scrub at the rear of his property clothed in naught but the remnants of a hastily uprooted daisy bush with a bottle of the good stuff in one fist and spends a good month going utterly batshit in the woods.  Did me the world of good.  Then he can come back and become a dental hygienist or something. <br/>

      I used to have a neighbor, we'll call him Burt.  Burt was in third grade when I was in first grade, so he was a bit older, and sorta weird.  He always seemed just a little slow, and his parents would yell at him a lot. <br/> 
He had 3 cats. He liked to do stuff to/with his cats. Most of it wasn't bad. He'd make an elaborate slide out of cardboard boxes for them, or put their water dish on a roller skate so that it would slide all over while they tried to drink from it. <br/> 
But sometimes it would be darker. He'd put all his pillows on the ground and drop the cat from the top bunk. He was not allowed to go on the roof after something happened involving the cats. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One time, while building a fort behind Burt's shed, we were climbing over a big composting heap of lawn clippings. In this heap, we spied a skull! An animal skull! Digging a bit more, with sticks to avoid germs, we unearthed the skeleton of a cat. I can remember the way the ribs were so perfectly preserved, forming a neat little cage. I asked Burt if he was missing a cat, and he said no. I didn't believe him and ran home. The next day, I found out that Burt was grounded for a week. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Allow me to digress for a bit.  In 1st grade, we would have 30 minutes every day to read a book of our choice. During this time we could go to the bathroom, one boy and one girl at a time. Each returning boy/girl would return and inform the next desk that they were okay to go to the bathroom.  Every so often, it would spread from one boy to another that someone had pooped on the floor.  Sure enough, you'd get to the bathroom, peek under the stall, and see a tiny pile of poop.  I once asked my dad why someone would poop on the floor, right next to the toilet. He said sometimes people who needed help because of problems acted out in strange ways.  This didn't make much sense to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Returning to the original story: A week or so later, as a special treat, my teacher gave us all model kits. These kits would make jungle animals and dinosaurs. They were basically sheets of balsa wood, stamped so you could pop out pieces that would notch together to make an approximation of a fossil.  You are likely familiar with these.  As I started to make my T-Rex I punched out the head first, because it was the coolest. Then the spine/tail, because it was the biggest. Then I popped out the ribs, and began to notch them into the spine. I started to feel ill.  By the time I had all of them in there, I couldn't stand to look at that neat little balsa ribcage.  I finished the model poorly, not gluing anything in. I couldn't stand the sight of it, and gave it to the boy next to me.  Later that day, during reading time, I kept peeking at it on the boys desk. I hated that thing. When it was my turn to go to the bathroom I went directly to the stall. I had never pooped not on a toilet, and was worried about the logistics. I took my pants entirely off.  When my task was complete, it was very difficult to put my pants back on without stepping in my work, but I succeeded.

He needs to communicate more.  Jon over at Goats did it right when he had his huge freak out.  Told everybody exactly what was up and how, instead of dragging his audience through the mud.

      fuck no.  in an age when everyone sends out a tweet update every time they scratch their dick, classy is to be non-communicative.  It's a new and different experience.  It's such an unusual performance to be non-communicative and it's so rare that it actually might even qualify now as performance art.    <br/>

      Eccleston is the  <strong>Ninth</strong>  Doctor... <br/>

Personally, "Empty Child" is probably my favorite episode from Doctor Who, period.  (Admittedly, though, I haven't seen -all- the old stuff - maybe about half of it...)  I think "Blink" is more popular but I think "Empty Child" is better.
