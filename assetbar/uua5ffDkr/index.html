      In fact, I may think up a special occasion for which I will go to Safeway and pick up a turkey, a bottle of Christian Brothers, and No-Doz to celebrate. If the bill comes to more than $31.34, I will be annoyed . . . well, ok, I live in San Francisco, so maybe it'll be a little more.

      In Kansas the only liquor legal for sale in grocery stores or general convenience stores is 3.2% alcohol beer or equivalent. If you want anything other than "three-two beer" you have to go to a liquor store. No alcohol sales on Sundays either or, IIRC, after 1 or 2 AM. I don't drink so I'm not entirely up on this, but if you live in the Kansas City area it's right on the border with Missouri so you'll get people going over the state line occasionally to take advantage of the more lax laws there.

      To me the craziest thing was discovering a few years ago with friends that apparently liquor stores are closed on the Fourth of July. At first I thought it was just a few local stores being closed, but it looks like all the ones in my town at the time were. Isn't drinking sort of how the holiday is celebrated though? It made no sense to me.

      Interestingly, 4th July was seen as huge opportunity for temperance in antebellum America: just in the same way that the original Independence Day was freedom from the tyranny of King George, later celebrations emphasised the freedom from the tyranny of "King Alcohol". Apparently at the movement's height in 1844 President Tyler received influential temperance reformers at the White House. So it's probably a remnant from that. <br/>

      It's the same way in Kentucky, or in most counties around here at least. You can't buy alcohol after 1 AM or on Sundays. We're only about 10 minutes from Indiana though, we can just cross the bridge to get sunday booze.

      Here in Texas, alcohol sales are regulated on a county-by-county basis.  I don't know of any county, though, that allows hard liquor sales outside of liquor stores.  Only beer and wine are available in other locations, and only between certain hours.

      Not entirely true.  Some small town (and we're talking very small) grocery stores have a BC Liquor section.  It's almost run as a separate store though.  You have to pay at a different register and everything, but it's still in the same store.

      Well they ARE expecting the man who comes in to this feast to think that $3.00 is a good price for wine.  I suppose they'd apply the same logic to turkey and brandy.  Also it is more raw to eat like a working class man.
