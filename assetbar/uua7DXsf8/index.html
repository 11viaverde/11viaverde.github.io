      Onstad seems to understand depression from the inside out, true, but I think it would be unfair to single out one character as "him."  We each have many facets to our personalities, and Onstad may be more Ray in his dreams than he is Beef in his behavior.

      Apparently there is an actual person upon whom Roast Beef is based, and it's not Onstad.  I know this entirely secondhand, but I have no reason to disbelieve the person who told it to me.

      I've always felt pretty much the opposite: that Teodor was the most poorly developed of the original main characters. Of course, he suffers from having much less "face time" than Ray or Beef, but although he's about as predictable as Lyle or Cornelius in his own way, he's much more formless. I mean, what's his deal? Cooking? Being a mediocre guitarist? Griping about having no lady action? At least Lyle and Cornelius and Pat have archetypes to prop them up (The Drunk, The Posh Old Guy, The Vegan Asshole); Teodor feels to me like the embodiment of Onstad's leftover interests. If achewood had maintained more of the ensemble approach of the first couple years, the fact that Teodor isn't defined by one thing would be an asset to his character's development. However, as a fairly distant second-tier character he just seems like an amorphous entity used primarily as a "straight man" foil against Philippe or Ray. This isn't to say I dislike Teodor, I just think he's something of a casualty to the Ray / Beef dyad.

      But thats exactly why Teodor rings true as a character. All of these left over interests. Being a jack-of-all, passionate-about-none kind of 20-something. Teodor is that feeling you get when you think, "Shit! I'm (age) years old and I haven't DONE anything with my life."  <br/> 
Take the comic above. I challenge anyone to honestly say that they haven't lusted after their friends squeeze and felt horrible about it even while not acting upon said feelings.  <br/> 
And yet, Teodor's life is actually pretty great. He's single. He's got solid friends. He can kind of cook. He the personification of melodrama that is completely uncalled for. People always say that they relate to Roast Beef. But really, if you think that, you're more likely to be a Teodor.

      Obviously I need to have more male friends because of the few I have who are male, straight, and in a relationship I've never felt that they had a better girlfriend than I do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The closest it's ever come involves having seen a friend's girlfriend's breasts for a lengthy period of time in a sexual context and her seeming like the type who'd be up for some group action making the point rather moot. Still, I wouldn't exactly qualify that as lust. She was just the closest possible candidate for which lust could have been felt and even then I never got the impression that I'd rather be with her than my own girlfriend.

      This is indeed a troubling case. When presented with a potentially erotic situation involving a friend of the gender that you fancy is it more problematic to get an erection implying that you might be interested even if only at a base physiological level that you cannot control or to display no interest? <br/>

Either can be seen as somewhat insulting. I think we, as a society, probably ought to move in favor of the latter. If a dude pops one at you then just take it as a compliment and move along.

      Learn to keep your hips back when hugging, dude.  There's that little lean forward you do with women you are not currently boning, nor do you seek to bone in the foreseeable future, or for which you should not exhibit a bone for various legal, ethical and moral reasons, or because you're embarassed or afraid.  (These terms are not meant to cover all possible situations for displaying an erect penis while hugging, and any and all actions resulting from an involuntary bone are hereby forgiven.)*** <br/>

      It may be that I was raised correctly, but I was told this very thing at a young age.  It was called the 'creepy hug', and if your pelvis was within a foot of the girl when you hug, you were doing the creep.  I assumed this was universal man knowledge, like not talking at the can.  My God, do some men hug each other with their business touching the other guy?

      That reminds me. I was at a bar a while ago and had to go to the bathroom, and one of my friends (who more than slightly resembles Lyle) also had to go pretty bad, so we went in at the same time. There were only two urinals right next to each other, but we'd known each other since 8th grade and it was an emergency so we figured we could bend the 'rule'. Then mid-stream, another guy comes out of the stall and as he's washing his hands I notice that my friend is looking at me with the most drunken mischievous gleam in his eye that I've ever seen. Now, you have to keep in mind that the stranger didn't see us come in together, so from his perspective we were just two random guys who happened to be pissing next to each other. So right as the guy has dried his hands and is starting to walk out, my friend turns to me and very loudly says, "Hey...HEY!" <br/> 
-"What?" <br/> 
-"...nice COCK."

I'm sure nobody wants to hear that story about two fairly attractive girls getting mad rutty with each other in front of everyone (literally in front of as in about a foot or so in front of a group of guys sitting there watching) in the middle of the room at a party one time. I spent the time talking to a very, very boring person about water management issues and how he was installing a more environmentally friendly water heater in the in-law apartment he rented out in his house. A good friend of my girlfriend was there, you see, and I dare not be seen as choosing to look.

      Years ago I was in Wal-Mart with a buddy of mine and he was picking up a bunch of stuff. He happened to place a jar of lotion and a box of condoms side by side. When the lady checking us out picked up the condoms she glanced at the lotion and then at us. At this point I reached over and placed my hand atop his. He wasn't too happy but I got a kick out of it.

      She's not 2D. She's just normal, which just seems weird compared to the other characters and most of the people who read the comic. A couple of my friends have girlfriends like her. Really nice, fairly smart, will probably make a great wife, but there's just nothing particularly quirky or interesting about them.

      Might happen, but it seems like Onstad has been slowly building to this strip for a while, and I appreciate it, actually.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know I'm not the only one who has thought that T had a bit of an unspoken crush on Molly, and Molly a perhaps unrealized crush on Teodor.  It goes back quite a ways, mostly to the blogs, when Molly, at times, seemed excited to run into Teodor in public and at Ray's parties.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just taking a quick glance at some of Molly's 2004 blogs, see how many times she mentions having fun talking to T, AIM-ing T, dancing with him at the parties when Beef was acting moody, etc.  I just recently got one of the books that has an "unpublished" blog entry for Ray about one of his parties, where Beef almost fought Teodor because Molly and T were having too good of a time while Beef was in a bit of stitch and not enternainin Molly. <br/> <br/> <br/> It can certainly change how you might look at  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100420202627/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=02052008">this strip</a> .  A little pent up angst at not just the sex havin', but who it's being had with?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, this sounds like I've had this outlined for a while or something; I haven't.  I just remember noticing the signs in the blogs back in the day, and wondering if Onstad was ever going to do with it, so it's fun to see it wasn't all just random.  Maybe Onstad just wants to play J.K. Rowling and have his own version of that HARRY & HERMIONE vs. RON & HERMIONE fanboy turf war bullshit.  Whatever...could make for an interesting spanner in the works, however it turns out.

      I think you may be on to something, but people are oversimplifying. No, Teodor isn't "in love" with Molly, but rather the idea of Molly. Let me explain- Roast Roast Beef was a wreck, always, and without hyperbole. Teodor, on the other hand, was just a typical guy, if not a bit on the geeky side, not dissimilar to most readers of the comic. Then Roast Beef gets a girl, and starts going on a track of self improvement, to the point of being able to deal with his crushing depression. This does two things for Teodor: First, he's now more pathetic than Beef- his life is going nowhere, where Beefs is going up; Second, he sees a tangible cause for this change- a woman, Beef has one and he doesn't- this causes both jealousy and bitterness, bitterness that an apparent trainwreck like Beef has more to offer the ladies than he. Teodor is lonely and kind of latches onto the only woman he has any regular contact with, Molly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Molly, on the other hand is from another era- she is alone. Honestly, what friends does she have? They are probably all dead. People need to socialize, and Molly needed friends. No stop for a second and think- which of all of Beef's friends might she get along with? Honestly most of them are so rude, she probably does her best just to stay polite. That leaves the only polite ones: Teodor, Phillipe and Cornelious; and of those three, which do you think she'll have things in common with?

      Oh, I agree for the most part.  I specifically used "has a crush on" and not "in love with" because I think Teodor is going through what a lot of dateless wonders go through: romantic/sexual thoughts and behaviors get channeled, willingly or unwillingly, through any women you might interact with: friends' wives/girlfriends, coworkers, etc.  I think T knows in this case that he's not in love with Molly, but there is an attraction, though he realizes it's more of a subconsious reaction that he should be able to control better.

      Plus, she's the only woman of any stature in the achewood universe (her closest competitor would be Tina, who hasn't been heard from in three years), so she's got no touchy-feely conversational outlet. Beef probably can't stand to talk about that stuff much with all of his emotional baggage and self-doubt. Teodor's the most femme of the other characters by far. It makes a lot of sense that things are going in this direction, and it makes a nice parallel to Beef's adulterous temptation. Definitely not going to happen, though.

      Tina really needs to come back, if there is to be any development of Molly's character. They can really help each other develop through conversation. Of course that would probably require Onstad to do intensive investigative research into the minds and lives of womenfolk.

      I see what you are saying, but the way a person acts in life and the development of a character in a fiction are pretty different.  It's not that Molly isn't a believable character - it's that we don't get to see her develop and don't get a peek under the hood at what drives her.  In fact, we don't get to see much of her at all - especially in any of the situations that mold a person day-to-day.

      Back when I was a band we used to play shows with a band called Get to the Chopper. They would always play in front of a giant banner-sized poster of Arnold, and every set consisted of a single 20-minute song of mostly improvised random noise punctuated at odd intervals by each of the members taking turns screaming "GET TO THE CHOPPER" into the microphone. They were much better than us.

      Tangential fact: I thing I have learned is that English stereotypes of how Irish people look are different from American stereotypes of how Irish people look. From what I gather, redheadedness is not considered stereotypically Irish over here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another tangential fact: When I was at the doctor's office yesterday, the forms I filled out asked for my ethnicity. My options in terms of whiteness were "White British," "White Irish," and "Other white." Apparently there is enough of an ethnic distinction between English/Scottish/Welsh people and Irish people that they need two separate boxes, but all other white people are the same ethnicity?

      You are doubtless aware that the British and Irish have had their Troubles over the years.  This silly form is an interesting artifact of how many of them must see that relationship.  It would be rather like a similar form in Minnesota listing "White German" and "White Norwegian." Sort of.

These are based on census categories. Various nationalist groups whine about not being represented. Then Ulstermen and anyone who doesn't care needs "White British." You will note that there is no English category, because the only people who care here own pitbulls and/or read the Daily Mail.

      Pogo, I'm ashamed of you. You went through the American education system - at a time when it hadn't been butchered and strangled by the government to the point where a small dog or fish could graduate - and you don't know that the possessive "its" has no apostrophe? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll let it slide if you claim that your dick was doing the typing. Like lolcats, genitalia don't understand the finer aspects of spelling and grammar.

      Can't blame the old member, I just plain forgot a grammtical peculiarity.  And me a writer, too!   <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're right, not only doesn't "its" get an apostrophe, but "hers," "ours," "theirs" and "yours" don't either.  However, it's a stupid rule and the internal logic of English dictates an insertion of an apostrophe to indicate possession, so I slip up now and then.  Damn pronouns. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At least I did't confuse "your" and "you're."  That would demand a full body slam.

      It was perhaps one of the greatest failures in eugenics history. Sir Cavier Cavier-Wilkins, born in the jungles of  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Bangladesh in 1824, and heir to the fortune amassed by his grandfather, an administrator with the British East India  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Company, was often called eccentric by his fellow Sahibs. He was something of a practical joker. He invented the technique  <br/> 
 <br/> 
of putting a bucket of water on top of a door to pour upon the next unsuspecting stiff to walk through. Of course, like a  <br/> 
 <br/> 
fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm, this was a sanitized version of a similar tale. The 'stiff' in this case was the viceroy  <br/> 
 <br/> 
who'd stiffed Cavier-Wilkins by having relations with our hero's wife. The bucket was full of menstrual blood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But besides his savage taste for revenge, Cavier-Wilkins could always be found in his courtyard with his nose in the latest  <br/> 
 <br/> 
edition of one of Britain's esteemed scholarly science journals, and he had latched onto a concept known as "genetic  <br/> 
 <br/> 
splicing." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, Sir Cavier Cavier-Wilkins was more a drawing room pontiff than a natural philosopher. The closest he had come to using  <br/> 
 <br/> 
the scientific method was to pour goat's milk into his morning corn flakes. But he had to find some way to use all the money  <br/> 
 <br/> 
his grandfather left him, and the economy in India was far too fledgling for him to conveniently blow it all in one place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But still, once he latched onto a concept, he couldn't be shaken off it, until a new one struck his fancy, much like a  <br/> 
 <br/> 
certain fairer sex that we all know. All he needed was a practical application, and it came to him, like all great concepts,  <br/> 
 <br/> 
through religion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Whilst sitting in church one Sunday morning, Cavier-Wilkins noticed that he was sitting behind Lord Balmington  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Colonialshire, one of his old schoolmates, and recently appointed Punjabi magistrate. Colonialshire always had good marks,  <br/> 
 <br/> 
which boiled the bile of jealousy in Cavier-Wilkins's gullet. Not only that, he had always walked about the schoolyard with  <br/> 
 <br/> 
an air of pretension, most likely because he was actually born in Europe (though it was only fucking Scotland!) and was the  <br/> 
 <br/> 
only one in his class who had yet to lose his virginity to one of the natives (he eventually married one of the richest,  <br/> 
 <br/> 
chastest, largest-bosomed, blondest women in the city). Getting the man to laugh was like trying to milk a boy who speaks  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Urdu -- not enough reward for the effort put in. It seemed as if the man was so purely white that making him laugh was  <br/> 
 <br/> 
counter to his genetic makeup. But if the man could be injected with the genes of a laughing hyena from Deepest Darkest  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Africa, then he would be subject to such great embarrassment that he could never again show his face in any church in all of  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Christendom! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cavier-Wilkins immediately saw the potential benefits, but as with all things  <em>Science!</em>  the negative consequences were  <br/> 
 <br/> 
only visible through the Hubble Space Telescope, which would not be built for nearly a century. While initial eyewitness  <br/> 
 <br/> 
reports of the massacre attributed the bloodletting to a Negroid/Mongoloid Superhybrid, it was later discovered that it was  <br/> 
 <br/> 
an enraged Colonialshire, all hopped up on the savannah juice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The rest, as they say, is history.

Well I've kicked around a lot since high school  <br/> 
I've worked a lot of nowhere gigs  <br/> 
From keyboard man in a rock'n ska band  <br/> 
To haulin' boss crude in the big rigs  <br/> 
Now I've come back home to plan my next move  <br/> 
From the comfort of my Aunt Faye's couch  <br/> 
When I see my little cousin Janine walk in  <br/> 
All I could say was ow-ow-ouch  <br/> 
 <br/> 
CHORUS:  <br/> 
Honey how you've grown  <br/> 
Like a rose  <br/> 
Well we used to play  <br/> 
When we were three  <br/> 
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree? <br/> 
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree? <br/> 
 <br/> 
She turned my life into a living hell  <br/> 
In those little tops and tight capris  <br/> 
I pretended to be readin' the National Probe  <br/> 
As I was watchin' her wax her skis  <br/> 
On Saturday night she walked in with her date  <br/> 
And backs him up against the wall  <br/> 
I tumbled off the couch and heard myself sing  <br/> 
In a voice I never knew I had before  <br/> <br/> <br/> CHORUS:  <br/> 
Honey how you've grown  <br/> 
Like a rose  <br/> 
Well we used to play  <br/> 
When we were three  <br/> 
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree? <br/> 
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree?  <br/> <br/> <br/> I'll teach you everything I know  <br/> 
If you teach me how to do that dance  <br/> 
Life is short and quid pro quo  <br/> 
And what's so strange about a down-home family romance?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
One night we're playin' gin by a cracklin' fire  <br/> 
And I decided to make my play  <br/> 
I said babe with my boyish charm and good looks  <br/> 
How can you stand it for one more day  <br/> 
She said maybe its the skeevy look in your eyes  <br/> 
Or that your mind has turned to applesauce  <br/> 
The dreary architecture of your soul  <br/> 
I said - but what is it exactly turns you off?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
CHORUS  <br/>

      Indeed I do professorhazard. And I remember how we two, our bodies bulging with desire and poultry, repaired to our boudoir where we found our family friend Niko, reclining on our bed, wearing only his jungle of chest hair, natural skin oils, and a bed of rose petals. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We writhed upon and into each other, our mouths and other orifices gaping to release our love cries and accept each others' regurgitated chicken meat, like baby birds in a nest of pubic hair. The three of us made love that would have made the gods jealous. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is, until your killjoy of a wife got home. What had been lovemaking before quickly turned into three dudes just bonin the shit out of her  <em>BANG BANG</em>  then see what I can get out of her.

      You were my high school sweetheart and my girl next door <br/> 
You've been my lifelong best friend and so much more <br/> 
We matured into each other's arms, we were never apart <br/> 
You blossomed into the woman who owned my heart <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're my woman, my lover, my friend <br/> 
 <br/> 
I pushed you on swings, we played in the sand <br/> 
I bought you ice cream from the ice cream man <br/> 
I looked at you like a gardener looks at a flower <br/> 
I would stare out my window at you for hours <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're my woman, my lover, my friend <br/> 
You're my woman, my lover, my friend <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are my tender loving juice fruit, my reason to live <br/> 
My heart's like a butterfly with flowers to give <br/> 
I remember looking back to our high school prom <br/> 
When I shook your dad's hand and gave flowers to your mom <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're my woman, my lover, my friend <br/> 
 <br/> 
I showered you with love, flowers and pearls <br/> 
And you've given birth to our baby girls <br/> 
You're my succulent sweet buttercup, and more importantly my friend <br/> 
We're inseparable love cuddlebunnies til the very end <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're my woman, my lover, my friend <br/> 
You're my woman, my lover, my friend <br/>

      i feel like achewood has gotten more "serious" lately. i can't remember any previous plotlines that dealt so directly with common human foibles and dilemmas. roast beef almost cheated on molly, and now teodor's feelings for molly are finally being acknowledged. i don't take any sort of issue with this development, it's just curious.

      Unlike the greeting-card arc, which felt like Beef got mixed up in a Ray plotline, I'm down with this. I loved the strip when Molls got pissed at Beef for sneaking cleavage peeks... the airline thing, not so much.  Always nice to get a bit of Molly development. And perhaps there will be  <em>shames</em> ?!

      Damnit, T, you're the only friend Molly has who isn't Beef or a co-worker. Just be a good friend, and meet some gothy girl who'll give you a new haircut and let you stay at her place. You can both be kind of flaky together and do inappropriate Public Displays of Smooches.

      Regarding retsina: only a vulgar plebian with no knowledge of biochemistry would say that it tastes like any form of urine. Urea (the active ingredient in urine), urushiol (active ingredient in poison ivy) and urethane (packing material) are all nitrogen-rich compounds. Retsina is made from -- in part -- pine needles, so it tastes of turpentine, which is based on compounds called terpenes. Terpenes are phosphorus compounds. Retsina tastes (and smells) like turpentine, not urine. In college I once got so drunk I fell in the toilet while talking a leak, so I have a vague recollection what urine tastes like. It does not taste like retsina. Retsina tastes like you were going to strip some old varnish and instead drank the remover compound. Every year I go to the Greek Food Festival and drink one retsina, one ouzo and one Metaxa to celebrate the many contributions of the Greek Food Festival to my life. (I was raised in Maryland . . . if that doesn't explain things, read something about Baltimore.) I don't like retsina, I hate licorice with a passion (ouzo is alcoholic licorice) and Metaxa is only good in cinnamon coffee. However, I believe that wherever you are, you need to be a part of things, so in Louisiana I suck the mudbug heads, in  Georgia I eat souse, I get a haggis at the Highland Games and at the Irish Music Festival I get pissed drunk and lie face down in mud. And at the Greek Food Festival, I drink retsina, which tastes like disinfectant, NOT human or animal wastes.

I don't like retsina, I hate licorice with a passion (ouzo is alcoholic licorice) and Metaxa is only good in cinnamon coffee. However, I believe that wherever you are, you need to be a part of things, so in Louisiana I suck the mudbug heads, in  Georgia I eat souse, I get a haggis at the Highland Games and at the Irish Music Festival I get pissed drunk and lie face down in mud. And at the Greek Food Festival, I drink retsina, which tastes like disinfectant, NOT human or animal wastes.

      Hallo, everybody; <br/> 
 <br/> 
Over the past couple of days, many times I would try to access Acheworld, only to be greeted by a  <strong>500 - Internal Server Error</strong>  that would persist for hours and make it impossible to get my daily dose of Achewood social interaction. Other times - despite what browser I use - I try to post a message and the entirety of the system just locks up on me, leading to termination of the program. Why, I've tried to post this message three times now, and yet I keep trying for some reason. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know how common a problem this is for other people, but I just thought I'd take the time (down here, at the unobtrusive bottom of the page) to invite anyone else who gets locked out of the Internet to spend time at my forum until the storm blows over. You can find it under the "Forum" heading, over at Snipe Hunt Media. All are welcome. Except lawbot, who is a dick. Enjoy!

      Yea, I've had the same thing happen, and the result was that all of Assetbar was deprived of my invaluable wit for upwards of two hours. I didn't really think this was a problem for anyone but me, since I figured that a "normal" person would just go "oh I guess Assetbar is down" and go about their regular business of boning and making money and such instead of sitting there and refreshing Facebook, Salon, and Assetbar repeatedly. I think the system just wasn't build to handle the insanity that has occurred since handface weekend. I was hoping that the recent "update" that I got a message about when trying to refresh would fix things but apparently not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thanks for the alternate option, though I feel weird about another forum. Also, is that IRC chat still a Thing?
