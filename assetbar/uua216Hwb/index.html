      I worked in retail for a time, and had a fling with one of my superiors that involved frequent trips to the change rooms. Sadly it was only make-outs (at least during business hours) as there was no time for shenanigans, but there were a number of times when you just  <em>knew</em>  that people were getting rutty in the change rooms and couldn't do anything about it. <br/>

One time a guy did a poop on the floor in a dressing room. The doodie fell out of him, onto the ground.

      Seeing Showbiz finally drop all manner of façade in a moment of clarity in the final panel should be gratifying, given his ultra-douche-iness, but instead it's just...grim. <br/>

But then I recall his shower cam shenanigans from a few years later and feel reassured in my dickish internet judgment of a mustachioed cat.

      This is in my top 5 Achewood comic strips for one reason. <br/> 
It says so much about Onstad's writing that the last panel sums up Showbiz's entire personality.  He is the sort of man who buys car stereo system parts, and is so so much debt from them he cannot afford to purchase a car.  Brilliant.
