      I really like both too. My theory is that there's a certain type of person who thinks they're too good to watch a comedy about high school, but they're actually too Jethro to see the difference between American Pie and Napoleon Dynamite. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The people who lamed you probably hate Cartilage Head and anything to do with Mexican magical realism as well.

      dammit people stop laming this comment I made a year ago. You have had had a year to improve yourselves and start liking Napoleon Dynamite, and if you still do not like it it is because you are a slacker and a filthy mongrel. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will also use this opportunity to say that Napoleon Dynamite does not fall into the same category as the Office (British) or Curb Your Enthusiasm, both of which are prime examples of awkward humor. Napoleon Dynamite is about teenagers, who are always awkward especially in small towns and prom-type situations. It is endearing because it is natural and relatable for kids to not know what they're doing. Personally I don't find anything funny about incompetent, hopeless adults as portrayed in shows like the Office.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In retrospect this was a terrible strategy to stem the tide of lames. But...I must uphold my principles!

      I can't agree with the simplistic assumption that life really changes that much from when you were a teenager.  Sadly enough, I was probably more mature as a teenager, because I had a simpler view of the world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I always think back to an extremely intelligent and down-to-earth political philosophy professor I had in college, who, though he was in his 60's, was still in a band and wrote songs about angst, confusion and existential malaise.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
"That shit never ends" was his lesson.  I didn't really buy it at the time, but he was right.

      Are you saying that you are just as socially awkward now as you were when you were a teenager? That's...terrible. I agree that people often don't change as much as they think they do at a level of basic character or their "view of the world" as you put it, but it's crazy talk to judge teenagers on the same scale as fully grown people.

      I think adults are just better at hiding their awkwardness or, at least, feeling that they can.  Teenagers just tend to wear it on their sleeves. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Everyone I know still has insecurities and hang ups that occasionally interfere in social circumstances, but they're just not as obvious.  Some of these people are exceptionally charming and quite confident in most situations - but, still, given the right circumstances, a more complex angst and anxiety will arise than I've ever seen in a teenager. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Most people I know would say that I'm not socially awkward; quite the opposite.  But that doesn't change the fact that I feel like I'm constantly walking a thin line between civil conversation and just yelling "FUCK this" and walking out half of the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kinda like, you know, quitting assetbar (ooh burn).  As always, just kidding cailetshadow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And don't be ragging on the Office (British).  The cartoon-ish awkwardness of Napoleon Dynamite is likable and all, but that's just what it is - over the top.  The Office, while itself still cartoon-ish to an extent, captures the low points (and occasional high points) of adult life in a much more subtle and realistic manner. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or maybe we've just had two very different lives.

      Man, what the hell. Napoleon Dynamite is probably one of the most cleverly hilarious films out there. I watched it when I was quite a bit younger and didn't really like it because I basically didn't get a lot of the jokes. Then I watched it again this summer and I was like "Man... What was I thinking? This shit is cold  <em>funny</em> ." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think I'm going to watch it tonight, actually.

      I believe I said this elsewhere, but I really, really liked the movie. <br/>

For the first five minutes. <br/>

After that, I realized that was EXACTLY how I, and my children, and my children's children would have grown up if I had not moved away from North Carolina.

      Was it the part where Napoleon falls over the fence? I chuckled softly at that bit and then for the rest of the movie wondered why all my friends found it funny. <br/>

I don't like the awkward humour that's popular these days. It's like "hey let's put these characters into embarassing situations that are not funny in and of themselves but every few seconds the situation gets more inane so people will laugh at how ridiculous it is getting rather than anything anybody said or did that was actually funny"
