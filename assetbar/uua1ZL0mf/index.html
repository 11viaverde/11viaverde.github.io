      Arseloch. It means, literally and figuratively, "asshole". Such as "Fick mich in meinen Areseloch!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do not, however, know German in any legitimate manner. I only know English and Latin. This usually lets me bluff my way through other Romance languages, but when it comes to  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100204030541/https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/20595">the awful German language</a>  I'm largely just coasting on vague knowledge and no understanding of grammar.

      It is an amusing way to determine someone's comprehension of German as well as something that is most excellent when shouted passionately by a sexual partner (or whispered gently by a desired partner). <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is also one of the very few German phrases I know. I cannot ask where the bathroom is, but I can say that. Frankly, it seems the more useful phrase to understand.

      Pommes would be clear to anyone who had eaten American food in a country such as France or Belgium.  Brot could be inferred from the fact that it is bread and the sound is similar, or possibly he listens to Fettes Brot.  It is not necessary for him to know German to have this knowledge.

      It's been unmentioned that Ray received an e-mail from Bono. <br/>

There's a chance that Bono perhaps just sends out a bi-monthly newsletter to anyone who subscribes, but some things tell me that Bono sent that e-mail personally. <br/> <br/> <br/> (those somethings are 34 million albums)

      I've been to Germany several times, and usually get something like this when I'm there. A tip for you all... order the bread if you absolutely have to. Sometimes it'll be half a slice of dry, generic Wonderbread, but that's generally preferable compared to their fries. Think an extremely intense and unnatural yellow and a taste that suggests they were grown in a vat, rather than a field. Almost glow-in-the-dark (figuratively speaking, of course) if you're really unlucky. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But that doesn't matter, because their sausages kick all kinds of ass. Order an extra sausage and skip the bread/fries.

      I would put forth (having experienced it many times firsthand) that you are somewhat mistaken, ceres, at least in the general nature of your comment.  That is, the great majority of breads and beers (which are referred to colloquially in German as liquid bread: fluessiges Brot) are of the most rich and well made variety...my sympathies go to you if some vendor food left you dry, but go a few meters past the trainstation or whatnot and experience bread that is dense enough to be used as a blunt instrument in a murder, bread that makes you think of eternity.

      Went to Germany last year.  Report follows. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's basically a lot like America.  But with no graffitti and lots of Smartcars and Mercedes.  And windturbines.  They like American Hip Hop circa 2002. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fastfood service people definitely get snippy with you really quick.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
They are not really jazzed about giving it to you your way (even though it says it right there on the sign IN ENGLISH) at the Burger King on the Autobahn rest stop. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They serve soup at the Cologne Crown Plaza called "Rack of Bunny Soup".  You assemble it yourself from a tall glass of hot carrot broth, some roasted veggies and some mysterious piece of bunny on a skewer.  Way yummier than it looked or sounds. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Currywurst is just aiight.  (I totally ordered it just because of this strip.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Doners are  <em>awesome</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
At an "American" themed diner, they brought me a burger that was literally 1 pound.  And stuck a little American flag on top.  I guess they were editorializing. <br/>

I remember travelling through southern Germany and Austria for a few weeks in the late 80's as young kid.  It was always an adventure trying to order a hamburger at local inns and restaurants in the Black Forest and small Alpine villages.  Normally you'd get meatloaf with a piece of bread or something.

      My trip report: <br/> 
We asked the man in the ice cream cart outside the Berliner Dom where the best currywurst in the city was, and he told us (in perfect English) "Curry 36", and even pointed out subway stop we needed to get off at. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When we found the place it was indeed packed (on a Sunday!) but we worked our way to the front of the line and tried to order in manner Onstad taught us. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Things are never as easy as they are in webcomics. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Ein currywurst, bitte!" I said. But Herr Currwurst's reply was not what I had been trained to expect, and sadly (inevitably?) I was reduced to "Heh, what?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was later informed that his next query was not regarding the side dish, but rather what sort of bratwurst I wanted. (Skin or no skin? I'm not sure.) But a friend graciously took over and I sloped off to OD on fingernail schnapps. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Verdict: the curry powder really does add a certain something to the mix of ketchup and bratwurst pre-cut into little pieces, the way my mother used to do for me in kindergarten. Oh, and the pommes are delicious, despite what the guy above says. Curry 36: A           , would buy from again. <br/> <br/> <br/> As a sidenote, I realized while in Warsaw that my Polish vocabulary was identical to the Phillipe decision-making flowchart.
