      %u201CHis wife was all looking out their hole's dingy kitchen window with their 9 babies crying out of hunger behind her, with some pulling at her old, ragged dress: she sees him make his way across the kitchen counter coming back from work with that evening's groceries she%u2019d make one of her famous meals out of (%u201CI don%u2019t know what I%u2019d do if you weren%u2019t hear to feed me,%u201D the rat always said to her, lovingly). She smiles at him and he back at the only true love he's ever been known or wanted. With their eyes locked and with particles of love zipping back and forth, interchanging between their souls, he slips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
She, knowing he was gone, knowing she could not support her children alone and knowing she could never love again did what the insanity of the moment permitted her. She gets the family shot gun out of the cabinet (they only owned the weapon to get rid of a crack ridden squirrel that comes into their house when wasted and fucks furniture, singing songs that mostly consist of cursing and grunts. It%u2019s peculiar; they%u2019ve killed him most assuredly more than a few times but he always comes back. He once yelled something about a magical place called Friendly%u2019s while getting shot at that rat family has just never been able to decipher). She shoots all her children, indiscriminately. Then slowly and sobbing, she turns puts the barrel into her mouth and makes her final voluntary movement. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The father rat, with broken bones but a diamond hard soul, fights his way out of the trap, and struggles up to his home, limping with every leg. He opens his front door... <br/> 
 <br/> 
%u2018Send me a postcard, drop me a line <br/> 
Stating point of view <br/> 
Indicate precisely what you mean to say; <br/> 
Yours sincerely, wasting away!%u201D <br/>

      is an old, disabled veteran, miles from home, driving his electric wheelchair along the side of the freeway. The battery dies; he turns to face towards traffic, raises his thumb, and waits for someone to help him. No one stops. He waits; it becomes night. Its cold out. He continues waiting. Eventually he dies by the side of the road.

      That's my favorite part-- you can hear the CD rub as it spins up because a weight is pressing on the cheap top-loading CD player that is typically relegated to the kitchen.  <br/>

I also like the implication that there are several, room-specific rats.
