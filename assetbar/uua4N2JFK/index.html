      (I'm not really replying to this comment, but rather, this thread.) I find that people on Assetbar are pretty harsh and quick to lame people who have offended them in the past. I don't feel like Soticoto deserved to be lamed so hard for this comment (or at all really) and I think it happened because people are pre-judging based on previous comments of his that they didn't like. The same thing happens with Asherdan all the time too. It's kind of snotty...it's like there's a clique on this board or something.

      Women's naughty parts are all inside. Men have to deal with "the dangle factor." Everything we got is just out there exposed and swinging free. In order to make up for this vulnerability we assume masculine positions of bravado as though we don't care or are invulnerable.

      And testosterone is the hormone almost exclusively responsible for sex drive in men and women, which was part of the justification when the Western scientific community was pretending that men have higher sex drives than women (I ain't know why that ain't in fact true, ask Cornelius, I forget). <br/>

So the next time you hear some woman referring to her estrogen levels as a way of saying she's horny, look down your nose and correct her with repressed-yet-visible passion.

      I really hope you're pulling my leg, but in case you're not, and really don't know this stuff... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Accepting that we are working with broad generalizations, the age spread in which human males have stronger sex drives than human females is approximately thirty months long. For the rest of a biologically sexual life (by which I mean beginning at puberty), the female has a stronger sex drive (and typically goes through puberty some 18-24 months younger [and lives longer, just to be rude]). The thirty months in which a male has a stronger sex drive than the female happens to be the age, for a wealth of factors, at which he is largely physically incapable of controlling his orgasm. Fortunately, there are approximately one gadzillion books which advise young straight males on techniques by which one can compensate for the unfortunate atavism of premature ejaculation, allowing him to spend long enough in pre-coital stimulation to exhaust himself, and a wide variety of exciting images which will assist him in self-stimulation, should he need to achieve orgasm without a partner. These techniques will continue to serve him for the rest of his life, when he attempts to sexually please females with far, far greater sex drives than his own. Of course, his penis will eventually stop responding to traditional sexual stimulation, but there are pharmaceuticals which can assist with this unfortunate phenomenon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The human female's sexual organs, on the other hand, basically never stop responding to stimulation, although they eventually reduce self-lubricating. Some sixty years ago, the Great Men of Medical Science discovered that frigidity in females is almost nonexistent. Rather, a statistically significant minority of human clitorises are unusually removed from the vaginal wall, requiring manual stimulation for the female to orgasm. (You can test for this condition in your own home.) Most so-called cases of psychological were complete misdiagnoses, simply due to this unusual placement of tissue. While there are some females who are too nervous to achieve orgasm in the company of the gender to which they are attracted, almost all of them can achieve orgasm in private. For the very few exceptions, most of whom were the victims of pretty extreme childhood sexual trauma, there are counselors available in every major Western city, not to mention a wide variety of legal and illegal pharmaceuticals. Such counselors often find these women to find the term "preorgasmic" more conducive to sexual arousal than "frigid." <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I find it  <em>absolutely infuriating</em>  that you haven't been taught these things, and instead are learning them from some random Yank on the Internet; I would much prefer that you're kidding and I sound like an asshole. But it sounds like your ex-boyfriend didn't know them, either, and you should be as angry with his educators, not to mention yours. (That doesn't change the fact that you had to dump him, of course, but extremely rapid biological change without proper education  <em>invariably</em>  causes psychosis, and every male over twenty-one knows this firsthand.)

      Sadly, I wasn't joking. I mean, some of what you just said sounds kind of familiar - the fact that women have a longer sexual peak than men, or something (I think I heard than men reach their sexual peak at 17, and women in their thirties, but I could be making this up). And, I know that there's no such thing as being "frigid" - I was using that term in a relative amount of jest. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd just like to make a disclaimer that I'm not dumb - I've always been clever and it's only my severe laziness and lack of drive that's stopped me from getting As in school all the time. But, I don't know, I guess they just never teach this stuff. Probably deemed inappropriate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But you'd think they should make this information sort of more widely known. I mean, so many people are so insecure and messed up about sex, not just as teenagers but like throughout there lives. If information about it was sort of more readily available and seemed less obscure than having to get out weird books from the library or searching on the internet with the risk of coming across something you don't want to find, it would take away some of the negative mystique, maybe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Eh, sorry, babbling. Cheers for being informative.

      Ain't meant to call you dumb, and ain't meant to call you mean for using the term frigid. I (would have) graduated from high school a few years before Columbine, so I had about the most liberal education anyone's ever had from a public school. I knew that they stopped teaching about sex in the U.S. since (give any conservative a way to condemn violence, and they'll use it to condemn sex instead), I just had no idea the situation had gotten equally bad in the U.K., so don't mind me if I took a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101121051537/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=10262004">Robert Fripp</a>  tone. <br/>

      is this the first time molly meets showbiz?  at first i was confused as to why she wishes she had changed (my only thought being she wanted to change into something that covered her as much as possible because showbiz is a perv) - but then i realized that maybe she didn't know about how showbiz is a low life, and actually wanted to look nice...
