      Naw, it's not an arc. It's just some fellas who have come to a Decision.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
To contribute, about ten years ago they made a program that analyzed all of Mozart's symphonies and much of his other written music and "fabricated" another symphony of his, the 42nd. They played it for two groups of people - those who knew it was made by a machine and those who thought it was straight up Mozart. Those who thought it was Mozart thought it sounded wonderful. Those who thought it was a machine thought it was pure shit.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
There was probably a third group who thought they should be sitting around listening to Boy George instead of machine-made Mozart. That group was ignored.  <em>Until today.</em>

      That's interesting, but I think they failed to carry it out to its logical conclusion. We must perform this experiment with Kraftwerk. <br/>

      Yes. The members of Kraftwerk hate the Roomba component of their fan base. They register their disapproval the only way they know how: one hand playing a minor key with one finger, the other hand directing a steady stream of urine out of the flap in their jumpsuits.

      i must hear The Most Unwanted Song!  it sounds amazing!  <br/>

i love this part: "An operatic soprano raps and sings atonal music, advertising jingles, political slogans, and "elevator" music, and a children's choir sings jingles and holiday songs." <br/>

meanwhile, The Most Wanted Song sounds like it was just ripped off of Rob Thomas's latest album.   <br/>

      You can listen to them both  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144506/https://www.ubu.com/sound/komar.html">here</a> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
I found the Most Unwanted  <em>much</em>  more listenable - the satirical lyrics and kitchen sink instrumentation in the soprano's verses recall The United States of America (the one-album band, not the country.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
The children's choir praising Jesus, Mary, and Wal-Mart in the same breath, now  <em>that</em>  recalls the country.

      I think you might be confusing the United States of America with The  <em>Presidents</em>  of the United States of America.  They are two different bands, separated by much time and space. <br/>

      Dave Barry established years ago that the Most Unwanted Song (winning for General Badness and Worst Lyrics BOTH) was "MacArthur Park." I mostly concur. Few songs would be improved by a video of Father Guido Sarducci singing them in Italian (IN the actual MacArthur Park).

It is entirely criminal to compare Little Britain to Black Books in any way, let alone a favourable one. It's not worthy.

      professorhazard, I quake at the responsibility you have laid at my feet. If I cannot find the answers to my most troubling queries in the Achewood forum, then what hope is there for me in this world? What hope, indeed? <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the original note; the back-up singer that sings Boy George in the 'Wedding Singer' is the Arquette of which I speak. She was born a man, but became a woman... at least that is what I was led to believe by watching the Surreal Life. I could be mistaken, though. I also believed the Urban Legend that Jamie Lee Curtis was born a hermaphrodite; I recently read that she was, in fact, a woman from day one.

I am sorry that I can't make all your decisions for you, donward2, but seeing as your ambiguous gender of "Hip Server" leaves me unable to determine whether or not it would delight you to have a floppy she-male cock in your life, I just don't feel that I am in possession of enough data to shake or nod my head in that great loud dance club of telling you to Get Some.

      Ah, I saw 'hip server' as being a cool Acheworld way of saying "I'm a dude who loves the ladies, and would like to broadcast it to all the available honies who may find some joy in my 'not quite unique' avatar of a cartoon cat who is the main character of the comic of which forum I member of. Come and get it." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can understand the confusion however.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Meat and Potatoes of my question is this: <br/> 
Is it not normal for a 92.7% hetero man to think that a transgendered woman (male to female) is attractive? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still think that she is a good looking lady for her age (which I estimated to be early forties) and I think that I would probably hit it, but in my naivety it never occured to me if this would be frowned upon by the general population.

      Actually now that you mention it, I wonder how many decks Gambit was/is prone to haul around?  Standard jeans can probably pack around three per front pocket, but he still needs to carry his wallet and keys.  He also seems like a bit of a holster kind of guy, and i think he pulled them from his sleeves sometimes.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, when Gambit plays poker, does he ever accidentally charge up his entire hand by force of habit?

      I was thinking one pack in each pocket (two at the side, two at the back), with one maybe kept in hand instead of in the pocket. <br/>

As to poker playing, I think the answer is no, because if he did, no-one would play poker with him.

      I always imagined Gambit pulling his cards from the inside pockets of his trenchcoat, or his sleeves, as you mentioned.

      Yes, but if I'm not mistaken, his charge was only a knietic energy charge. Therefore if he were to use objects with more mass, i.e. a hammer, then he would need fewer projectiles to do more damamge. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, by carrying the 209 hammers that a pair of standard jeans are capable of carrying, then Gambit would be able to turn any Middle Eastern country into a democracy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus, I could never get my cards to fly straight and on target, so playing as Gambit in the backyard always led to me getting my ass kicked by my friend who would always play as Wolverine.  <br/>

      It has often occurred to me that Gambit could have been completely unstoppable if he'd just spent 15 minutes in a Modell's in 1992. Cards may have panache, but imagine if he was rolling with a bandolier of Aerobies, and maybe a Foxtail strung to his belt for mortar-type purposes? Of course there's always the chance he might replace the trench coat with a closeout Shawn Kemp jersey, but it's  <em>equally</em>  possible he'd end up with some Bo Jackson apparel. Awesome.

      This is true. But even if it is the case, then it's irrelevant to the start of the discussion, which was about how comfortable the chair looked. <br/>

      Not to be the guy who won't stop beating the dead horse, but I must interject that my point does remain - that chair may be a poolside lounge chair, such as one that always makes you feel like it will collapse under you if you put your full weight back on it - and at some times, it is inside the house. <br/>

      As his thought flow chart indicates, a lot of Ray's mind works in loops. Very little if anything is every learned. <br/>

I'd say about 60% of Achewood arcs involve him thinking up a new completely ridiculous business plan, and then trying to follow through before becoming distracted. The boy just don't have much common sense.

      Roast Beef has done some rude things on cocaine. Like making a business plan for a restaurant chain that would compete with Ramono's Macaroni Grill by featuring a waterfall in the main dining area. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is because adding waterfalls to things is an essential part of making bad decisions about being high on cocaine.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or perhaps waterfalls are cocaine's contribution to the world?

At least he wrote a song about an African American lady in the south during the 1800s. There arent too many of those.

      Beef saying "Fuckin' A!" troubled me for two reasons. The first being that my achefriends will assume I am quoting him whenever I say it from now on (and I say it alot); and that seeing that amount of capitalisation and punctuation in such a small amount of Beef's dialogue makes it seem somehow... Less Beef. Perhaps in his excitement he has momentarily forgotten how cripplingly depressing most of his life has been. I'd like to think so.

      I tell you what xiaomimi, you got some serious stamina posting all those blogs links. Presuming you're not getting paid by Onstad it's a fine service you have provided to Assetbar, and all for little digital bundles of love called  <em>Chubbies</em> . Or perhaps it's an effort to swing the  <em>Interweb Karma</em>  your way. Whatever the reason,  <strong>I salute you.</strong>
