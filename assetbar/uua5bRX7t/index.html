      If you only had one glass, you would have to keep getting out of the bath to mix yourself another drink and fill it up. This way, he can premix 7 martinis and get smashed without leaving the comfort of the tub!

      I have done this with wine, beer, and scotch. Just sittin in the tub, reading and getting a little slanted.  <br/>

      Sitting in the shower IS awesome. Also, if you're really bored, re-enacting all the great dramatic rain scenes from your favorite movies is also a lot of fun. <br/>

Another thing I do in the morning shower sometimes - I crouch and bow my head, assuming the Arnold Schwarzenegger pose from when he first gets sent back in time in Terminator, and then I slowly rise to a standing position while going " BA DUM BUM BADUM. BA DUM BUM BADUM."  <br/>

      I've been trying to spread a rumor: lying down in a shower while you masturbate will make you ejaculate twice as much, because the jism is trying to defeat the force of the water. Also, if you have sex with a pig, the orgasm lasts for half an hour, and all black people really like riding faster buses and will run for the faster bus.

      Totally different direction, but you know what else is awesome?  Lay down in the shower and let the tub slowly fill up.  It is a very pleasing sensation to go from little pellets of water hitting your skin directly to the pellets hitting the accumulated water along your skin.
