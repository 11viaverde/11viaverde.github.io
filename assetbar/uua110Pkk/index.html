      For a punker, Leander looks the least punk of all punkers I've ever seen. Even the pop-punk bands pull it off  <em>accidentally</em>  when they wear eyeliner.

      Ok, there's no reason both of you can't be wrong! <br/> 
soilentshuggah, Your description of hardcore results from Minor Threat being one of the only hardcore bands you're familiar with. What you're describing after "sometimes" is [i]straight-edge[/], which is a totally seperate genre. Yes, it started with hardcore, but let's keep them distinct. The vast majority of hardcore bands are just fine with drinking and/or drugs. Let's not forget the genre was started by Black Flag and the Bad Brains. And clintisiceman, hardcore was specifically developed by bands who also like the "heavy" angle to the metal movement. It kept close musical ties with the thrash metal scene, and resulted in many crossovers such as S.O.D.m, the "skater punk" scene, and eventually grindcore. And yes, this comic is great.

      You are right, of course. There were the whole grindcore and crust and crossover thrash things going on and I was wrong to imply that hardcore and metal were completely isolated from one another. What I think I was trying to say (and it's been a while, so my meaning may be lost even on myself) is that metal had no real direct influence on the foundation of hardcore. The idea was just punk rock taken to the extreme, played real fast and loud and sloppy. The idea put on the table that hardcore was the result of punk bands thinking they should put elements from metal in their music bothered me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But as I have said in another reply, I was totally being a dick about terms and was definitely being a cock to a stranger, which is not something that should happen later. <br/>

 <em>For those of you who remember Pete Gibbons, congrats are in order.  His lovely wife Jan is pregnant again!  If the baby is anything like it's dad, it'll probably be late! This week's competition is - guess who the father is! Ha ha, only joking Pete.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who don't remember Gibbo, he was with us from 1989 to 2000, but took voluntary redundancy to deal with troubles in his marriage.  Let's hope <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">this</span> baby brings them closer together.</em> <br/>

      I remember Pete Gibbons. Man, that guy was a barrel of laughs. One time he came to work early and replaced the coffee in the Maxwell House tin with dirt! It was hilarious to see the look on the boss's face when he took that first sip of mud. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What a guy, Pete Gibbons.

      I actually kind of more envisaged a somewhat Ferris Buelle-esque mechanism, in which upon the door being opened a wire trips such as a tape recorder or computer program which generates the recognisable sound of Beef's nervous retches.

      The blog used to be written by Barry Best, but now it is written by Barry King. Onstad saw the same mistake I saw, and he did something about it. He wants history to wash over this error, but no small detail escapes the keep eyes of the ever-watchful Achewood nerd.

      Teodor is wearing his original shirt instead of the sweater Penny made for him. I think he has worn only that sweater since he got it, except when he's doing Parkour or running around the house naked.
