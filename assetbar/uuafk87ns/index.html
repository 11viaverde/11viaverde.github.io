      Was I hopped off the Dane-Train (sorry) I think it was just because I got bored of him, but he was still popular.  I didn't realize that a whole movement of Dis-Dane (sorry again) was brewing.  I never thought he would be compared to the likes of Carrot Top *shudder*.  I mean, the guy's pretty funny, or at least he used to be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also we don't watch much baseball up here in the frigid North, maybe that has something to do with it. I get just about enough baseball from watching shitty country singers twang out "The Braves Play Here" on PeachTree TV when I'm trying to watch The Office.

      "Frigid North?" "The Braves Play Here?" I'm all kinds of confused about all that. <br/>

      You know what, I'm confused too. By frigid North I mean Canada.  There is very little baseball in Canada, at least in my neck of the woods.  And PeachTree TV is the station that replaced TBS Superstation for us up here. I guess it's broadcast from Atlanta so they always have advertisements for Braves games, sung by country singers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Side note, we are currently carrying on two separate assetbar conversations on two separate strips.  One about Dane Cook, the other about porn.  I take it your work day is proceeding similarly to mine.

      Bizarre. Yeah, between the mention of the Braves and "PeachTree" I thought you were just in a particularly frigid northern section of Georgia (hence my confusion). That's fucked up that they show Braves games in Canada. I was under the impression that most of you didn't even care about the Blue Jays, much less a similarly underachieving team from thousands of miles away. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And yes, I'm doing whatever I can to pass the time on the clock, up to and including talking baseball, mediocre stand-up comedians and eternally bouncing tits with a random Canuck on the internet. It's a living.
