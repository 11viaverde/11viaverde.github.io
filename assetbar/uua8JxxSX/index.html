      I promise you that someday I will use the line in the last panel. It will be when I want somebody to quit, and that want will not be unjustified at all. Don't get me wrong, no man should ever be a cock to his employees... unless of course one of those employees is being a cock.

      I think Carl Weathers shot himself when the arm in which he was holding an automatic weapon was blown off with a laser-type projectile and continued to fire.  <br/> 
Either that or he just plain got his arm blown off by a laser-type projectile. That'll do it.

      Wrong wrong  <em>wrong !</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I got suddenly all riled up because somebody misrepresented my favourite movie.  As someone who's watched  <em>Predator</em>  at least 14 times and can quote every single word... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Carl Weathers - or rather, the character Major George Dillon - went in search of the Predator holding two sub-machineguns.  Armed with one and the other being a backup, he did indeed have his arm blown off by the Predator's laser-sighted shoulder cannon.  The severed arm, still firing weapon, falls to the ground.  In a panic and screaming, Dillon reaches around with his still-attached arm and grabs his spare sub-machine gun and commences firing at the semi-invisible assailant*. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We then see the alien, cloaked transparently, running toward Dillon, and (in a moment of plot inconsistency that I don't give a fuck about) his wrist blades come out visibly, and then proceed to impale Dillon post-haste. <br/> 
 <br/> 
[/b] <em>There is no spatchcocking involved</em> [/b] <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only people to be anything  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">close</span>  to spatchcocked on camera would be, yes, Billy (whom had his skull and spine ripped out as a trophy, due to his badass-ness as an adversary), Lieutenant Jim Hopper and two unnamed US soldiers (off-camera, and prior to storyline beginning - all that is found is their skinned bodies hanging from a tree).  All other victims also have their skull and vertebrae trophied from memory, but only Billy is seen to have this done on-camera. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This could possibly be considered spatchcocking, however for the opposite purpose as their bodies are not then butterflied out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh yes, I got that pedantic about this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*Semi-invisible?  Yes, semi-invisible.

      That's not Billy, it was Hawkins, the glasses guy with shit jokes.  Billy the indian cut his chest open in direct conflict with something ninety times his weight-class.  Unless you mean when the Predator staight-up fucks-up Billy on the log, all lifting him up.  But it was completely Hawkins, or perhaps one of those pinko motherfuckers, that the Predator drops the cerebrum on the jungle floor.

 <em>Although a handful of Asian giant hornets can easily defeat the defenses of many individual honey bees, whose small stings cannot inflict much damage against such a large predator, the Japanese honey bee (Apis cerana japonica) has evolved a collective defence.</em> <br/>

      So one day there was this kid, punk type, hot pink mohawk and enough piercings to set off security alarms, riding a subway in New York. Old man, tightly dressed, quite respectable, gets on at one stop, sits down in front of the kid, and spends the next few minutes just staring at him. Now usually it's a shocked glare from passing mothers that the kid gets, so he's finally like, "Hey old man, what are you staring at? Didn't you do anything completely crazy when you were my age?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
The old man pauses, and says, <br/> 
"Yes, yes I have. When I was in the South Pacific in The War, my Navy buddies and I got drunk one night, blind drunk, and though I'm not proud of itt, I screwed a bird of paradise. <br/> <br/> <br/> "I was wondering if you were my son."

      that's so true.  Spatchcocked chicken -- a technical sort of chicken, much less friendly than butterflied chicken, and with less in the way of multimedia properties (let's face it, a spatchcocked chicken makes for a shitty video), whereas the butterflied chicken is beautiful on the outside but suffers from wide-ranging compatibility issues.  (There are many spatchcock sauces for which it is simply impossible to find a butterfly equivalent.) <br/> 
Oh, and spatchcocked chickens often get diseases, but only because being a butterfly chicken disease is an evolutionary dead end.

      This reminds me of the time we had a seminar  on various IT tools. There was a quiz we could take along with it, which I thought was worthless because they gave out the answers one by one, but no, we actually had to turn them in at the end.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was unable to hand mine in because my quiz was covered in a complex cartoon in which Mrs. Pacman left Pacman for a handsome gardener she met at the gym because Pacman had become an abusive, raving drunk. It's really hard to draw Pacman passed out on the floor, what with how he's 2D and all.  <br/>

I think I asked for another because I said I wrote my notes all over this one. <br/>

      I don't mean to sound like the grammar police, but I feel that clarification is needed here.  Flair and flare are homophones, words that sound the same, but have different meanings. <br/> 
 <br/> 
flare (noun) <br/> 
1) a flaring or swaying flame or light, as of torches in the wind. <br/> 
2) a sudden blaze or burst of flame.  <br/> 
3) a bright blaze of fire or light used as a signal, a means of illumination or guidance, etc.  <br/> 
4) a device or substance used to produce such a blaze of fire or light. <br/> 
 <br/> 
flair (noun) <br/> 
1) a natural talent, aptitude, or ability; bent; knack  <br/> 
 <strong> 2) smartness of style, manner, etc. </strong> <br/> 
 <strong> Synonyms: chic, dash, panache, verve; oomph, pizazz. </strong> <br/>

Actually, it's perfectly okay to split an infinitive.  The only reason that it has been taboo in the past is that English grammarians back in the 19th century were trying to line English up a little more with Latin, which was considered a "high" language (despite its being dead).  In Latin, it is impossible to split an infinitive, since Latin infinitives are single words.  Therefore, it really makes no sense to be trying to conform our grammar to that.

      I mean, I'm just speculating here. Normally, you'd say "That's a lot of beef", like "That's a lot of sheep", but when you're talking about something  <em>named</em>  Beef, then don't different rules for plurals apply? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd hazard that it's beeves, unless you're Philippe, who will call it beefs to illustrate the fleeting, majestic delicacy of childrens' speech.

      I like  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145857/https://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/">Ctrl-Alt-Del</a> , and of course, XKCD and Dinosaur Comics. <br/> 
 <br/> 
plus also, if Dino gets into this Achewood referencing gig, i will call the game on account of everybody playing on the same team. it will come to light that the authors are all Good friends and all decided to make cross-references (though they've yet to appear in this comic) or that it's really only one person that draws them all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i mean uh...CONSPIRACY! BLACK HELICOPTERS! ILLUMINATI! ETC!

      Man, I love webcomics. <br/> 
I tried to get my brother into Achewood, but he refuses to read through the archives until I watch Sideways (which I saw part of and found it suicidally boring), so he says he won't read more Achewood until I watch it. Can you believe it! I've been trying for about two months now, and so far he's only read up to Teodor's party, and he thinks Roast Beef is emo. HOW CAN ANYONE USE SUCH A CLICHE TO DESCRIBE BEEF!? How can I make him see the piece of genius that is Achewood? Tips from people who've been there please? <br/> 
Also, I tried to get my best friend to read xkcd, but as she was reading, she kept giving me quizzical looks and asking how it's funny. I just gave up on her. I want to spread the gospel of Achewood to her too, but I feel like...I don't know...like she doesn't  <em>deserve</em>  it, you guys know what I'm talking about, right? Especially after the xkcd thing. <br/> 
*sigh* I'm surrounded by plebians.

      Maybe you could get really high and watch 'Sideways' in a state of blissful transcendance.  But who can say whether your brother will ever get achewood?  Maybe the two of you need to sit down and have a deep philosophical discussion about these important matters.

      Yes, Sideways does get funny/good, especially if you watch it as a drinking game: every time someone onscreen drinks, you drink.  Waterfalls for every postcard montage of upstate California.  Not its everytime someone says, "Merlot."  I recommend beer for this drinking game, but a mixed drink such as a gin and tonic is also good.

Sideways was set, and filmed, in what most people would term Southern California, in the wine country near Santa Barbara (Santa Ynez Valley); not the more famous Napa etc. region of the north. <br/>

Maybe I'm just a callous, uncaring penis-haver, but I still don't understand why it's such a "problem" that Achewood doesn't have an equal number of equally awesome female characters. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like arguing the unfairness that Santa Claus is a man, and implying that everything would be better if he were a Pat-like* hermaphrodite. Or at least liked to play tranny once in awhile. <br/>

      I know! I was checking to see if anyone else posted the fact that Achewood was Catandgirlified. <br/> 
Did you know that Cat And Girl led me to Achewood? <br/> 
It's true! <br/> 
Gather 'round, children as a spin a tale of mystery, passion, deceit, and  <em>murder!</em> <br/> 
So, one day I was bored and looking for comics. I saw many sucky ones on the Interweb, with mostly dudes as the main...dudes. So I decided to Google "girl comic". I was pleased to find a lovely comic full of obscure references and an anthropomorphic cat. Re-reading the archives, I came apon the strip where Cat and Girl take a trip to the '90s. I suddenly had the urge to Google Images the phrase "'90s", where saw the amazing sight of the xkcd comic in which they show a flowchart mentioning the 90's. After reading those archives, I was hungry for more comics, so I followed xkcd's recommendation that I look at achewood, and my life has been fabulous ever since.

      So is Teodor a dreamer or a loser? We know he has various skills, but he seems like the sort of person that genuinely believes that he's one day going to be successful, but never actually achieves that success due to procrastination/losing interest. Being certain of his success let's him feel superior to others despite never actually achieving anything himself. This is someone that imagined that he was discouraged from pursuing a career in gay porn because he would have overshadowed his mentor. <br/> 
Friends and family accept this stance into your mid-twenties but gradually lose respect for you as it becomes increasingly apparent to everyone but yourself that you're never going to really achieve anything of note. <br/> 
I am Teodor, and even knowing this I can't stop being Teodor.

      I like to think "conversing in Manfleshing" is something that can only occur within the precise boundaries of Assetbar, in a very special set of circumstances. Namely, Manflesh's birthday. <br/> 
By the by, on and unrelated thought, I am eagerly looking forward to the day he is Manflesh, GP. That, my friends, is both its blessing and its curse. <br/> 
Also, Ted Leo. For some reason.

      On the Assetbar sidebar, under "My Profile" there should be a link to your Ignore List- it leads to a page with the option to un-ignore people.
