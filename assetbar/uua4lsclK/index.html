      Naw, it's just silly. And I can see a shaggy dog story unfolding here, no great epic, but.... <br/> 
 <br/> 
You probably know better than I how Gordon will flambe' a chef- honestly, I've only watched 1 or 2 episodes, but I'm guessing he does it regularly. <br/> 
My mom's getting old now, 82, and she's always spoken her mind. She and my dad (84) are on what she calls "Green Bananas Time".  <br/> 
 Last month, one of my 3 sisters, all who live out of state, emailed me with the idea that I could arrange a dinner date at a nice restaurant for their 60th anniv., and my sisters would fly/drive in secretly and be there when we arrived. I live 1 town over, 15 minutes away from my folks, so I'm nominally the one who keeps an eye on them. Lately we've gotten into the habit of my wife and I taking them out occasionally for a meal, so it would be no big deal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Okay, so a choice of 2 upscale restaurants in town. The main one I know the owner ( and by extension, the chef, sorta) because I worked on the place when they were remodeling for the opening some 5 years ago. I think it was the last remodel job I did. The owners older brother is an old friend of mine, still a hippie after all these years (and what I know of this dude's life would be an interesting read). He was begging me to come help him finish the remodel in time, (and I'd gone back to school for an I.T. degree)  <br/> 
 <br/> 
[Weird divergence: I just saw in the paper the other night that the owner/chef of the "Other" restaurant, The Diner, also in Norman- (which was featured on The Food Network in November) passed away. Undoubtedly from years of rich food & drink. I knew his family, and his older brother, KIA, Christmas Day 1968,in Vietnam, and surgeon uncle played an integral part in me not being inducted) this weirds me out]  <br/>

      The phrase "I'm as serious as a heart attack" has worked its way into my lexicon unnoticed. I've never used it when refering to flatulence, though.

      Presumably, if the power went out, Lyle would need a flashlight. But unless he tied it up somehow, he'd have to hold the magazine in one hand and the flashlight in the other, leaving masturbation almost totally out of the question. <br/>

Why can't he just lay the fucking magazine down on any flat surface?

      These thoughts are contained in the ellipsis. But you're right: I over-thought one area too far and ignored the other areas altogether. I am like the world's worst sound guy, attempting to work the equalizer of the modern argument.
