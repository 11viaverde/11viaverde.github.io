To be Frank, I'm pretty sure I see Pat's food down at Seattle's Best Coffee about once a month. There's a buffer gap of about a foot before and in front of him in the line.

      I agree. I just started on a diet to try and lose my beer gut, and I've been eating all sorts of healthy stuff. Chicken breast, if seasoned well, is both healthy and crazy-delicious. I am, however, still unsure of how I feel about eating raw spinach. Eating stuff that looks like I've just gone and picked leaves off a bush makes me feel foolish.

      Okay, so the other night I baked some chicken legs (I like dark meat). I put the chicken in a pan and sprinkled some paprika on it. Then I heated some cream of mushroom soup and when it finally resembled soup instead of can-shaped gelatin, I poured it over the chicken, then baked it for like an hour. It was great. The soup cooked and formed kind of a second skin for the chicken.

      Not bad, but you could'a baked the chicken in soup with some rice, and that would produce a different dish -- maybe better with boneless breasts.  Some celery and carrot chunks, too, mmmmm.

      No, that's not remotely healthy. <br/>

Try marinating chicken thighs in a mixture of butter, olive oil, soy sauce, garlic, and rosemary. <br/>

That's not remotely healthy, either. But it's simple and I like it.

      No, he brought the best-itutes for Ray to "try."  He didn't bring Ray packages of food to stock his kitchen with, he is going to portion out exactly one half tablespoon of his superior food, then pack it back up and remove it from Ray's slovenly presence.  Because he is Pat.

      I have always thought that about her.  People don't notice.  She could be in like an elite club of musicians who are secretly awesome at guitar but nobody talks about them that way, along with David Byrne, uh, how about J. Mascis, and I suppose there must be plenty more but now I can't think of them.

      Ani DiFranco is the female Dave Matthews. An eternity of guitar plucking and poetry that should have remained on a coffee-stained napkin is what she is. Also, plenty of people love J. Mascis, how do you think he got his own branded Fender?

      P.S.  I don't like Ani Difranco, I just grudgingly admit she is good and even kind of original at guitar.  I hate even worse to half-admit the same of Dave Matthews, but here I am, half-admitting it.  Damnit.

      Dave Matthews was excellent once. Ani Difranco, as can be expected from a ludicrously prolific recording artist really should be leaving some of the poetry on the coffee stained napkin and some of those notes unplucked. There is bound to be shit amoung the gold.

      Yes. I dearly love Ani DiFranco (as well as Chris Smither, and other underappreciated guitarists), but I agree that it is extremely impossible to find an artist of any sort whose entire body of work I completely love. The more prolific they are, the more of their work I am bound to dislike. I think it's a mark of distinction if I can find a whole  <em>CD</em>  I can listen to without wanting to skip any tracks.
