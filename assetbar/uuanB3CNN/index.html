      You don't really need to say "this panel" with Family Circus, because there's only one panel, much like you don't need to specify which character, because there's really only on character.

      They could redeem the whole decades-long series and turn it into a long buildup for one punchline if he ends the series with a comic that's just Jeffy's face filling up the whole panel, saying "You should always do what God says, right grandpa!" and above the flames reflected in his eyes a thought bubble would read "Yes Jeffy, they're all with me now."

      Beef has displaced his feelings about Molly and his life to the AIBO. I would think that because the AIBO is a thing, he feels less vulnerable about expressing his love of it. Therefore he fights for the AIBO because Molly meant too much for him to even speak about it. While it's one thing to love someone, it's quite another to tell that person or someone else, and even moreso to publicly do something about it. Specially for Beef.  <br/>

      But there's a big difference between something inanimate that you get happiness from and a person you open yourself up to. Inanimate objects, pets, hobbies, things like that do not ever go wrong and you can't let them down, so there is never a low point in that relationship and when you have Depression, that is a big deal and very defendable. But when you're vulnerable to someone, they can hurt you just as much as they help, if not more so, because that tends to be the most important relationship and the very idea of it not working is cataclysmic and paralyzing--imagine losing grip on your life preserver because you are weak and can't hold on tight enough, and when you let go the life preserver floats vigorously away from you. It's not that Weldon is better for Beef than Molly because he can stand up for himself; if anything, it proves that Molly means that much more to him because Depression tends to make it so that rolling over and dying about a person is a tender sentiment.

      The Roast Beef Redemption, part two.  He never thought he was good enough for Molly, but Weldon gives him the unconditional love he never had before.  And for the first time in his life, Roast Beef has a little self-esteem.  And God help anyone who tried to keep him in Circumstances after that.  Although I agree he's not beating her up, just banging on the door.  "Punching an old lady" sounds would be considerably wetter.

      Xiaomimi you are doing a service to this community and it is nice to be here while you just get down and do the stuff that the higher ups really could stand to be taking care of themselves.  You.  Are.  Rad.

      RAD spiderman.  I just started re-reading that shit what with the political process being of interest lately in my country.  It just gets better every time and particularly so when one's own electoral passions are all het up, I've found.

      I've never actually read it during election fever. I have been planning to bring it back out soon for another re-read myself, though, so that'll fix that. I'm also very anxious to see if it's in line for the "Absolute" mega-expensive hardback treatment that DC has been doing for Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Sandman, Dark Night, etc. Despite the price tag, I'd gladly trade in the unwieldy set of 11 skinny paperbacks for 2 or 3 big hardbacks. Oh, and yes, it definitely gets better and better with each read. The story and the art are both so complicated that there's always more to notice... RAD, indeed.

      There comes a time where you cannot push a man any further, and Beef has come to that time. I love the slow shift in Beef's character, from the cat who ain't Ray or Pat to the milquetoast guy on the moon to the guy who speaks for the belittled everywhere.
