      From what I've experienced, there are two long, almost like bolts, on the top and bottom of school bus doors, that can be popped into the open position to allow you to open the door from the outside. Then its just a matter of opening it from the bottom.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've also heard of a button marked for emergency "exit" on the outside of the door that drivers will use to close/open it from the outside.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
My grandmother was a bus driver, When I went to school she was long retired but a friend of hers still did it, and she actually drove my route throughout middle-school.

      Onstad is apologizing for the content of his comic strip in a way that implies he has no control over the actions of the characters within.  <em>Nice.</em>
