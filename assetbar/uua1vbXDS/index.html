      Weird thing is the Bible says nothing about Onan doing that; he just did not want to plant his seed in his dead brother's wife, because that would give his dead brother an heir, so he prematurely withdrew. <br/>

      Or about one day of a priest trying to make sure God said masturbation was wrong. Because that's obviously what God meant. I mean, duh. Any priest can tell you that masturbation is a sin. Just because that doesn't seem to have anything to do with what is written in the book doesn't mean that the bible is always contorted into whatever meaning most justifies and reassures the popular views!
