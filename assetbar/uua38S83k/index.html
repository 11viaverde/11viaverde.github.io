      ... And would you have any clue how to undo such a thing?  <br/> 
Does it make a difference that I saw a short remark of his a while ago, so presumably I don't have the guy himself on complete ignore?  <br/>

Either way, his absence makes me sad. =(

      Y'know what's funny? I've read the entire archives through, the day somebody recommended Achewood to me. Then, I noticed there were comments, and I read  <em>those</em>  through. I've come to see a strange, polarizing trend: the swing of Asherdan's popularity. For a while, I thought he was the most horrible guy ever- but then, this happened. Why? What's going on? I haven't seen a change in his style of writing, or the content therein. In fact, it doesn't seem as if he, himself, cares that there is a change, he keeps on doing his own damn thing. I'm halfway through my assetbar trawl, so I have a feeling that opinions will swing in ways unpredicted from here on out... I'll check back in a month to make sure that I've been lamed out of continuity for posting this at the very top, as an assurance that things are still the way they are supposed to be. Cheers!

      You'd thing for a guy who knows his science, Beef would be a bit more impartial about Einstein's contributions to physics - it's not like doing the research that leads to a certain invention is morally equivelant to being responsible for the deaths caused by that invention. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess Beef just thinks that way though. You can't expect someone who has such as depression to really be an expert on ethics like that. He sees the worst in everyone.
