      I got the impression that Beef and Chevy have known each other for a while, and that they are something of friends. I figured that, ya know, it was just buddies messing with each other, and Beef doesn't even bother to respond, cause they aren't even insults.

      Odds of Beef  <em>not</em>  getting married to Molly are now 1:100 against and falling, I'd reckon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Half-hitch for a brain" and most of Chevy's dialogue from panel 5 earn honorable mention from me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I believe that "Chevy Ford Wo" is a reference to Edsel Ford Fong, the rudest waiter ever to bring an order of chow fun to a diner. (His brother was named Henry--his dad dug Fords, apparently.) Fong held court at  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101006174938/https://www.fudcourt.com/samwo.html">Sam</a>   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101006174938/https://viewsbythebay.blogspot.com/2003/12/sam-wo-813-washington-san-francisco.html">Wo</a> , an exceptionally cheap Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, San Francisco. I went there a while ago, and have little to add to the reviews in the links (not having visited in Edsel's heyday) except that, well, you see that dumbwaiter in the second link? It's manually operated, and the waitress on the second floor needed to signal to the kitchen when she wanted to send down empty plates. She did this with a buzzer, and she didn't use a button to activate it--she touched together the bare ends of two copper wires. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101006174938/https://www.dph.sf.ca.us/eh/Violations/Loc_CurrentViol.asp?LocationID=1688">report</a>  of the San Francisco Department of Public Health may also be of interest.

      I think you're right!  Especially since Onstad is from SF :)  Edsel passed on about 10 years ago but I ate in Sam Wo's a year ago and his son (I think?) is carrying on his tradition. <br/> 
I think if Edsel were here today, he would appreciate the homage of being an asian stereotyped cat.

      "Odds of Beef not getting married to Molly are not 1:100 against and falling..." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I dunno.  Onstad is a clever bastard.  He could be overselling the marriage thing, so that when Beef gets stood up at the aisle we're all sent into such a spiral of angst and depression that our only available solace is the mass-consumption of Achewood merchandise.

      It's funny to me so many people are upset by the phonetic arrangement of this chinese food proprietor's speech, yet so few were turned off by Onstad referring to his child's birth as witnessing "a dead booger that learned how to scream".

      If Chevy Ford Wo is based off of SF's Edsel Ford Fong (see tellumo's comment way above), which is extremely likely, then it's not racism.

      Oh, I didn't even see that! Man, I hate the way this thing just arbitrarily truncates images without even putting you on notice. The fact that they give you a scroll bar  <em>that doesn't even scroll all the way across the image</em>  is a special touch. I can see how you don't want to let griefers post massive images just to make the page wider, but that scroll bar business is pure Marquis de Sade. <br/>

      Well I'm not too invested in this, so let's not battle, and i'm ignoring the word "foreign", but since at least "The Birth of a Nation". The problem is that "dialect-typing" often goes beyond anything like transcribing phonemes, and starts to exist just to signify the outsider status of the speakers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even when it is just accurately transcribing sounds, it isn't *neutral*. As an example, most people who speak something close to a recognizeably "standard" form of American English don't make any "t" sounds when they say the word "little", but only certain variations ever merit a dialect-signifying change like "lil". <br/> 
 <br/> 
But just to reiterate this isn't a post intended to start a fight. I don't think the practice is inherently racist exactly, just that it isn't neutral.

 <br/> 
Stagger Lee: (In a Southwestern American accent--widely agreed upon by news professionals as being accentless regardless of the fact that it still  differs from British English or "true" English in that Americans will often "clip" words or run them together e.g. "onna" instead of "on a," and usually pronounce vowels more quickly and without the drawl similar to the Southern American accent--different, of course, in that the British will pronounce the consants more crisply while Southern Americans will tend to carry the vowel into the consonant) Yes.

 <br/> 
As a chinese-australian gentleman, I found the dialogue given to Mr. Ford Wo by C.O to be simultaneously hilarious and true. I don't think that Onstadt is intimating that all asian people speak like this at all: clearly this is simply a gentle parody of an angry, abrasive, yet ultimately wise waiter character. moreso since it is apparently based on a real person. I have personally heard many chinese people speak like this, especially those of the first-generation immigrant variety. then again, many do not.  <br/>

this is just a funny strip, guys. don't read more into it than is there.

      If you are one of the people crying "racist", I didn't lame you. But I do disagree. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray has said the "n" word once, even though it's never been established that Ray has a particular "race". He always professes to be French, if you'll recall. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The KKK, when they called Beef looking for Jamie the science friend, used the word in reference to a Harvard minstrel show. Though, that is the KKK, it's not uncharacteristic of them to use hate speech.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Envelope Martinez, Latino Health Crisis, Mantonio...all used hispanic dialects. Thick ones that altered the spelling of the words. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess what upsets me about people screaming "RACIST!" at the top of their lungs is the fact that they either A) haven't said a word before because they either didn't give a shit or felt it was perfectly fine or B) are only speaking up now because they think this is something new.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
To the Bullhorn person up top who actually referred to Chris Onstad as a skinhead; what the fuck? That's not fair at all.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's a character, ladies and gentlemen. The character has a thick accent with broken english. I'm willing to bet nobody's sending angry letters to Gede Watanabe from "UHF" over his karate instructor character, or over Long Duk Dong from Sixteen Candles.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, all of you, lighten up. If you really think Chris Onstad is such an awful racist, then go elsewhere. I'm willing to bet, however, that Onstad has been personally hurt by all these hot accusations that are pretty much baseless.

      How is Chevy's accent racist?  I live in the American midwest and get made fun of all the time for my accent--by other Americans--of the same race.  Is that racist?
