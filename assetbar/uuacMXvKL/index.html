      They actually do have a slightly different cut and fit from, say, the fairly typical Hanes Beefy T. They also have a different, but more subtle feel as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Other than that they do actually produce them domestically and apparently treat their employees fairly well. Ignoring all the sexual harassment suits against Dov Charney and his apparent interest in jerking off in front of women and reporters. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't personally care for them and I don't like how their shirts look or fit me personally, but I can see why people would like them aside from merely the trendy aspect.

      You say  <em>"jerking off in front of women and reporters"</em>  like it's a bad thing! <br/>

Seriously though, if we let the hang-ups of the CEOs of certain companies prevent us from buying stuff then no one would by  <em>Hustler</em>  or even  <em>Playboy</em>  ever.

      i knew a Darlene here in town. was a friend's sister. she moved back into town.. and then his place. so he moved out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
she was 10 years or so past being a competitive weight lifter / body builder. took lots of steroids. had a deep rough voice like an alligator. horrible. she was a walking sin. big too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
she decided to shrink by taking meth. she afforded her meth by embezzling money from her brother's rafting company while simultaneously [stealing] selling an immaculate gun collection (Colts) and his dirtbike.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
the name Darlene is a punch line around these parts.

      Darlene's face in that panel reminds me of a woman I met once. She was a 50 year old renting the room in my aunt's house. She was a former weightlifter who had gotten in a motorcycle accident and lost her left leg. She was dangerously thin. I got the impression that she had never been rather large, but that since the accident she had lost almost all her mass, and most of her brain matter. Her left foreleg was a now a carbon fiber/titanium tube that ran from her thigh. She wore new balances and nike long sleeve t-shirts. She survived on social security and spent her days spending time online at the library.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
She came to dinner at my parents house and had the habit of speaking loudly out of turn. Her hair was cut short like mine was in high school, parted in the middle. Her eyes were unnaturally always open and always showed a smile, like a aged, washed up doll that used to take meth and now loved coors light. She acted like a confused eight year old with the outward signs of life expereince: "What do olives taste like," she would ask while drinking her fourth beer, "I don't think i've ever had any." And later she would exclaim "good lord" when my mother produced a cooked ham, "I thought ham was always sliced." Later she was cought stealing from a grocery store and sent to a halfway house. I learned later that she was also attracted to my girlfriend and made it known aloud. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guessed brain damage. My mother guessed redneck. The line was never clear to me. <br/>

      Yeah, I wasn't sure how to read that panel.  Was she stifling a belch? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then I decided that she was getting a little choked up there.  She's hitting on the manager hoping she'll get a left over Big Mac that has been underneath the heat lamp too long.  But Lyle offers to actually pay for a meal, and has brand liquor to share with her rather than a half-empty jug of Gallo.  She thinks this may be her Prince Charming.  She steadies herself with a drink, her words are measured, but the quiver of her lower lip betrays her emotion.

      i'll tell y'all something though... <br/> 
maruchan ramen flavoring is not as good as nissin's. it turns the water thicker. into something your stomach does not understand. your tummy goes 'oh! it's a liquid! this is no problem!' but then it starts to churnin' and your digestive system goes 'now what in the wide world of sports is this jive' and gets angry. <br/>

      naw, not the cup-a-soup versions. the kind you boil in the small saucepan that sometimes you forgot you made something in last night so you get kinda frustrated 'cos you have to wash the half-arsed soup you made last night out before you fill it up to the rivets with water and set it a'boil.

      no, see, when you pour all the noodles into the bowl, none should remain in the pot so all that was in there was some noodles and water, which you don't need to bother cleaning, since the remaining water evaporates! <br/>

      Yeah, I don't really get tacos.  I mean burritos make sense.  Put it in a wrapping of bread so the stuff doesn't fall out.  But tacos are open on 3 sides.  And especially with hard shells, they're prone to breaking the 4th side leaving you with basically a vertical sandwich.

      The foil further adds stability. Not only do you have a wrapping, but you've got an exoskeleton around it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah and when you get most tacos from a taqueria they really pile on the toppings. Then again, they usually give you two tortillas with that sort, but then it's sort of a make-your-own taco kit as you have to shift half of them off. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I never see hard shells any more. I mean, occasionally you'll find a place doing the authentic style where you actually fry them to make them crisp, but never the pre-made style. If I had grown up here I would probably be amazed to visit a Taco Bell and experience a whole new world of tacos that fall apart easily.

      Dammit, I avoided this for so long, but I cannot do so any longer. My favorite local spot for burritos is Taqueria Cancun. They're fairly popular, but they're also pretty damn good. El Tonayense (they run a number of trucks and two storefronts) is also in the top 5. El Castillito is also rather good, but I don't have enough trips under my belt there to say more. I find Taqueria El Buen Sabor to be pretty good as well even if they're not enough to really wow me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would avoid Taqueria San Jose and La Taqueria (no rice in their burritos, but I'm told they have better tacos than burritos and since they have good meat I can see the truth in this, but their burritos aren't worth it) as neither is particularly great. Pancho Villa Taqueria is like a better version of Chipotle and you can do a lot better, but they're tolerable. They have good salsa though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Neither of the places in the Haight are worth going to if you don't live there or absolutely need a burrito. Zona Rosa is better, but only barely and only because El Balazo consistently disappointed me on three different items in a row. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Papalote has its followers, but they don't wrap in foil and they're really not trying to be a traditional taqueria. If what you want is some sort of hipster burrito with marinated tofu or an unfoiled pork verde then maybe you're the type to enjoy them. I'm willing to give them another try. People rave about their salsa, but I didn't find anything to be particularly spectacular about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Little Chihuahua does a nice brunch and from what I've tasted I definitely need to go back and give them some more burrito time. I've heard excellent things about their plantain burrito. They're also trying pretty hard to be all-natural with quality sourcing on their meat and fish, reusable containers for everything and a solid vibe in that manner overall, but while still keeping their prices to be roughly the same as everyone else. If that's your deal you might want to keep them in mind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Honestly you're probably going to get a pretty good burrito from just about anywhere. It's a high-level game though and there are some really excellent places out there at the same prices so if all you're getting is "pretty good", well, maybe you should be trying for better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh and I'm told that some of the best burritos are being made by  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110609025030/https://www.kasaindian.com/">Indians</a> .

      Hmm... I didn't notice that at first, but I went back over it and I see exactly what you mean. My issue is more than, in the particular case of Taqueria Can-Cun, they have won a Best of the Bay Reader's Choice award for something like the past decade consecutively. The problem with that is that when a place wins it isn't always indicative of them being good, but just that people read the awards last year, went to the place, and never really tried much else so it keeps winning. Not that it's bad, but that it isn't really the best. You also see this sort of thing with a lot of awards given out to places just because of the neighborhood they're in, e.g. I doubt the shoe repair place on Haight is necessarily the best, but merely the only damn shoe repair place most readers of an alternative weekly knew in large enough numbers to vote for. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So it's not that something popular can't be good, but that I don't want to incorrectly correlate that something popular must be good.

      The basics are pretty simple though. Six feet with each foot made up of a dactyl which is short, short, long (the name comes from the Greek word for finger as the three segments of a dactyl are compared to the three sections of your fingers). <br/> 
 <br/> 
The last foot is always a spondee (two long syllables), but these can also be used in the first four feet. The fifth is always (well, almost always) a dactyl. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, there's a bit more to it than that, but that's pretty much all you really need to know.

      It is the basics that I understand.  What I don't understand is the specific rules.  Like apparently a vowel followed by two consonant sounds makes it long, and you are supposed to omit "um"s, or something? <br/> 
It is the specifics which mess me up, and make it so that I can't even translate one single line. <br/> 
You're wrong though.  A dactyl is long, short, short.  You're thinking of anapest.  I suppose the Greeks counted their knuckles the other way? <br/> 
The  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110609025030/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactyl_(poetry)">wikipedia page</a>  says that Lucy in the Skies is Dactylic, and that gives me a litle hope for my ability to scna, because I  <em>so noticed that</em> .  Also, Across the Universe (the song this time, ya dicks) is trochee.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I believe that the last foot is two syllables long in dactyl, but the last syllable can be either long or short.  At least in Virgil.   <br/> 
But yeah, I can figure out the rules myself.  But I disagree that this is all I need to know.  But I'm lazy and can look it up easily online.

      It helps to some degree.  For example, let's say that there are two very similar verbs, "polare" with a long "o" and "polare" with a short one, and they both have very different meanings.  If it is at the beginning of a line, you know it is the first polare, since it has to start with a long syllable.  So yeah, it helps some. But I'm bad at scansion, so I don't know.

      Machine Girl had heart. kinda felt like a modern day Azumi. it made me cry. it made me smile. Tokyo Gore Police was flashy and trashy, if you like that sort of thing. you know, where each scene feels like it came out of a music video? kinda like Repo!, but not  <em>that</em>  bad. i just really could have done without all the color-tinted high-contrast lighting and the in-your-face dynamic-panoramic camera angles. it be all IS THIS COOL ENOUGH DAEDALA IS THIS COOL ENOUGH and i'm all,  <em>NO</em> .  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i guess it had some moments, conceptually. and this girl with sewed up tits gave me a pretty huge phantom boner.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
oh yea, tgh, didn't you say you're scared of bjs because you think the girl is gonna bite off your junk? i thought you felt that way BECAUSE you'd seen Tokyo Gore Police. a superior junk-biting film is The Killer Kondom, which, while made by Troma, is actually well acted, coherent, and serious where it should be. unlike that Tromeo and Juliet bullshit. ugh.

      I think the original  <em>Last House on the Left</em>  is generally considered to be the standard when we talk about junk-biting films. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, modern-day  <em>Azumi</em> ? The manga isn't that old (1994) and the film just came out in 2003 (which I really want to see, but Netflix are dicks and have it listed, but not in stock) along with a sequel in 2005. Oh, wait, you mean setting-wise. Then yeah, I guess I could see that.

      I believe it, it's a shame that the headlines only get something like 30 minutes to play though, because Thrice is probably mainly only going to play the fruity art shit from their last two cds and I really want to hear  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Image of the Invisible</span>  or really anything from  <em>Vhessiu</em>  live, and they ALWAYS tour with awesome bands but only seem to make it as far as the House of Blues in Downtown Disney before they just leave Florida forever.

      Vhessiu is so brilliant and yeah the first half off Alchemy is really good because it explores the dichotomy of Thrice really well (balancing the hardcore with the weird electronic-esque shit) but then the last half is just Kensrue's acoustic stuff basically.

      you mean Vheissu wasn't fruity art shit? i mean all that aimless tinkering and clear singing. dear god save me from that awful clear singing. you know another awesome band that too much clear singing ruined? Alexisonfire. goddamn was their self-titled album light years ahead of its time. and is it me or did thrice stop writing catchy riffs in vheissu? all acoustic-y and shit.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
doesn't thrice headline at warped tour like every year? i remember seeing them there, and they played deadbolt. so fucking fun. i wouldn't pay $55, though. as i recall, during their set there were lots of plastic drink bottles on the ground and people were hell of throwing them at each other. still better than the mud flinging that goes on at ozzfest, i guess. i saw them again at a small indoor venue for $12. i am of the opinion that outdoor events are always annoying as fuck. the people suck and the acoustics suck. the only reason to go is to people-watch/get watched.  <br/>

      The acoustics at most indoor venues also really suck. I don't think I've ever been to a single rock venue that had good sound.

      I went to the Warped tour in '98. Even with my relatively shitty taste in music at the time, I came away from it knowing that I would never attend another one for as long as I lived. Life has been pretty good since I made that decision.

      In my experiences venue security almost never stops people from smoking pot, but if they're smoking tobacco they will be on your ass the instant you light up as pursuant with local laws prohibiting smoking in bars and clubs. <br/>

      i must say. when i joined this assetbar. i thought i would feel out of place and not understand most of the jokes you all made. and yet. i have laughed deeply at these comments, which is a relief, as i have now read every achewood enough times, that the website only makes me laugh at new comics/the rare occasion i find a strip i have overlooked/only read once/forgot about.  <br/> 
but as it pertains to this comic, i am personally enthralled to finally find out about lyle. he is a man of mystery. and special-pasta-bowl-man-douches.

I can't wait until assetbar is more popular than  <br/> 
Twitter, which people keep saying it's going to be (this is the beta version, apparently).  And in the future, when there are college courses offered about it, people will ask the professor just what are the origins of this great all pervasive porta-to-the-stars, and the professor will sigh, put his head in his hands and mumble "What news from the north?"

12 oz. is surreal shit but just so surreal I do not understand nor care to understand and basically just spend the entire time yelling at the tv asking it why it isn't playing Sealab 2021 or even a Family Guy rerun, anything to sooth the burning in my frontal lobe.

      Ah man I was even thinking of Squidbillies too. I usually only ever see the one where the weird porcupine dude reads "The Lottery" to them, and Grandmas gets pulled apart by trucks. <br/>

Haven't seen SuperJail, actually, and probably won't because I'm saving my Adult Swim viewing for when Venture Bros comes back. I'm gonna end up having to watch all of Tim and Eric off torrents like I did last season though. Maybe if they released the DVD sets in timely fashion I WOULDN'T HAVE TO. HINT HINT.

      I like to think this is an effect of Lyle's faulty memory - his type of diet would do that. See how her left shoulder seems to be shrugging him off already, all stills of her, even from back when she happened unto him, marred by the pain of the breakup.

      This strip is sorta like a Tom Waits song.  Hell for that matter, a lot of Achewood strips take after that Tom Waits style of romanticizing the burlesque underbelly of American life, often with that nostalgic imagery of the past, and especially with that clever surrealism and abstraction and rhythm and rhyme in not only the arrangement of the words but also in the arrangement of the concepts formed by the words. <br/> 
 <em><br/>
Well the smart money's on Harlow<br/>
And the moon is in the street<br/>
The shadow boys are breaking all the laws<br/>
And you're ease of East St. Louis<br/>
and the wind is making speeches<br/>
And the rain sounds like a round of applause<br/>
<br/>
Napoleon is weeping<br/>
In the Carnival Saloon<br/>
His invisible fiance's in the mirror<br/>
And the band is going home<br/>
It's raining hammers, it's raining nails<br/>
It's true there's nothing left for him down here<br/>
</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
This style is more than just a catchy sound or gimmic... it's multi-layered, it's dynamic, it's alive and complex.  There has been talk now and again of Onstad hitting his peak, of him having left his best material behind him.  Well haven't we all.  I don't know anything first hand about music making or comic strip making, but it certainly seems like Onstad's style, like Tom Wait's style, has a lot of potential.  For those of you who haven't met Mr. Waits, I'd like to post a bit of his rambling, and I hope it's not off topic, nor a distraction nor disrespectful to Onstad to compare him to someone he's obviously not a clone of, regardless of who that might be.  I'm just pointing out a similarity which I perceive.  No doubt those more literate and insightful than myself could compare/contrast the two's styles much better than I could.  It's been a while since English 101, for me. <br/>

 <br/> 
(should this be bold?  What the hell...) <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong><br/>
When I was small I always thought that songwriters sat alone at upright pianos in cramped smoky little rooms with a bottle and an ashtray and everything came in the window blew through them and came out of the piano as a song... and in a weird way that is exactly what happens.<br/>
<br/>
What's Orphans? I don't know. Orphans is a dead end kid driving a coffin with big tires across the Ohio River wearing welding goggles and a wife beater with a lit firecracker in his ear.<br/>
<br/>
At the center of this record is my voice. I try my best to chug, stomp, weep, whisper, moan, wheeze, scat, blurt, rage, whine, and seduce. With my voice, I can sound like a girl, the boogieman, a Theremin, a cherry bomb, a clown, a doctor, a murderer - I can be tribal. Ironic. Or disturbed. My voice is really my instrument.<br/>
<br/>
Kathleen and I wanted the record to be like emptying our pockets on the table after an evening of gambling, burglary, and cow tipping. We enjoy strange couplings, that's how we got together. We wanted Orphans to be like a shortwave radio show where the past is sequenced with the future, consisting of things you find on the ground, in this world and no world, or maybe the next world. Whatever you imagine that to be.<br/>
<br/>
If a record really works at all, it should be made like a homemade doll with tinsel for hair and seashells for ears stuffed with candy and money. Or like a good woman's purse with a Swiss army knife and a snake bite kit.<br/>
<br/>
Orphans contains songs for all occasions. Some of the songs were written in turmoil and recorded at night in a moving car, others were written in hotel rooms and recorded in Hollywood during big conflamas. That's when conflict weds drama. At any rate these are the ones that survived the flood and were rescued from the branches of trees after the water's retreat.<br/>
<br/>
Gathering all this material together was like rounding up chickens at the beach. It's not like you go into vault and check out what you need. Most of it was lost or buried under the house. Some of the tapes I had to pay ransom for to a plumber in Russia. You fall into the vat. We started to write just to climb out of the vat. Then you start listening and sorting and start writing in response to what you hear. And more recording. And then you get bit by a spider, go down the gopher hole, and make a whole different record. That was the process pretty much the last three years.<br/>
<br/>
Then we met Karl Derfler, a wizard engineer who works at Bay Side Studios in Richmond, CA, in the science fiction part of town. A battlefield medic, he did a Lazarus on a number of the songs and recorded all the new material.<br/>
<br/>
On Orphans there is a mambo about a convict who breaks out of jail with a fishbone, a gospel train song about Charlie Whitman and John Wilkes Boothe, a delta blues about a disturbing neighbor, a spoken word piece about a woman who was struck by lightening, an 18th century Scottish madrigal about murderous sibling rivalry, an American backwoods a cappella about a hanging. Even a song by Jack Kerouac and a spiritual with my own personal petition to the Lord with prayer.. There's even a show tune about an old altar boy and a rockabilly song about a young man who's begging to be lied to.<br/>
<br/>
I think you will find more singing and dancing here than usual. But I hope fans of more growling, more warbling, more barking, more screeching won't be disappointed either.<br/>

      Did he? I originally said something about that, but I checked and in the preview box it looked like they had been shafted as well so I didn't want to make a deal of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wish he'd stop doing these double strips though. If he just split them up he'd have a buffer ready to go next time. I wonder how much time he spends trying to finish up extra material to make up for being late with the original. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think we've all learned to have patience, but if you do not give a dude a hard time who would we be? Is way of dudes being friendly, yes? All with the alpha dog nature and such. Until someone takes it to a far distance and manatee is endink up dead.

      Exactly. I know it's been said a billion times in a billion different ways but I wish he would just NOT give himself deadlines. I mean, I never read the news part of Achewood so I only know there is an update when there is an update on the RSS Feed, but I'm tired of everyone bitching and then I check and then  <em>I</em>  get pissed and it just escalates.

      McDonald's is pretty much on the bottom of fast food places that I might patronize. The oh-so-trendy In-n-Out Burger goes pretty high on the list with Carl's Jr. (though I grew up with Hardees) and Burger King coming in next. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Really, unless I have to consider something like Checkers or Red Barn McDonald's is going to go to the bottom. Below even Wendy's which can have a certain charm at times. Typically times when I want a slab of grease that has been forcibly congealed into a hamburger-like shape.

If we had In-n-Out's or Whattaburger's here in my neck of the woods I'd be so fucking fat. The only hip trendy hamburger place here is Steak-N-Shake, which might as well just be called Shake because their steakburgers are more like shitburgers.

Since when have they been hip or trendy though? I just knew they were awesome and were 24 hours. I wish there were more 24 hour places around. They are one of the very, very few things I miss about Kansas. The other being Yello Sub (aka Planet Sub outside of Lawrence). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, and they have great chili.

      I transferred to a job in downtown St. Louis about a month ago. I soon after discovered Planet Sub and have eaten there no fewer than ten times in that span. <br/>

      Planet Sub, cheddar instead of swiss, no tomatoes. <br/>

It is among the best things you can ever hope to put in your mouth. They need to go national. They'd put a serious dent in Quzinos and hopefully kill those Subway asshats. <br/>

I own a shirt.  <em>I own a shirt for damn toasted sub restaurant.</em>  If you'd eaten there you would understand.

      Maybe it's just with the circle I run with (the Publix baggers crew) but they always go there. I just like the shakes though, I am a Shake Man.

      I just realized looking at the sign that Jumbo Hole is "HJ", backwards. Now whether this is a reference to handjobs or Howard Johnson's (the roof does look kinda similar) I can't be certain, but I'm sure it's at least one, if not both.
