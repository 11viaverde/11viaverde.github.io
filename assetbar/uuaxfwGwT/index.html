      Your post gives me the thinnest pretext to relate the following anecdote.  Richard Harris was on with David Letterman once, and they had roughly the following exchange: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Richard Harris: I had the best times of my life when drinking.  I loved every second of it, and don't regret anything about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Letterman: So why did you stop? <br/> 
 <br/> 
RH: [very matter-of-factly]  Oh, because I wanted to live. <br/> 
 <br/> 
- <br/> 
 <br/> 
BTW, if you ever see him on a talk show rerun, let it roll, as he always reeled-off* 12 minutes of great stories. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*almost wrote "came with", but decided I couldn't risk initiating the ensuing enendre-fest.

i turned 21 today (well, the 30th.) <br/>

      My first legal purchase on the night of my 21st was a bottle of Jim Beam with I finished without sharing. I'd already been drinking illegally long before that, but it was still excessive. I would in no way suggest that you follow that lead. It was sort of a questionable idea and it had tragic results for my insides. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I were to go back and do it again, I would buy a middle-of-the-line bottle of vodka, some Kahlua and half a pint of cream. The White Russian is much more than just a cult fad drink; it's maybe the most perfect cocktail ever cocktailed.

      It's probably too late, but I'd recommend a bottle of Prosecco, a white Italian wine that is slightly sparkling and pretty cheap, while also being good.  Much better than any champagne I've ever tried, which tend to be astringent and dry.

      It was OK, but I've found it took a lot longer to grow on me than  <em>Mink Car</em> , even though I too complained a bit about having heard almost everything off that album beforehand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>The Else</em> ... well, that's taking even longer to grow on me. Some good songs, but I'm still thinking it's Their worst album.  <em>Venue Songs</em>  and some of the stuff on  <em>Cast Your Pod to the Wind</em>  was better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Thunderbird", "Damn Good Times"... some good songs were on The Spine, but it was a tough go at first. "With the Dark", however, was just plain awesome.

      After listening to it again I think it has the same problem as  <em>Factory Showroom</em>  in that it has some really good songs on it and a number of really weak songs or just mediocre songs that bring it all down. It's also, well, it doesn't really entirely sound like Their usual output in many places. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I did note that it has some great basslines on a lot of songs. "The Shadow Government" is rather rollicking and drives the song well. "Withered Hope" brings some almost unexpected slap bass. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ultimately it seems to be the Dust Brothers produced tracks that are the weakest and tend not to sound much like TMBG and more like, well, a bit more like the Dust Brothers produced them. I mean, "Withered Hope" really bears the marks of their production. The TMBG produced tracks tend to be much better. When they all worked together I think the blend of styles shows through a bit more and you get a nice, gentler influence that brings out the best of both. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It also really doesn't help that the album has many of the weaker tracks earlier on. Not that they should front-load the hell out of it, but I'm not entirely sold on the track ordering. Ending with  <br/> 
"The Mesopotamians" though was, well, how could you do anything else?

      I'm a huge fan of their early stuff, but I haven't heard a new TMBG album since  <em>Factory Showroom.</em>  It seemed like they were nearing the end of their run. Was I wrong?

      Yeah.  <em>Factory Showroom</em>  is largely regarded as their worst album. They certainly slowed down there for a while and the next release was the live  <em>Severe Tire Damage</em> , but  <em>Mink Car</em>  was rather good and the next full release. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I recall it came out on 9/11/01 along with Ben Folds' first solo album  <em>Rockin' The Suburbs</em>  (and while that was a great album and a revitalized sound after Ben Folds Five had been meandering with  <em>Rheinhold Messner</em>  it was also his last decent album before he basically just moved into adult contemporary garbage).

      Weird. I thought they  clearly declined from the first album. A lot more weepy ballads and by  <em>Messner</em>  they had added so much extra instrumentation much of the time that it was turgid and overproduced much of the time. I mean, the horns absolutely  <strong>made</strong>  "Army", but much of the rest of it just wasn't that good in my opinion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Interestingly I saw them on tour for that album and it was much better live once the production was stripped away.

      Belgand, everything you disliked about  <em>Messner</em>  is what made it my favorite, although I would be interested in hearing the stripped-down live version as well. Loved the self-titled debut, too. Other than that I'm not much into him. I mean, not even the stuff of his that I love is something that I'd ever put on around other people. He's a little embarrassing. But I can dig those two by myself sometimes.

Even if the comment you are laming are actually lame, I still have to read them to understand the following comments that you chubby. 69 chubbies and 4 lames = hidden.  Cool.

      Some people do not believe that Jesus was the son of God, or even a real life person. These people may consider it hypocritical to spread goodwill in his name, but may also want to spread goodwill at the same time as the 60% or whatever of the Earth's population who do believe in Jesus. <br/>

      Can you explain that last sentence (not the douche part) because the sytax seemed weird to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While I understand that there are plenty of atheist and agnostics out there who do good things for the world, and plenty of religious folks who just fuck the planet up, usually it's the religious people spreading goodwill and the non-religious people Bah, Humbugging it up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And Christmas has become BARELY about the birth of Christ so can we just still call it Christmas and not whatever ironic name we can think of to make us sound cynical and cool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or if we do have to give it an ironic name can we call it Giftmyass?

      I stopped believing in the Christmas story about 30 years ago.  But I still find myself saying "Merry Christmas." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jesus was a pretty awesome dude.  He didn't create any art, he didn't invent anything, he didn't originate any theories, and he didn't kill anyone, yet we still remember him thousands of years later. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Offhand, I can't think of anyone else with those credentials. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't have to believe any supernatural stories to think of Jesus as a pretty cool guy.  The way I put it is,  <em>I believe in, and venerate Jesus, but I don't believe in Christ.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the world would be a much better place if everybody acted a little more like Jesus.  That's actually one of the reasons I don't really like Christ.  If Jesus is Christ, he is supernatural, and I can be excused for not emulating his behavior.  But if he is just a man, I can believe that I have a chance to follow his example. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But anyway, after saying "Merry Christmas" for over 40 years, I still say it today.  And it doesn't bother me to say it, even though I don't believe the underlying story. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This may make me a hypocrite, but if so, that's OK with me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I also don't mind the calling it Giftmas.  It is an apt description. <br/>

      If you're going for original ideas it's hard to say who really thought of anything.  Jesus or Buddha, preaching generally good things but did they think them up?  Difficult to say.  Buddha's about 500 years older though.

      What? I'm not faulting anyone for believing in Jesus, nor was I making any sweeping statements about religious people. I'm just saying that, while it might not coincide with your opinion on the subject, some people might feel bad about referring to "Christmas" when they actually have no interest in possibly-real first century thinkers and just want to give presents or celebrate the evergreens or whatnot.

      I'm almost like, 100 percent certain you are wrong on that last part. The Quran is the main Muslim holy book and they have no other. <br/> 
 <br/> 
See, Judaism and Muslim(inity?) diverges do to Abraham trying to father a child with his Arab housekeeper due to him not having faith that YHWH would allow his own wife to have children. He shunned the housekeeper and his son, who ended up being the main ancestor of the Muslims, so I would imagine that his descendants would shun anything representing Abraham. <br/>

      You're confusing the origin story of the Arab Semitic people with the Islamic or Muslim teaching, which was transmitted through the Arab prophet Mohammed. <br/>

      You fool, I have read Al-Qur'an (got my copy right here, the Ahmed Ali translation), and Mohammed goes on and on about Abraham, Mose, and Jesus, and how everyone seems to have ignored their message, so now the Arabs are getting a version.

SJE was implying (from what I thought) that Muslims used both the Old and New Testaments of the Judeo-Christian Bible AND the Quran as their holy books, and I was correcting him on THAT, NOT whatever the fuck you guys are talking about. <br/>

      First post should not be something that people race for.  <br/>

...For haste can lead to typos. <br/>

I like pogo's suggestion, personally; if Michael was a stereo and Tequiza addict at, like, age 10 then presumably Beef would've been living with Gramma K long before he was.

      I hate to say it and it's totally out-of-character for me, but sometimes you have to realize that it could always be worse. <br/>

I think a part of Beef, the part that knows enough to be able to lament his terrible Christmas Eve sees in this encounter that it could be that much worse for him. <br/>

      No, man... just, no. Do you really want to hear a lecture on automotive history and the drastically negative effects of government regulations? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let me just put it this way:  <br/> 
I've owned a 1967 Chrysler Newport, and a 1976 Buick LeSabre, both cars being good representatives of the medium-priced full sized sedans of their period, both very close in size. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The '67 had superior build quality and durability of the interior, exterior, and mechanical componaents. It weighed less by a couple hundred pounds, was far more powerful, and averaged around 15 mpg compared to the '76's 10 or so mpg. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Similarly, government over-regulation and excessive safety standards are the reason why modern economy cars, including "green" novelties such as the Prius get worse mileage than what some imports achieved in the early 70's. Ditto why the latest generations of Camaro/Mustang/Challenger are all pushing 4000 lbs.

      What do you mean? Imports break just as fantastically as any other car. I used to think they were much better cars until I started working at the auto centre and found that they knock, leak and burn oil, interiors made of paper and melted down transformers action figures. Car trouble usually happens because of the operator and not the car. Most people dont even lift their hood once a week and shout "HOW ARE THINGS GOING IN THERE" let alone perform scheduled maintenence...AGGRH it makes me angry. <br/>

Corliss' car just needs a new cap & rotor, and a set of plugs. 30 bucks back in '81. It'll probly run just fine after that but she is from circumstances.

Part of the joke being that those detroit honkers had 8 cylinders, so they actually could limp by ugly on 6, whereas that ain't happenin' with a 4-banger.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, gazdatronik, Corliss' car may get some healing from plugs, cap & rotor, but more likely it's burnt valves, so she's screwed until she works out a deal with someone like Lyle to redo the heads on it. And the cylinders are probably needing rings also, so just redoing the heads is a big waste.

      Okay, Gaz, you are absolutely correct.  <em>Missing</em>  can imply several different causes,  <em>misfiring</em>  implies fire not being present. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 I also have a Taurus story you may enjoy. It's what we call a shaggy-dog story. We have a '95 little red wagon with 3.8 6-banger that looks like it rolled off the showroom floor. We got it 1 1/2 years ago with < 50k miles. Immaculate. Maybe 1 little scratch in the finish. Interior still smelled new.  It had sat in garages most of those 12 years. Why? <br/> 
 <br/> 
You know the story with the '95's and shitty headgaskets? Ford was doing recalls and cashback because those crap gaskets would fail around 50k. Back to that later. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The reason it was basically unused was the first owner, a woman, developed cancer shortly after purchasing it. After a few years, she died. It sat in garage a few more years, then her husband sold it to a friend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Next owner, a woman, also developed cancer. It sat garaged, she died. This was in Dallas.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Her widower sold it to a friend, who sold it to a retired Federal Penitentiary warden, who we later bought it from. This was a nice old guy, but a hard guy too. You can imagine.  <br/> 
 He felt obligated to tell us the car's history before signing it over. This guy was living in my hometown less than a mile from where I grew up 40 years ago. Okay, we know it may be cursed. My wife writes out a check, but forgets to sign it. He doesn't notice it either.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
My wife wanted to drive it so she could haul stuff around. He calls next day. Oh, sorry. We can get you cash. No, he just wants to get the correct check, he doesn't like driving around with that much cash. He's driving through to OKC, so we meet and fix this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 After 6 months, the tranny case cracked one morning. Out of the blue. Nothing wrong mechanically. You know what that runs, it's like a full rebuild. Everything, planetary gears has to be swapped into a new case. Okay.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
A month later, it starts overheating on her. It had never had the cooling system flushed ever, so I did a thorough flush. Pure rust water, as you can imagine. Cancer of the cooling system. <br/> 
 Of course, that rust was what was serving in place of the rotted headgasket, which soon failed right on schedule after I had totally flushed it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Wife is ready at this point to just ditch this car. My mechanic agrees. He saw many of this model with the headgasket issue, but of course, years earlier. Online, there is plenty of corroborating evidence. <br/> 
I call Ford Service and tell them I have this car they had issued recalls and rebates for exactly this issue, here's the VIN, blah-blah. They say, well, it is past the date, and I explain that is because it sat in a garage while its previous owners were dying of cancer, I'm sorry FORD for that slight inconvenience of timing. <br/> 
 They of course, won't budge.  <br/> 
I tell the guy I am cursing his company,  <strong>screw you Ford, FUCK YOU. May you FAIL!</strong>  I have had maybe 6 Ford trucks and vans that had lots of heart. That's probably the last. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I tell my mechanic, okay, let's fix it anyway. It never seriously overheated, let's get the heads resurfaced, get a good gasket kit. This bad gasket is a known issue. This guy is like my brother, he is so conscientious.  <br/> 
Okay, he'll do it. He is so much more worried than me that he's taking my $, putting his work and part into a doomed vehicle, and I'm going to drive out the door and the car will overheat and die. Because that exact thing happened to him a month earlier with another person with a Ford. Maybe a Festiva. It was sitting in his back lot when I drove the Taurus up, all blowing huge clouds of steam out the exhaust.So he fixes it, goes through everything he can think of related.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
A few months later, my wife is driving to work, by way of a rural route, and hears a thump on the side. Last time she heard a thump, it was the transmission case torquing a crack in itself. There are 2 deep little dents on rear passenger door, an inch apart like 00 shotgun pellets. No one in sight. Nothing.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is the car we took to Dallas for Thanksgiving at my sister's last month. Halfway there, around the town where I grew up, and where we'd bought it off the guy,  it starts overheating. <br/> 
 I pop the hood and there's antifreeze all over the manifold. Crap.  <br/> 
Limp it in to a station to top it off with water and antifreeze, and I see a topside heater-hose spewing with a pinhole leak. This is road-fixable with a hose-clamp and some rubbery gasket material. All you need is a common screwdriver or a 5/16" socket for the clamp nut. On down the road we go, no problem. I later replace the hose. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I'm still smelling that faint, horrid antifreeze smell, and I suspect another hose is developing a leak. <br/> 
 The motor is tight as a drum, however.

      Yeah those 3.8's are hellish. His is a 3.0, fortunately. In fact I will be buying it soon for 250 dollars. I'm going to chop the back and make it into an el camino type vehicle. When it rolls over 300,000 miles I might get it a new radio.

      The 3.8 is a stout motor, it was just those few years they put a cheesy headgasket in it. Zippy, good mileage.  <br/> 
 That's a lot of work to chop the roof, put in a window? put a bed in the trunk? <br/> 
 Surely there's a few El Caminos or Rancheros out there somewhere.  <br/> 
 If I were you, I'd be looking for a salvage motor instead of pouring 2 qts of oil a day on the highway. Just my 2 cents.

      There was a couple in Naples that took to only whispering to one another. They withdrew together and stayed indoors, avoiding the company of others. Soon they began not to speak at all. They took solely to their room, and there developed a system of signs to converse with by their hands. Eventually their sign language became more and more abbreviated, until, lying together, they had developed such a close attention to themselves and each other that they came to speak only by their heartbeats. <br/> 
 <br/> 
	After many long years their hearts ceased to beat, and they spoke to one another solely in spirit. But it is said that if one enters the room in which they are still entombed and holds one%u2019s own heart close to theirs, their blood begins to run again, and with the faintest of oscillations their hearts beat once more, permitting one to eavesdrop but never understand, as if listening in on distant crickets whispering in the walls of the highest hermitage. They repeat the same single rhythm until one draws away; no one has yet divined its meaning. <br/>

      Outdated sensationalism. The Majestic Council of Radical Machinists discovered in 1853 that those heartbeats were just a redundancy broadcast for the local Number Station. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I must admit an unfair disappointment that, even after the information from that year's periodical was leaked in 1854, that the popular consciousness decided to remember the investigation of von Kempelen's Turkish Chessplaying Automation over more groundbreaking inquiries. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As you've so uncouthly demonstrated, though, nothing more can be expected from the unstudied public.

      Hear hear! I am not so unstudied as eikre would have me appear--though I fear that the sheer weight of his sneer will drive the unassuming masses to clear from my response here, for which I would shed not just a single tear. My further research has shown--and you would know this if you had read this year's Machinista, where it was published--that the Lovers of Naples appear to have generated a resonance field through a specialized type of ectotonic spread and have utilized it to broadcast their rhythm from the local Number Station in addition to their own hearts. The assumption that the Number Station is the origin of the single, and the lovers a redundancy, is understandable, given the overwhelmingly greater presence the government has over two resting lovers in a hovel, but false. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On a lighter note, Wozzeck, I completely agree with you about being hanged--at least then I'd know where I was, indeed!

      How did you know about the number stations? Have you ever heard those on shortwave? It is excellent. I picked up a broadcast from vietnam on a shortwave radio unit from a B-17 bomber that I was repairing, and a russian numbers station was blasting out their transmission at 50 megawatts making the greatest sounding interference I have ever heard.

      Women  <em>don't</em>  want to date that guy.  It is a fantasy that doesn't remotely translate to reality. <br/>

      I think this depends largely on who you interpret what was said up there. Worships as in  <em>would fight eleven men with knives to defend her honor</em> , or  <em>would grovel at her feet and depend on her to make all decisions</em> , and then there's even  <em>would spread rumors that she has herpes to keep other men away from her</em> . <br/>

      I went back and reread them a couple of times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am still terrible at it I guess, because if you weren't discussing different definitions of "worship," I have no idea what you are talking about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I saw one definition that probably is a good thing, one definition that is pretty clearly a bad thing, and one definition that is really talking about greed and covetousness, not worship. <br/>

But I am open to an explanation of what I am missing.

      uh wozzeck i don't think any of your definitions of "worship" were what i interpreted mr. ivana to be doing. a friend explained to me the other day that there are guys who will take care of you with regard to big things (protect you if eleven guys are attacking you) and guys who will take care of you with regard to small things (getting you things, making you feel comfortable, being sexually attentive). i think i've only really had experience with the first type of guy, and i would not call that worship. perhaps he values me and is thus willing to protect me in extreme circumstances, but in the day-to-day gestures he falls short.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
biff may be onto something though. i mean, i'm sure it's no accident that i end up with these types. perhaps lack of attentiveness is just a by-product of being with a guy who's superior to you in some way, and of course this superiority is why you like him in the first place.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
but it'd be nice to get a little "small scale" attention from someone you already admire, is all i'm saying.

 I would very much fall into the first category I mentioned. I also do the small things, more so with my ex than ever another, because I damn well know that  <em>the small things are important</em> . If she coughed at night, I would be in the kitchen getting her a glass of water before she had a chance to ask. If she fell asleep curled around my arm, cutting off its circulation, oh well. She worked her ass off, and I wasn't going to disturb her sleep for the sake of my own comfort. Often when we were going out or coming home, I would pull her onto my lap and put her shoes on or take them off for her, giving the top of each feet a quick kiss as I did so, simply because I damn well felt like showing a little affection, and to assure her that I found her, all of her, beautiful. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To me the idea that you would give your  <em>life</em>  for someone, or take another's to defend them, but lack the willingness or consideration to attend to the small things is just asinine. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 That having been said, the above is not at all what I intended when I mentioned those who, " <em>would grovel at her feet and depend on her to make all decisions</em> ". That sort is a whole other tirade, and you should be warned now, if you haven't already learned, that they are also often the sort that turn into the third example the moment their object of affection is denied them.

      daaammnn, wozzeck you are like some old school Cornelius-style gentleman! glass of water  <em>fine</em>  but if a dude took my shoes off for me and kissed my feet i think i'd be like dang man shucks you don't gotta do all that now i gotta give you extra oral or buy you a watch or something. i'm pretty sure i'd be pleased if it happened though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i had a roommate who would insist on taking my shoes off for me and rubbing my feet. she would text me while i was in class to ask when i'd be home, then have a fully cooked meal waiting for me, timed so it wouldn't get cold. we were good friends for a couple years before she admitted she had a crush on me. i'm pretty sure lots of women turn gay cuz girls are just more thoughtful usually.

      I am not so obsessed with receiving oral as the typical male. I prefer to do most of the work during Relations Time, and no matter how good the oral, it makes me feel like I'm spending the party leaning against a wall in the kitchen. Like I am treating sex as a boring party. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Now a girl who will walk on and/or rub my back at the drop of a hat is another matter. My spinal cord has met Misfortune more than once and this has given me a great appreciation of such displays of affection. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 I would have suggested that you gay marry your roommate. To spare yourself family shaming you could have told your parents you were just co-concubines. I guess if you don't want to have sex with another lady, though, the relationship would have been rather more farcical than usual.

      Oral is nice, but it's like an appetizer, not a whole meal. I mean, yeah, sometimes a snack is nice or maybe you just sit around and eat nothing but nachos all day, but you feel a bit empty like you missed eating a proper meal.

That's a laugh.  I guess you never took a psychology course or studied human behavior.  We're amazingly alike inside.  We all need love, feel empathy, etc.  You probably just haven't realized the damage porn has done, like the guy in a band who will go deaf at 40.

      Check out Etymotics. They make some very nice earplugs that don't interfere with the sound itself (well, not too much). They offer a basic model for like $10-15 and a much pricier custom-fit model for more. I've been very happy with mine. I no longer leave concerts with my ears ringing until morning. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now to just get shows where people actually have fucking decent sound mixing and don't feel the need to turn  <em>everything</em>  up so loud that I get better sound standing outside. Seriously, I understand the joys of loud music, but some places just take it overboard. It does not need to be that loud and by making it that loud you end up with a lot of booming, muddy sound, and the inability to hear or discern the vocals.

      Meh, they're overpriced usually. I mean, I know of where one is, but chains and fast food places are rather rare in the city. Except McDonald's. You can generally find those fairly often. Far more often than any other fast food place. I guess they've owned the spaces for a long time or something. <br/>

I took some liberties with the lyrics, since if I only did Nice Pete's part the song would be 2 seconds long.

      i will never fucking get sick of this song. anyone who listens to this song in my presence and gets totally into is basically half way there to getting into my pants. sje, if you're reading this, maybe you should get into metal. girls will be all over you after that. it is the BEST. APHRODISIAC. EVER. power metal especially i think arouses this kind of battlefield camaraderie where you're thinking this man is my brother in arms he understands glory and honor and will always protect me from the forces of evil, so it is ok if he does seriously nasty things to me, or something.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i think i remember belgand saying at some point that he can't take screamy vocals? yo belgand, check out these lyrics.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Our king he cannot lead, our king is growing old <br/> 
With a courageous cry, a young man rises form the fold <br/> 
 <br/> 
Astonished faces look his way, as the hopeful carry horror in their hearts <br/> 
Uncertain of a power that malice forged in steel <br/> 
I must face this threat that challenges our lives <br/> 
I'll strike out with vengeance, I'll reap from their demise <br/> 
No! You must not seek the blades, it's said that they are cursed <br/> 
They'll possess you if they're found, to the dreadlord they are bound <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the fourteenth morning's chill, from the rampart he is spotted on the hill <br/> 
With a look of burning poison that fills his eyes with rage <br/> 
I have returned to put an end to all your lives <br/> 
With no remorse I will reap from your demise <br/> 
 <br/> 
basically i will not rest until every dude on assetbar concedes that 3 inches of blood is the shit.

      That was real semen too. The actor playing Ichi didn't have enough so some of the other members of the crew had to help him out. At least, according to the commentary. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It might be worth watching, but it can be a bit of a tough call because it's the sort of thing you have to be into. Sort of like how it's hard to recommend Lynch or Cronenberg without knowing the person better.

      i just listened to that and for the first 2 or 3 minutes i was like "whoa this would be pretty hot" but then i got kinda bored after that.  <br/>

i always wanted to have a "long, slow fuck" (quotes, because i'm not really sure what this means or how it is acheived) to Tinderstick's Another Night In. Raindrops or Jism would probably work too. Stuart Staples is a god. i'm pretty sure if i saw the orchestra live i would actually cry.

      I am not pro tattoo, but I am definitely pro boning that girl. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you had to ask me to state a preference it's definitely going to be against it, but I'm not close-minded about this. I can admit when they look hot and it's not really a deal-breaker sort of thing for me. More of a not being into it and being sort of generally against it kind of thing. Like how I'm also totally against all forms of body piercing (that is, including ears... it's still just sick and weird like an untended-to industrial accident), but I'm not going to make a big deal out of it. I bought my girlfriend earrings a few years ago. At the same time I do find it hot that a friend of mine, last I knew, had never pierced hers. <br/>

Oh and how are 3 Inches of Blood metalcore? I mean, I just heard about them a few minutes ago here, but they seem more solidly power metal to me.

      The feeling I get 90% of the time while listening to Opeth is that this is brilliant and I should find some way to enjoy it, and then I feel of low mind when I don't. Then the pretty singing passage or melodic interlude comes on and I just know the fact that I only enjoy that part means I suck somehow.

      nah, BTBAM have songs that are enjoyable in their entirety, like All Bodies. and what about Selkies? didn't you like 90% of that? i mean if that soft singing and acoustic part didn't start at the middle of the song after the death vocals and blasts, i don't think i would've liked it as much. then it just would've been emo. then you could just go listen to further seems forever or something.

      I have heard very little of BTBAM, but I have also found a lot to hate. I mean, before the vocals started on "Prequel to the Sequel" I was totally with it, but after... I don't think I could shut it off quickly enough.

      It is my God-given duty (God gave me this duty  <em>personally</em>  to enter any and all music conversations and mention the Melvins. As such, I just wanna say that all bands mentioned so far seem so theatrical and absorbed in pretty obvious imagery. I dont know why but the whole "elves/swords/crimson/dragons" thing has always bothered me. I prefer my more metal-ish sounds to be straightup heavy and tense, and hence i want to share  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100420005340/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U8fRHemfZw">this song</a>  with you all. If there's one band that can play the hell out of a basic riff for eight minutes, it's the Melvins. <br/>

Thank you for your time, and I can only hope God lifts this wonderful, horrible affliction.

      That's hardly metal. Just because Pitchfork calls sludgy post-rock metal does not make it so. If you cannot sometimes appreciate theatricality or swords and dragons (unfathomable!)... well, that sounds like a personal problem.

      Oh I'm not saying that the Melvins are metal, I'm just saying that when it comes to bands that take heavy influence from Kiss and tune down to A and have a drummer that people cheer for the Melvins are in my top two. And sure I can appreciate Iron Maiden, Slayer and early Metallica, But bands that formed 20 years after those bands' heydays, and just play faster? I could never get into it. <br/>

      That's not screamy. When I say screamy I'm talking about the effect-ridden Black Metal sort of vocals where some dude just sort of growls into the mic. More Metalocalypse (which is, however, awesome) really. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is just hmm... can I still call it "bitchin'" or has that been co-opted entirely as ironic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I assure you that I was totally rocking out to this. All long hair head-banging along. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Power metal is awesome. Have I ever related my idea for a power metal band called "Eternia"? At first it just sounded like an appropriate name until a friend immediately stated the He-Man connection (must be subconscious, I was a huge He-Man fan when I was a child) and then, c'mon, what could be better than He-Man themed and costumed power metal? All Skeletor bringing the vocals and rhythm guitar, He-Man on lead guitar, Evil Lynn rocking bass, and Orko on drums (Orko  <em>must</em>  be on drums!). Truly a thing of beauty. This must be made to happen.

      You (and I'm guessing your mom) have made an assumption.  It isn't a race.  One step behind?  One step behind who?  Everyone's life is different, measuring your life based on another's achievements is pointless.  That might seem hollow at the moment, but it actually makes life much more pleasant than trying to race others until you die.  What's the point?  I'm not saying give up on life...but why treat it like its a race against others?  There are better ways to approach things like careers and family.

      I had to buy two suits this year as well, and that threw me into a depression. I just got the cheapest ones that still looked vaguely suit-ish.  Becoming the type of person who wears suits is not much fun, I have decided.

      That is also just a plain awesome song. <br/>

It's a lot closer to what I imagine, but I was thinking there was a bit more growly scream (perhaps elements of Mustaine, but not quite Lemmy) in his voice and not quite so high. He is not singing so much as he is  <strong>SHOUTING</strong>  these lyrics. I'm definitely with you and Dae as seeing a Halford-esque delivery, just not the vocal tone.

Actually I meant they should investigate that street in Okmulgee. Apparently it only runs for a block, and from the picture it looks like there's only one house on it. Not to mention that it's a weird place for Google to have a street view of. I'm just saying that it all seems mighty suspicious.

A small anecdote from Okmulgee: <br/> 
 <br/> 
The school was about one third White, one third Black, and one third Native American.  The town is the capital of the Muscogee nation.  About 90% are lower-middle class, or poorer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was the last Friday of school for the year, with classes only on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, with the last two days being finals.  At lunch, a Black girl and an Indian girl got in a fight.  Over the weekend tensions mounted in the town, and on Monday gangs of Indians roamed the halls at school looking for Black kids to jump, until about 15% of the student body got sent home.  I had a significant number of my students miss their finals because the were involved in the racial violence.  I was instructed by the principal to give them all Fs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I heard from one of my fellow teachers that he had been standing in line at the movie theater, and he overheard some Indian parents discussing how their children were obligated to participate in the race war, in order that they uphold their racial honor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
About one in 20 of the female students was a mother by the time she reached graduation age. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fuck Okmulgee.

      Yes, it is a scene from Say Anything where John Cusack goes to a girl's house after she has dumped him because of a variety of issues (she will be leaving to go to college in England at the end of the summer, her father disapproves and is being investigated by the IRS, etc.) he goes to her house at plays the Phil Collins song "In the Air Tonight" on a boombox held above his head. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is an iconic scene that has been heavily referenced in a variety of places and is well-known among those of us who have strong feelings for the 1980s as it was a time of our childhood or teenage years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wasn't even aware it was a Thing on Assetbar until TGH responded to my mentioning it with an image much like this one. I presume it is more common on Assetbar because of the Roast Beef/Molly referencing of the scene in the strip.

      FUCK!! I knew it was a Peter Gabriel song, but somehow I was confused into thinking it was "In the Air Tonight". In my defense both songs start off with "In", they were both in Genesis together, and both songs sound kind of similar and suck.

      I often do not desire my cereal to stay crunchy in milk. The milk is there as a moistening agent  <em>only</em>  and any leftover milk will be disposed of once the cereal transaction is over. I will often tilt my spoon to drain off excess milk as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It depends on the cereal, but there is an ideal place where it is no longer especially crunchy, but not yet soggy. That is often the ideal. Flakes tend not to lend themselves well to this. Granola often needs extra softening.

      Sorry.  The best cereal ever was formulated in the early 1980s as the product of genetic splicing, as somehow human DNA was spliced with baked goods to form a unholy doo-wop group of edible comestication. <br/>

If you want an unholy alliance of flavor, you need not look any further than: <br/>

 <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100420005340/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xypb5rOwIC0">OJs</a></strong>  - The cereal that tastes like orange juice (in your  <em>milk???</em> ) <br/>

I don't know if OJs failed because of the horrible flavor, or because boxes of the cereal were later found in the grocery store next to torn-open boxes of Nicole Brown-Sugar Adulter-ohs. <br/>

      I just got back from dinner with my parents and grandmother.  We went out to dinner for the first time ever on a Christmas Eve, since it was a small group; I had ahi tuna, a Ketel One martini, though I normally do gin, not exactly Diamond Juice, and a reasonable Pinot Noir (glass, not bottle).  creem brulle to finsh up lol.  Thanks for the dinner, Nana. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now I'm drinking a Guinness (14.9 ounce can with the widget, poured into a stolen-from-a-bar Guinness toucan glass).  Maybe graduate to either some Bushmills 10 or Redbreast later.  Probably the good stuff. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Listened to Christmastime is Here, both vocal and instrumental on my iPod (I got one two years ago from my generous brother for xmas, soupkaty, but just a nano), but now it's onto Smog.  Not very traditional, but hey, I'm just drinking at the dam.  Could put on the Phil Spector holiday album...but no.  Got my only holiday decoration, the store-bought  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100420005340/https://www.maxcostumes.com/p-35986-18-charlie-brown-pathetic-christmas-tree.aspx">Peanuts xmas tree replica</a>  up; a friend bought if for me last week, it's all I really need. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Might do a Williams Street christmas: SGC2C, Aqua Teen, Squidbillies xmas eps on DVD, then tune into TCM at 11:15 to watch Remember the Night.  Why?  Because Barbara Stanwyck is a Woman. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hope everyone is drinking and content, drinking and contemplative, or drinking and sad.  I am not drunk yet, but hopefully will be around 1:00 am. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What are you doing this holiday evening?

      In the bahamas with my family, where it is 81 degrees and the drinking age is 18. Had about 5 mixed drinks with my mom, including one white russian just so I could throw Big Lebowski refenrences back and forth with the bartender. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then went to an extremely nice dinner (which my dad thankfully picked up the tab for). Ordered a diving scallop in a truffle-infused butternut squash soup, a bleu cheese encrusted beef tenderloin au jus with white carrot puree and fresh broccoli, and a pineapple tart with vanilla gelato. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They also brought a complimentary pineapple sorbet and a conch ceviche (or however you spell the thing where the citrus juices cook the shellfish). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Between the wine and the liquor I am rather thoroughly drunk and am now chatting on facebook with college friends. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm listening to Andrew Bird's  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">The Mysterious Production of Eggs</span>  and Radiohead's  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Hail to the Thief</span> . <br/>

      Enjoyed a holiday repast with my sister-in-law's family.  Traditional Ukrainian meatless/dairyless Christmas Even dinner fare, with potato/sauerkraut pirogies and potato and rice golumpkis (Polish spelling on this as I am not Ukrainian), sauteed mushrooms and onions, and with a raft of vodka to wash all down.  Vodka, and several 500 mL Austrian lagers in flip-top bottles that the local beer distributor is trying to get rid of at $20 a case. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Currently wearing my loudest holiday sweater and listening to Joao Gilberto's "A Felicidade" as I type this.  Weather in Philadelphia has turned damned well balmy for such a day, for such a night on a Christmas, and to all my fellow Assetbarrians, I pass along my fondest wishes for a good holiday. <br/>

      That is fucking terrible. Given your reasoning, it seems like you are basically committing suicide by proxy. I urge you to reconsider. Do something like that thing where you go to some country and teach English for a year. <br/>

Also, is that music yours? I notice one of the songs says the photo is taken in New Brunswick. I've been asking for the longest time if there's anyone here in the NYC area, just saying.

      I volunteered for the Marines in 2001. A temporary medical disqualification and a smashed ankle nixed that, and delayed a second attempt for a little over a year. While conditioning myself for a second trip to the recruiter, I injured left hip, which has caused me almost constant grief for the past several years. It's better, now. Not %100, but good enough to try again, and someone has to help hold the line. <br/>

      I chubbied your comment for pluck, heart, and spirit.  But please re-consider: the US military has a noble tradition, but it is now under the control of the single most corrupt organization on the planet: the United States Federal Government.  The reason they, (I don't say "we", because we are not in control, "they" are), invaded Iraq was to kill Saddam Hussein for defying our orders.  We have killed the leaders of many other nations for the same sin.  Please read the book Confessions of an Economic Hit Man before you make a commitment like that.  Then try to integrate that the things that John Perkins tells you in that book are only a small and extremely horrid piece of a much larger and grandly more ghastly truth; a truth the whole of which we will never know.

      I'm not trying to start a whole thing here either, but if I may just be permitted to quickly respond to your very understandable statement. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's what I used to think too.  Read the book.  Just because the US government is not torturing its own citizens does not mean that its vast power is not being used to totally fuck over millions and millions of people in other countries.  This sort of fuck over is not something that is paraded on the evening news.  In fact we hardly ever hear about any of it in mainstream media. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Take that, add the round and regular ripping off the citizens of the 50 states, and then add all the stuff that is truly secret, the stuff that we know nothing about and are never allowed to know anything about, (do you really think that category is empty), and it adds up to a very high corruption score.  Read the book.  It's no joke. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just saying...

      I would think he's being lamed either because 1) some people, like myself, don't want political discussions taking over assetbar and 2) he's taking the information presented in one book and assuming it to be gospel truth. <br/>

But I'm not the one who lamed him, so I don't know.

      On Christmas Eve we had my father-in-law's funeral.  Then we got some pictures and stuff out of his house so they don't get stolen when the house is burglarized, and drove 6hrs back home.  I set up the Polar Express train set that Santa brought for my son.  So here I am now, knowing that life goes on and this strip is really not all that depressing.

      geez, i don't know how to feel about that last comment, except a combination of god bless and can i buy you a beer. <br/> 
anyway, i rode in a car for 3hrs with my family today and have 6 to look forward to tomorrow. we just got to the hotel not to long ago after spending a pleasant evening with my sister and brother in law, who live in a cozy if somewhat tiny and old apartment that's a little on the drafty side. it's walls are covered in posters from original tim burton's nightmare before christmas theatrical posters to pink floyd to an drum head signed by the members of system of a down. we opened presents (not to brag, but i got my sister the acme novelty library by chris ware, who i totally heard about thanks to this comic - she got me a 60 gig ext. hd which was already half full with music from her!), and ate a fantastic meal of ham and potatoes and stuffing and greenbean casserole. my sister was concerned because she had never cooked a meal like that for so many people before, but it turned out great and i could tell she was very proud of it. <br/> 
after dinner, we toured the rotary club light show- imagine a park full of christmas lights and trees and animated christmas light displays put on by local area businesses club and organizations, which you drive through bumper to bumper at about 0-3 mph while me my dad and brother in law chain smoked and listened to bob dylan's like a rolling stone on the radio. the event is organized by the salvation army, and at the end of it we handed a grocery bag full of canned goods out over a not quite broken but just about to die driver side window that rolls up very slowly and doesn't roll down all the way (the way the salvation army folk looked at my brother in law "merry chri- stupid motherfucker!" as he hammered the window down with his bag of canned goods - priceless).  <br/> 
after that we sat around and my dad brother in law and i smoked a few more cigarettes while we talked about friends, insurance companies, psychology, and whatever else drifted in to the conversation. my sister told a particularly heart rending story about her work (at an outpatient clinic for extremely autistic children) about a girl whose brain tumors cause her to have seizures, and this girl can feel these seizures coming on and she's like 8 years old and she'll beg my sister to make it stop but most of the time there isn't much they can do and they just have to wait it out. and that nearly made me tear up, but then after the girl comes out of her seizures she's always just pissed off and screams about how it isn't fair and broke a lamp one time, and that made me put my fist up in the air and say yeah, and then at the end of the story my sister calms the girl down by getting her a cookie and putting in her spongebob dvd, which made me laugh and know the world is okay, sort of. <br/> 
and then we got back to the hotel and i saw this news item on my e-mail inbox home page:  <br/> 
 <br/> 
https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081226/ap_on_re_us/santa_shooting <br/> 
 <br/> 
so, merry christmas everybody! next?

      Okay I'm next! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was laying on the couch playing Chrono Trigger on my DS, waiting for everyone to wake up and open presents.  My dog wasn't very good conversation but at least he was there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My Mother and Father and Sister all came out, we opened gifts (i didn't get anything i didn't want) and had a good morning.  Lyssa made a rockin' breakfast casserole and we ate that.  We also drank.  I was drinking booze for about twelve hours yesterday, that was fun. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Um...  After gifts we pretty much sat around the house all day.  I played on Assetbar and Facebook, read a bit, and shovelled snow in my swim trunks.  We went to friend's for dinner. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I'm really drunk, dinner is awesome, I can't stop hitting on a past babysitter of mine.  I couldn't stop.  I tried to stop, but I could not.  It was okay I suppose, I didn't get yelled at for it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also Wii played Rockband, and I was very drunk. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now I am at work, it is going to be a very slow day. <br/> <br/> <br/> Next!  Is there anyone left?

It was a very nice time, particularly after the excessive drama and tribulations of my past few weeks.  And, I got a new Achewood t-shirt!  The awesome Achewood bierdeckel shirt!

      I left behind 3-4 feet of snow and 10-20 degree (minus 20 wind chill), flying with only a slight (1.5 hour) delay to Raleigh/Durham, and 60-70 degree temps.  Two hour drive to my brother, his wife my new "Little Nephew", Mother and Step-dad. <br/> 
  Thoughtful brother had stocked Sailor Jerry rum and Coke Zero, which I concentrated on depleting (success!)  Home-cooked dinner of deep-fried turkey, two styles of sweet-potato pie, french cut green beans almondine, fresh giblet stuffing and garlic mashed potatoes. <br/> 
  Finished the night off with some rounds of 'Phase 10' card game with entire family, then broke in 'Boom Blox' on the Wii with brother and our wives after the parents had gone to sleep. <br/>

i think i was traumatized when my first boyfriend invited himself over to my house for thanksgiving dinner. we spent a shitload of money buying this and that with my mom screeching the whole time "why did you agree to this, huh? and why do we need a turkey? what if i just make him some dumplings?" and my idiot dad chiming in "what if we just make one huge dumpling in the shape of a turkey? or make lots of small dumplings and shape them into a turkey?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
then at dinner the bf asked us to say grace.  <br/> 
me: uh.. amen? <br/> 
bf: no you have to say something before amen. <br/> 
dad: *elbows me* jesus. heheh heh.. say "jesus, amen" *more chuckles*

      that's the thing, he wasn't. he was kind of a jock, and often liked to assert his alpha maleness through various forms of violence, humorous insults, and not so humorous insults. he vented his rage by playing rugby and counter-strike but would lash out at me sometimes.. like throwing things at me and then apologizing. i believe he has struck his mother.  <br/>

      I'm sitting in my apartment. Just cracked my third 24 ouncer of High Life. My girlfriend and I just got caught up on the last few episodes of Top Chef on the DVR. She whipped up a nice sweet potato curry with rice which is digesting quite well. Now she's in the bedroom playing Animal Crossing. I'm smoking at the computer which is a treat reserved only for when it's below freezing outside, which it certainly is. I'm listening to a playlist that we threw together for a party we had last weekend. Right now it's on some J Dilla joint. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I shouldn't have said joint. That's what I really want for Christmas and we ran out. Besides that, everything is nice. <br/>

Now here comes "Some Mother's Son." That was jarring.

      I'm sitting in my apartment. I just woke up from a three hour nap after having spent a third consecutive day trying to finish a paper that is already two weeks overdue, and not even bringing myself to open the file. If I don't do this and other things soon, I might not finish my degree. I also really need to shave. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not trying to make this depressing (though obviously it is). I did make chicken with garlic & creamy mushroom sauce and baked herbed potatoes, which turned out okay, but I have that fairly often since it's one of about five things I know how to make. I also have two cats at the moment, which makes me somewhat more at peace. My friend who went home for the holidays asked me to take care of his fat cat. Castro reminds me of the cheezburger cat, looks like an armadillo if you see him from the back, and is a lot friendlier than my scrawny little kitten, who keeps jumping at him and then running away. Right now though they are both sleeping on the couch and the size disparity makes it cute. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Shit, talking about my cats makes this even more pathetic, doesn't it? Um... well, my mom is going to a dinner gathering of middle-aged Russian people tomorrow and wants me to go, but the only other kids there will be the host's successful computer programmer son and slutty 17-year old daughter who had an abortion last year. Maybe I should go after all.

autre, can't you just be a waitress? it's easy and you're old enough. you make lots of money just by smiling and  making small talk with people. i mean there's more to it if you work in fine dining, but if you aren't clumsy and your memory and multitasking skills don't totally suck, you should be able to work at a mid-range place and make $100 a night for a 5 hour shift. and that's without wages. just a thought.

      don't you have to go to "bartending school"?  That seems like a waste of money, for a job that might just end up being too ...drunk for me to enjoy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Waitressing seems like it could be alright, but I couldn't really find any places hiring.  I'd love a solo style job, or at least one where I don't work with the public--because so far it has been sleazy, depressing, or forced.  They don't make jobs like that for entry-levelers, though.  Data entry, maybe?  I type at least 90  wpm.  Eh, I suppose I should've started school earlier. <br/>

      Bartending school is a scam. Buy a fat book of mixed drink recipes and learn on the job. Most places you'll only end up ever making maybe half a dozen different nonsensical concoctions regularly anyway, often some simplified cheap-assed version of the original drink to save the house money.

      My stepson's H.S. buddy got him a job as a stocker 10 years ago, after he dropped out of college. He was, and is a gifted programmer. Had an online rep, actually, for RPG characters. <br/> 
 The hardest thing for him was to commit in his mind to Walmart's 'philosophy'. One part of that is to promote smart, hard workers from within. His friend (a smart kid) crapped out and turned into the white trash model you see on wikipedia.  <br/> 
 My stepson stayed with them and vice versa, as he moved up their food-chain. He worked his ass off. You have to commit to that. <br/> 
 Once you're management, it's like the difference between the nobility and peasant class. <br/> 
 He was a hard-ass to work for, but fair, and some of his subordinates were old enough to....well, be his parents.  <br/> 
My daughters went to his store once, and kind of snickered to each other recalling how his bullying ways had turned into an asset. <br/> 
 I never taught him or my son woodworking because I didn't want to ever have to face my wife if they cut themselves up on a table saw. And with her spazz genes, it would have been inevitable. <br/> 
He's very successful doing something I never could have done. <br/> 
 He's bringing his family over later today for the big feed. <br/> 
 The bottom line, autrepoupee and wozzeck, is that  Walmart rewards hard work combined with smarts.

that's ok, my birthday five days ago was good. i was supposed to do the lsd i snuck on the airplane by way of slipping it under the aluminum wrapper of a dove chocolate, in a package of like 20 dove chocolates. pretty clever huh? except i ended up getting so into god of war 2 that i decided i'd rather spend my birthday beating it instead. and i did. and it was awesome. and i had some wine. so much more awesome than my last birthday, when my best friend and i did way too many shrooms at my house and my mom came home to me crawling on the floor in my room with my friend trying to keep her from seeing me, only to faint herself because it was too much to deal with, and then me telling my mom that if i die, i'm sorry for having been a bad daughter, and to please forgive me (i was 100% positive that i was going to die). i still think about it sometimes. it makes me pretty grateful to be around to do much of anything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
though i'm sure i'll have some crazy drug stories to share with you guys before the break is over, never you worry. now i'm going to take a break from looking at job descriptions that contain words like "fast-paced", "competitive", "strong quantitative skills", and "team player" and play with my guinea pig for a bit. and for your curious minds, i am currently wearing baggy pants and a shirt that makes a man want to buy me another shirt.

      When I try to grow a mustache I look like a cross between a teenager and a guy you would not want to buy a car from. It barely comes in at all. Not even enough to qualify as a pencil mustache. <br/>

I lament also that my beard mainly just sticks to my chin. I totally want a full beard. Why must I fail at something where I don't even have to do anything? I'm a bit tired of looking Amish all the time, but it's better than shaving or not having any sort of beard.

      The goatee kinda comes in, but it's also a different color. Much more reddish when most of my hair is more of a deep chestnut brown with auburn highlights. But my soul patch? Hell no.

      belgand, <br/> 
A tip from a fair-haired gentleman with a randomly-varied beard growth: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1) let everything grow for a couple days (get a good stubble on). <br/> 
2) use beard trimmer (or sideburn trimmer from shaver) to trim down the parts that grow rapidly. (leave the slow-growth sections alone) <br/> 
3) allow beard to continue to grow.  This allows the slow sections to get a head start. <br/> 
4) do not mock me, for this worked. (just be wary of the areas you are trimming back--no one wants an "inadvertent hitler")

      No, it's not varied so much as thin. I don't really even get stubble. Or proper sideburns. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just let it grow out to the point that it's long enough to more or less cover up how thin it is. Sadly I'm not getting the length I want. Ideally I'm thinking something more along the lines of wizard or ZZ Top and it just won't happen. *sigh*

belgand, your lack of facial hair makes me believe that you are fair skinned and fair featured and have no body hair. this is most attractive. now could you dye your hair black, put on some eyeliner, and wear a black tank top and fishnet shirt please? after you do that, you and zapatos can make out a little bit. come on guys, is so hot.

      While I would like nothing more than to feed your fantasies (if you do not want to be disillusioned just stop reading now) this is not even remotely true. Brown hair with auburn highlights, slightly dark complexion, average amount of body hair. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't have a  <em>lack</em>  of facial hair, just crappy genes resulting in weak facial hair. I have an Amishy chinstrap because, well, that's what happens when I stop shaving. The mustache won't connect and comes in ludicrously thin like I'm still a teenager or something. Pretty much just like Gabe.

      When I was a bartender/doorman my female coworkers engaged in a pretty constant game of grab-ass, with me as the target. This is a strange experience for an asocial male who's used to unintentionally intimidating, not attracting total strangers. <br/>

Oh and no lady has  <em>ever</em>  been over-sexed. It is simply not possible. Maybe when your Son of Jonathon turns purple with overexertion and tries to fall off and scurry away to a place where maybe it could just lie down for a little while then it is too much, but until it is so bruised that you worry whether you'll ever, physically, be able to get it up again due to the constant advances of horny ladies you have not encountered and over-sexed woman.

      uh basically all 30 or so job descriptions i've looked at so far have had the phrase "team player" in it. seriously, they are not kidding around, they really want us to be those.  <br/>

have you looked into being an actuary? i thought that was what i wanted to do for a while, i even took the P1 exam (the first exam in a series of like 7) and passed it. how are you at statistics? like 50% of the exam is just conditional probability questions. but yea idk, having to keep studying for and taking tests my entire life is basically my definition of not a good time. but it's ideal for dudes who are good at math and want to work more or less alone. i am pretty sure people like you and me would keep from becoming About Schmidt cases.

      <em>Speaking From Personal Experience</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
A bachelor's degree in math is fairly worthless.  It will get you a job teaching high school.  It might get you a job in the software industry, but you totally have to be a "team player" in the software industry. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To get a job actually doing math, such as an actuary, you need a master's at least, and lots of statistics. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What is your minor?  My minor is computer science, which helped me get a job in software.  But the  <em>only interacting with computers for ten hours a day, plus still being a team player</em>  part, plus the 60-80 hour work weeks, burned me out after a couple of years.  The money was good, but still not worth it in the long run. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What is your minor?  Maybe that is where to look for your career.  But you are totally going to need to go back to school if you want almost any job that uses math.

      A friend of mine had the day off work because Google is actually not a dick to their employees so I went over to pick him up and we got way too much Chinese food for lunch. We drove over to the butcher shop I like and got a ham even though they gave me a butt end when I requested a shank end and they only had lame "water added" ham and not one in natural juices. Still, it was an honest ham cut by men in the shop without any glaze packet or spiral slicing or such. It was smoky and delicious. The bone is now sitting in my freezer. I also braved one of the smallest, most cramped Safeways I've ever been in in my life to get some supplies I needed for dinner. We went back to my place and played Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix on the PS3 and Smash Bros. Melee late into the night. We tried going out for dinner, but the Japanese place we like was closed and so was the burger place we like so we ended up going to another Japanese place nearby that is pricier and nicer, but not better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The next day I woke up fairly early and lamented that I had forgotten to make cinnamon rolls the night before because they would have been ideal, but now I wouldn't have enough time to let them rise and such. We walked over to the Asian supermarket that we assumed would be open (and was).  We were unable to find packaged cinnamon rolls, but did find that they now offered char siu bao and some other dim sum options. The pork buns were inferior, but the beef shu mai (pork wasn't ready yet, sadly) were pretty good. We had also needed eggs or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I made the glaze from Good Eats for the ham (cover with brown mustard, lightly pack with brown sugar, lightly pack with crushed ginger snaps) and it was excellent. The same friend from the day earlier came by as he was the only other person we knew in town that was not currently traveling to Central America for vacation because they're Israeli and Christmas doesn't matter. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The day after we started packing heavily to move over the weekend. It took the entire weekend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have no plans for New Years. Everyone else I know in town except my girlfriend is now gone away and we don't drink so we can't even just head out to bars. It feels very empty and sad.

      I had cinnamon rolls that my dad made on Christmas morning! They were delicious, despite some early-morning drama (I had not known about the plan to make rolls, and I was making biscotti.

      Twas the night before Christmas and all through the 'Bar. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not a poster was stirring, both near and far. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The chubbies were hung on the Photoshops, made with no care. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In hopes that doc_rostov soon would be there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
SJE and catgrl were nestled all snug in their beds. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While visions of BARY'S danced through their heads. <br/> 
 <br/> 
With me wide awake trying to fall asleep, <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hit F5 repeatedly while counting sheep. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When out on the internet it popped up with a clatter! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I sprang to Achewood.com to see what was a matter! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Away to the window I switched in a flash <br/> 
 <br/> 
In hopes that finally Firefox wouldn't crash. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When what did my wondering eyes did appear, <br/> 
 <br/> 
A Christmas strip with young Roast Beef was quick to be here! <br/> 
 <br/> 
What a dry sense of humor, so dark and bleak. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's basically what makes Achewood so unique. <br/> 
 <br/> 
and I pictured Chris Onstad in California, drawing the last panel with delight, <br/> 
 <br/> 
saying, "Merry Christmas to All, and to all a good night!!" <br/>

      These conflicting "codes" made up the entirety of the film's moral subtext. Ken was willing to die for justice, Harry was willing to die for honour, and by the end Ray simply wanted to live despite it all. That, at least, you should be able to empathise with. <br/>

      True, but I wanted less moral subtext in my comedy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also found that, yes I understand why, but I think it was rather silly that Ken prevented Ray from committing suicide when he was just about to kill him. He should have just let it work itself out. Saved everyone the bother. In the end he just made things worse. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was just too mixed. Give me either all moral subtext crime drama with maybe a few jokes as is the natural way of all things or give me more comedy and less heavy subtext and drama. It was like oil and water to me.

      While I agree that  <em>Dude</em>  is a rather excellent movie, and probably, unfortunately, the peak of Ashton Kutcher's career (besides  <em>That 70's Show</em> ) I just find it weird that belgand criticizes my love of Will Ferrell and then admits to loving a comedy movie that is decidedly more low-brow than anything Ferrell has put out.

      I like Dude, but I do not like Will Ferrell. I think the difference is that Dude's stupidity relied more on random and extreme absurdity in the vein of Aqua Teen, whereas to me all of Will Ferrell's movies seem to be about laughing at his bumbling mannerisms and him wearing silly clothes that expose too much of his hairy legs. I have met intelligent people who like Will Ferrell though, so I am content to leave this in the realm of opinion, as opposed to most of my other preferences which are based soundly on incontrovertible facts.

      I saw Anchorman opening weekend, and have seen it on DVD something like 10 times now. <br/>

I recommend the "Unrated" version, only because it has better lines from Steve Carrell. <br/>

The only movie I've seen as much as Anchorman is Rushmore.

Because it is polite.  You should never address anyone by his or her first name until they have given you permission to do so.

      polite is holding a door open for a person, lighting their cigarette for them, offering them something from your cabinet or refrigerator when they come to visit, etc. calling somebody mr. ms. or mrs. is the sort of thing you're doing when you're applying for a home loan, talking to a professor you don't like, or testifying in a court of law. obviously, this is clearly a matter of personal taste - and i'll be the first to admit mine is at best highly idiosyncratic and at worst seemingly completely absent - but formal titles seem too impersonal to me. y'all can do what you like, but i'm just going to wonder if he prefers christopher or chris until i see a message from him on here saying he prefers to addressed as mr. onstad.

      I don't feel any need to call him any particular thing.  But it is not my choice.  He decides what he wants us to call him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will call him whatever he wants me to call him. <br/>

But I have not heard anything from him concerning what he wants to be called.  Absent any input from him, I will continue to address him as "Mr. Onstad." <br/>

      Always call cops "Sir". Never be a cock to a cop because they carry shooty and beaty things, and some of them get scared way too easily.  <br/> <br/> <br/> Also, if you end up in a fight with 6 cops trying to subdue you, they're going to win one way or the other. <br/>

      Very true. Be polite and respectful and they're far more likely to be polite and respectful back. Either they're a good person with what it honestly a pretty shitty job or they're a power-hungry fuck-bag who wants to be treated like a big man. It works for either case. <br/>

      I just moved into Haight-Ashbury and no. Here you actually see a lot of people with Mercedes, BMWs, Audis, and oh so trendy Minis and SmartCars (which make sense because they're small, but it was also hard to get one I'm told). They have dogs and less often baby strollers. They own houses. Gentrified to hell yo. Lots of expensive boutiques next to smoke shops and t-shirt places aimed at the tourists. Tons of fairly aggressive or at least loud homeless kids living on the street many of whom seem to be doing so more as a lifestyle choice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We're becoming increasingly gentrified as a city and the middle class is leaving in droves because they can't afford it here. <br/>

Still, I saw a guy on the train with my exact coat last night so that's something.

      Fun fact you didn't want to know about me: I revert to Spanish or German in texts when it's easier to type because I have principles and never abbreviate.  So like "last night" is "anoche" and "thanks" is "danke" which only saves one letter but still.

      Nope.  If I were to make my own language, which I have several times since childhood, it would be an amalgam of English, Spanish, pseudo-German, inside jokes, silly noises, and phonetic spellings of words I find entertaining to say in English.  No grammar system other than "same as English."  Esperanto, eat yer heart out.

      Yeah seriously. And what is up with Japanese people using kanji? Make your own system! And don't make it so you have to learn each one individually because you can't sound them out! You guys have such simple grammar, and then you had to eff the language up by borrowing from the chinese. God.

      As a guy who's left himself a fortnight to revise a term's worth of kanji (About 200) I heartily agree with this sentiment. I always have the hardest time explaining why in the hell they use kanji when I'm telling people about Japanese.

      I get the impression that it's because the Japanese associate difficulty with elegance. All of the words that kanji is used for can actually be written in hiragana, but that's only done in children's books and such.

      That was a half joke but what you say is valid, I'll go with that.  The main thing I was getting across was we said words differently but in ways that employed the use of all the letters in the word, probably few silent syllables/consonants, etc.  I'm not a linguist but that's what I gather from Various Sources.

      i live somewhat near edina, mn, one of the most obscenely wealthy areas of the world, below perhaps only beverly hills and dubai. also, a strikingly conservative community, if one tries to asses that on a community wide level, not the sort where one would assume a branch manager of a reputable bank would be giving out business cards to car living folk. not that there couldn't be extenuating factors, or that conservatives or people from edina have never been said to have "done good things for many people." <br/> 
 <br/> 
so, i decides to punch in the address on google maps to find the happenstance and maybe figure out where this whole plot arc (is this a plot arc?) is headed. (especially about the post with the newspaper clipping). <br/> 
 <br/> 
and whadya know, 2512 s walker is in minneappolis. not edina. it's close, it's sorta right on the border between the city and it's suburb, and having never been to the address myself i can't confirm (also i have no idea what zoning was like in south mpls metro), but i'm pretty sure that's a bona fide fictitious address

      Very true. As a child my address was very firmly in Overland Park, but we would often be shown by the post office or such to be living in Shawnee Mission when we most definitely did not really live or get our mail delivered from anywhere near there. Both are suburbs of Kansas City, but it was a quirk that it showed up as such. <br/>

      When I was in Korea I bought produce from farmers who drove their single-cylinder diesel tractors (with seats made out of old engine belts stretched between rusty pieces of re-bar) into town.  Hunch-backed old women (it was usually the women who went to market) maybe 4 1/2 feet tall, with leathery brown skin, 5 or 6 brown teeth in their purple gums, and their fingernails hanging off their gnarled fingers almost by the roots with dirt buried under the nail almost all the way down.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The worst part of the experience for the shopper, though, was there would be a dozen or so people set up in the same market, all selling exactly the same vegetables, or nearly so.  And if you bought from one, you'd get dirty looks from the others around them.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The traditional East Asian ideal of feminine beauty tends towards wanting skin to be as white as possible.  Many people mistake that for a desire to be like caucasians, but they're wrong.  It goes back much farther than that.  White skin means you aren't out in the sun doing back-breaking labor.  South Korea is one of the places you can still see what it is against which people wished to contrast themselves.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And about the tractors...you'd see them rolling down the highway at maybe 10 miles per hour.  Cars would be backed up behind them, honking their horns, passing when they could, their drivers gesturing angrily.  The elderly farmers on the tractors pay no mind.  That's the part that made me smile.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyhow, those people are poor.

Tonight I went to a bar for karaoke and drinkin' with some friends. I am now slowly sobering up at home and I just took a dump. After releasing my load, I stood to see what I had wrought, and it was beautiful; one of the smoothest turds I ever did see. I named it Randy before flushing. Then I looked at the wall and noticed that a tear in the wallpaper totally looked like a penguin. <br/>

      I was too drunk for the idea of making fun of something to really formulate. I just thought it would be a funny thing to post at the time. <br/>

Anyway, I don't have a problem with the occasional blog-esque post, as long as it's at least somewhat amusing, or relevant or whatever. But we should avoid doing it all the time.

      I've just finished version 0.8 of Assetbarista, my GreaseMonkey script for Firefox that enhances the Assetbar user interface. <br/> 
 <br/> 
New in this release is an improvement to the code that cleans up the display of non-ASCII characters (non-Western-European languages, special symbol characters, etc).  In earlier releases, if you posted a comment containing special characters, you'd have to reload the page to see the Unicode characters displayed properly.  In v0.8, Assetbarista attempts to fix up the formatting of any Unicode in your message as soon as you post it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're interested in such things, please download this new release from the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100420005340/https://www.brianp.net/achewood/assetbarista.html">Assetbarista</a>  home page and give it a try. <br/>

      goddammit. you people and your gifts. the only actual "gift" i got was a package of 250 lisa frank stickers and temporary tattoos from a chick that does way too many psychedelics. and i think even that was for my birthday. everyone else in my family prefers the "go get yourself something" tactic. my parents are all "happy birthday, happy christmas, go get yourself something". my grandparents called and both sides were all "get lots of rest over the break and go get yourself something, on our behalf".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
but it's kind of unsatisfying when you've had access to your parents' credit card account ever since you were in middle school and they've always told you "our money is your money" so basically it's like uh, why would i want to spend my own money? so i didn't buy myself anything. basically asians are the worst thing that can happen to the economy, ever.

      I kind of have to agree with zapatos here; Futurama is pretty good and I like it alright, but when people try to talk up Futurama over (the first 9 years of) the Simpsons, I just want to piss in their mouths and make them gargle the wrongness of it all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I haven't seen any of the movies, but two friends of mine who are big Futurama fans hated the first one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's probably stupid to bring up a Simpsons vs. Futurama argument here; that's probably pretty big elsewhere on the internet, right?  Sorry, I don't get around on the internet as much these days, mostly due to apathy.

      The first season of the Simpsons was horrible. The second season had a few high points, but it was still struggling to get good. It wasn't really until season three that it was great. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I love them both equally and for different reasons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let us also not forget that both The Critic and Mission Hill were also great. Proof that ex-Simpsons show runners can go on to make other great animated series that will be canceled before their time. <br/>

      I liked  <em>Making Money</em> , but  <em>Going Postal</em>  was really good and would have been very difficult to top. Probably Pratchett's best book since  <em>The Last Continent</em> .  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would love a new Rincewind novel as well. But I don't think Pratchett has plans to write any more; he doesn't feel there's much more he can do with the character.  <em>The Last Hero</em>  was pretty good though, and I liked its use of Rincewind.

      Esh, I unpreferred Making Money, personally. And you're quite right about Night Watch being somewhat lacking in the larf department. <br/>

Feet of Clay might well be my favourite, although Small Gods is good and Mort will always be wonderful. Maskerade is quite the classic, too, mainly because I don't want to leave the witches out. <br/>

      I generally dislike the witches. Frankly my bigger problem with the recent books is how much he keeps advancing the technology level. I mean, yes, I realize he's doing it in order to be able to parody and satirize various aspects of our modern world, but it's gotten to the point that you need to read each book as they come out to be up on what's happening in the world.

      Eric? Really? That one always really underwhelmed me for some reasons. Thinking about it, I can kind of see why some people aren't fans of Rincewind. He's entertaining, and pretty out-there as far as protagonists go, but he hasn't got as much depth as some other characters and he tends to end up playing second fiddle to someone who actually has the required personality to advance the storyline. <br/>

      Represeeeeent. There have been loads of stage adaptations for the Discworld books, but as far as I'm aware he hasn't written any himself. They were all adapted by *runs to Discworld shelf* Stephen Briggs. I hear some of them actually lend themselves quite well to the stage, but I don't see how myself. Can you have footnotes in a play? <br/>

      Haha.  Well, I also have a half sister, but she is much older and never lived with us. <br/> 
I don't think it's a zoo.  My brother moved out, and I go to college, so it's not that bad.  But my cousin (he is 20) moved in with us because his father kicked him out (and his mother died).   <br/> 
I'm sure it must have been more of a zoo when he were a lot younger, but four kids isn't exactly huge.  Just a little bigger than average.   <br/> 
Also, my mother did not graduate high school.  But she is smart, so, you know.

      Pogo,  <em>Carvinale</em>  is extremely awesome. But be warned; after the second season it abruptly disappears into thin air with no kind of closure whatsoever. It's kind of heartbreaking if you've gotten into the story. I would still argue that the first (and only) two seasons are worth watching, but I just wanted to give you a heads up. It died without an ending.

      I have watched  <em>Deadwood</em>  twice through on DVD (final season only once).  And I plan to watch it through again at least once more. <br/>

I liked  <em>Rome</em> , even though they sort of just stuck a ribbon on it at the end and said "There, it's finished!!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I am saying so ineptly is that I found the TV shows worth watching on DVD, even if they sort of just end off into space. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are so few good TV shows out there that I will put up with unresolved plot points to get to watch one.

      I don't like  <em>Titanic</em>  anyway, so your point is invalid. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wasn't trying to say that this Rome show was BAD, because I've never seen it. It's just, that's probably why historically based shows probably don't last as more than miniseries, we know how the story ends and most serialized television stays on the air because people want to be drawn in and, ultimately, to find out how it ends.

      They have more than just a few year's history of the city to work from. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And no, the series didn't end with the fall of Rome.  There were glory years left after the point where the last episode ended. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The  <em>Titanic</em>  only had one episode it its existence, so it doesn't really apply even if  <strong>theguitarhero</strong>  liked it.

      It's actually not about the history, really, but about the people involved in the history, and the two most interesting characters are legionnaires mentioned in Ceasar's journals, and brought to life by the writers.  Their adventures weave through the stuff about Ceasar and Celopartra, etc., in a most entertaining way.  Lots of good fighting, too.

      It is probably the most realistic depiction of post-Civil War life in the West ever made for the movies or TV. <br/>

I can't say that authoritatively, but I am a fairly well-informed amateur.  It is certainly more realistic than 97% of TV Westerns, at least.

      Well, my understanding of the definition of synecdoche is that it basically refers to the fact that everything we experience is (unavoidably) filtered through the bias of our own experiences and mindset. It is subconscious propaganda performed on ourselves by our own mind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So "in the court of my eyes" would actually fit perfectly with synecdoche. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also,  <em>Synecdoche, New York</em>  is a fantastically brilliant film.

      Synecdoche is when you use a word that is a part of something else to refer to that something else. <br/> 
 <br/> 
An example is saying "the throne" or "the crown" when you're talking about the King. Like "This is a severe insult to the crown!" (In that case it could even mean the entire concept of regal dignity, not just the one king.)  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or when you say "I just got my wheels back from the shop." When you say "wheels" you're talking about your car.

I still don't even understand what "in the court of my eyes" even  <em>means</em> .  The metaphor is, clearly, the court.  Is "my eyes" supposed to represent the whole, i.e. rowboat?  Or is "in my eyes" supposed to be "in my opinion", in which case it is a metaphor?   ..  .I don't know.  I'm confused.

Synecdoche (pronounced "si-NEK-duh-kee", IPA: /s%u026A%u02C8n%u025Bkd%u0259%u02CCki/; from Greek sinekdohi (%u03C3%u03C5%u03BD%u03B5%u03BA%u03B4%u03BF%u03C7%u03AE), meaning "simultaneous understanding") is a figure of speech in which: <br/> 
 <br/> 
* a term denoting a part of something is used to refer to the whole thing (Pars pro toto), or  <br/> 
* a term denoting a thing (a "whole") is used to refer to part of it (Totum pro parte), or  <br/>

      Not sure I can agree it was brilliant. It was... ambitious, but I'm not entirely certain it lived up to it. It just became far too self-reflexive and lost the tentative strains of the plot it had originally. At a certain point it felt way too much like it looped back on itself and its own creation one too many times. I mean, eventually it felt like he was just adding to the script each day as he went along.

      If that means they're staying in the Bay Area that means either the slightly closer suburbs, the city itself, or Marin. I doubt he's making enough money to be moving to Marin though although it's certainly possible as I believe there are some cheaper places up there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, Marin is for assholes. Or people who don't mind having to get dicked hard for driving on the Golden Gate Bridge which has no public transit. Yeah, it's pretty, but since only rich assholes tend to live in Marin I could do without it. <br/>

      Nah, California still has you guys beat with "Eureka!" referring both to the discovery of gold and the fact that this is indeed the place (and well it better be because you aren't going much further west unless you swim). Also, we have a nice, simple flag that totally works. It has a bear on it (a bear, that I am told, which is now extinct), it says "California" it looks like the sort of thing you could maybe draw. If I remembered my heraldry better I could even describe the damn thing properly without too much effort. A good, solid flag. Maybe the bear maul and eat you for disagreeing, yes?

      My motto is much more like "Live Free or Maybe Move Away or Just Do Whatever the Scary, Dangerous People Tell You To Do. Let's Just All Be Cool Here." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sort of like the oft-quoted line from  <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>  I don't respect someone who dies for a cause. Dying for a cause? Very stupid thing to do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps a slight example? In AP US History we ran some sort of simulation where we were in small groups as the various colonies just prior to the revolution. Allegedly (though this turned out not to be true) our score was going to be related to the points we were allocated in the simulation and when the British started invading you lost your points when they beat your ass down. I, for whatever reason, was in charge of the military for whatever colony I was in. Seeing others get their asses thoroughly and being unable to work anything else out with the others in my group or the British I went to the teacher and offered the proposal that as the commander of the military I might be able to convince a large enough portion of my troops to either go rogue or otherwise be in the wrong place at the right time in order to reach a deal with the British where I would be allowed to keep my points and gain asylum in Britain. It worked, I kept my points, and in the end the points had nothing to do with your grade. I still view my outside-the-box ideas to be worthy of a better grade alone. Plus, I still consider it winning since I got out alive with my amassed wealth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then there was the time I used various aspects of the rules in an earlier year's Treaty of Versailles simulation (when I controlled Russia and had a do-nothing partner) to offer land and resources to other countries in exchange for their militaries (thus creating protectorates under the pretense that we'd be much stronger that way), then backstabbed them and with my superior military and their complete lack of one outright conquered them. The US vaguely caught on late in the game (and could have crushed me being the only stronger power at that point), but never managed to impose any real sanctions against me in the actual treaty because I largely ignored their Western European allies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once again history class is enhanced by being a devious bastard out to win at any costs and applying actual historical knowledge. Sometimes I feel that by working outside or barely within the confines of what was intended I was able to provide a more realistic scenario than what was originally intended.

      Martyrdom is only stupid if it accomplishes nothing, silly. <br/> 
Live Free or Die isn't necessarily pointless martyrdom.  .. its saying that you would die in order that freedom would reign.  Not just in the state, but in general.  Giving your life in order to ensure that others besides yourself are free is a very noble and not "stupid" at all, a priori.

      1.  Humans don't have instincts.  Trust me, they don't. <br/> 
2.  Humans  <em>do</em>  sacrifice themselves.  There have been many examples of this, and you know it. <br/> 
3.  Even if a lot of humans do aim for self-preservation above everything else, that does not make it noble.  Sacrifice is noble.  Do the opposite of human nature to save others in moble. <br/> 
 <br/>

      Humans do have instincts. It is asinine to suggest otherwise. You know your sex drive? And that pain you get in your stomach when you're hungry? And the fight-or-flight reflex that activates when you perceive yourself to be in danger? Those are all instincts. The latter two examples are manifestations of the instinct for self-preservation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sacrifice is not inherently noble. And noble is a subjective term anyhow, so it's all in the eye of the beholder. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I wouldn't say belgand sounds like a moron. But I would say you sound naive.

An instinct is specific behavior that is not learned and can not be unlearned. It is the capacity to learn, and to therefore adapt one's behavior to changes in environment, which intelligence is the measure of.

      I didn't say sacrifice is not inherently noble.  That is when it is stupid.  But I would not say it is inherently stupid either.   <br/> 
Yes, they are subjective terms.  I feel most people would agree with me though.  There is nothing inherently stupid or unnoble about sacrifice.  Self-sacrifice can often be very smart if it accomplishes what you want, and it is very noble if what you are trying to accomplish is for a good cause, such as the lives of others.

      This is a silly argument. I am not an objectivist in the least, but my basic problem with self-sacrifice is this: how do you know that your sacrifice will accomplish anything if you are not alive to make sure that the right results were achieved? Let's say you throw yourself onto a grenade to save the rest of your platoon, and two minutes later, a bomb is dropped on all of them? <br/>

When I die, for all intents and purposes, the world ends. Any belief otherwise requires some level of self-deception.

      And regardless, sacrificing your life to save specific people from certain death in a given situation is a very, very different thing from sacrificing your life for some abstract idea on a national and political level. It strikes me as a very odd idea that the color of a flag or even taxation without representation are things that are worth even one person's life, and I think people who believe this are slightly insane.

      I'm not sure if the level of abstractness matters as long as the martyrdom is practical.  If I allow myself to starve to death to prevent war, that is very noble and all .. .but dumb because I am a nobody and war can not be stopped by one person dying.   <br/> 
The Nobleness is a factor too, of course. Dying for your country does not seem inherently noble.  If your die, however, fighting to free slaves or something, that is noble.  So I agree with you with this.   <br/>

      You can't know anything for sure.  You could donate money to a respected charity, and it could end up at the hands of neonazi pornographers.  That doesn't make your charity any less noble.  Yes, a bomb could be dropped on all of them, but wouldn't you die with them?  You have to make calculations to make sure that your noble act results in the most happiness.  This is what makes self-sacrifice stupid or not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You say that for all intents and purposes the world ends.  Intents for what, however?  Purposes for what?  For you.  Only for you.  Other people still live.  If you don't care if they die after you die, you are a selfish person.

      Yes, but there are two different levels of being selfish. I would wager that most people who act in unselfish ways do so because it improves their relations with others and makes  <em>their</em>  world a better place. I don't mean this in the Objectivist sense that all unselfish are ultimately calculated to achieve particular selfish ends, but more in the Kantian sense that benevolence helps to create a better world which you would want to live in. But when you die, you cannot live in this world, you cannot experience it, and you cannot even continue knowing that it is there. Your own consciousness is the foundation for all your knowledge of the world, all your ethical judgments, and all your concepts of value. Once it ends, all those things end too.

      That's not being a douche. That's being rational. Quite honestly, I don't believe that people who say they would sacrifice their life for their family or loved one have given the matter much thought. For one thing, if the love is reciprocal, wouldn't the other person want to do the same thing for you? Or, if they were in the endangered situation, wouldn't they NOT want you to sacrifice your life for them, for the same reason that you would want to? Whose preference is more valuable in that case?

      If the love is reciprocal, yes, this would happen.  Boy offers to die to save girl, and girl gets mad and wants to die for the boy.  Boy wants the girl to be happer, and the only way she could be happy is not to die a painful death.  And the only way Boy could be happy is if he doesn't die a painful death.  It doesn't really matter who is the one to die, or whose preference is more valuable.  The are equally noble.  So boy will tell girl to shut up and he is the one to die, because he doesn't want the girl to choose to be unhappy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, love isn't always reciprocal.  In fact, love shouldn't need to be reciprocal.

      So in a situation where you are definitely going to die, but you have two options to die: <br/> 
1. You die and so do ten other people <br/> 
or <br/> 
2. You die and the ten people are saved <br/> 
you would just flip a coin?  Because, you know, since you're not going to live it doesn't matter whether the others live or not. <br/> 
Also, I'm not a Kantian or an expert on Kantianism, but I get the feeling that you don't understand.  A better would that you would want to live in.  If everyone is willing to have self-sacrifice to save others, wouldn't that be a world you'd want to live in?  No one said that you have to be the one who self-sacrifices.

      Very true. The thing that most people are missing is that it is very unlikely that the situation will manifest itself in such clear terms, like Dr. Evil suspending you and your girlfriend over a shark tank and telling you to choose. Much more likely, it will be something like trying to pull someone out of a burning building. And in that case, the analogy is not apt, because there will still be a chance, however small, that you will also survive. So unless you have the consequences and choices laid out clearly in front of you, which you probably won't, it will be a matter of your compassionate instinct versus your self-preservation or fear instinct, the result of which may have very little to do with what you logically believe.

      This splitting hairs over psych terminology doesn't interest me. My point is that all of these things (reflexes, learned reflexes, instincts) are not rational and conscious decisions, and neither is diving to push someone out of the way of an oncoming car, or on the other hand, running out of a burning building instead of staying to look for a family member. You can make all sorts of claims about what should be done in those situations, but that says very little about the way you would actually act.

      Whether I'm being desperate is irrelevant to the discussion.   <br/> 
There are things called words and things called concepts, and words represent concepts.  We need to make sure we agree on a definition in order to discuss concepts intelligently.   <br/> 
A reflex is an automatic, unconscious reaction to a stimulous, and is different from an instinct because an instinct is not conscious and not automatic.  An instinct is thought out, like birds building a nest.  A reflex is more . ..mechanical than that.   <br/> 
An instinct is "complex pattern of behavior present in every specimen of a particular species, that is innate, and that cannot be overridden."  I don't know of any complex set of behaviors human do that can't be overridden.  Humans, for example, commit suicide, while every other species--that I know of--do not.  Humans have free will, self-reflection, and intelligence.   <br/> 
Because humans can decide to die, we know that it is not an instinct, and certainly not a more mechanical reflex, that humans have that make them not want death.  It is more of a drive.   <br/> 
So what does this have to do with anything?  You claim that a person is stupid for not following an instinct?  Or are you saying that a person  <em>won't</em>  decide to let himself die?  The first is confused, and the second is false.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
so let's change the first one.  It is stupid for a person to die, but not because it is an intinct.  Because it's a drive then?  I don't see what makes it stupid to deny a drive.   <br/> 
Now let's see Elbox's explanation.  Sure, you have no idea what is going to happen.  And kant does not concern himself with consequences, only with following his teleological set of ethics.  If you are saying that Suicide goes against the categorical imperative (which I believe it does) then don't commit suicide and let others die.  But would you do this, Elbox?  Are you a Kantian?  I get the feeling that most people are not strict Kantians.   <br/> 
Also, it is true that people don't know what they are going to do until the situation arises.  I fail to see how this is relevant.  We know that both is possible; a person can self-sacrificing or not.  What we are discussing is the morality and intelligence of each option, and you know what I said about nobleness and rationality.

      Yea, but then you get into meta-ethics - on what criteria are we justified in proclaiming something to be moral or immoral? I am of the opinion that to some extent, ethical statements can't really apply to extreme situations where a person probably wouldn't use their normal rational decision-making process. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Furthermore, I would say that if most people would act in a certain way on a fundamental level, then any theory that condemns it as immoral is somewhat meaningless, and I do believe that most people would actually not sacrifice themselves, regardless of what they say. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Finally, (and this is related to the previous point), I would be inclined to say that it does not even matter whether one's decision to save oneself would be approved or disapproved of. Existence is a necessary condition for even being subject to any sort of judgment, and not existing is worse than any imaginable scorn, shame, or disapproval you would suffer as a result of saving yourself. So even in the rational calculus, self-preservation wins out.

      For you existing is worse than the scorn and shame. That is, for you, your personal feelings, so you would most likely act in a self-preserving way.  And everyone else would mock you because, in their opinion, you acted in an immoral way.  It doesn't matter if you can hear them or not.   <br/> 
But yes, in the rational calculus self-preservation does win out .. . for you.  And you only. <br/>

I think I'm an emotivist, by the way.  I think all moral statements are basically "Boo to that" and "Yay  to that".

      I'm not claiming anyone is stupid for following or not following an instinct. I'm just saying, we have instincts. I didn't say they can't be overridden; in fact, I said in a post somewhere in this thread that we have a level of sentience that allows us, to some extent or another, to not follow our instincts or at least have great control over what actions our instincts cause.

      Instincts are generally considered to be  <em>inborn.</em>   Unlearned and unlearnable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That concept is innate in the discussion of instincts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Explanations offered for why humans have no instincts are many and varied.  But they mainly focus on our cognitive abilities, our learning potential, and our self-awareness. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think "instinct" can be used to describe many different things.  If you touch something hot, you pull away.  That could be considered  <em>instinctive</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is also something that can be overridden by someone with the proper training, or the proper exigent conditions.  So if I take that view, I am saying that instinct can be overridden by humans. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I guess I am saying that humans have instincts, actions and behaviors that are inborn and thoughtless.  I am also saying that instincts can be overridden, by thoughtful action.

      Well, I guess you have a different definition of instinct than the scientific community, because, by definition, instincts can't be overridden.  However, drives can be.  Perhaps since the common definition of drive is equivalent to your definition of instinct, perhaps life will prove easier to you if you used the word "drive" instead? <br/>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Some sociobiologists and ethologists have attempted to comprehend human and animal social behavior in terms of instincts. Psychoanalysts have stated that instinct refers to human motivational forces (such as sex and aggression), sometimes represented as life instinct and death instinct. This use of the term motivational forces has mainly been replaced by the term instinctual drives.<br/>
<br/>
Instincts in humans can also be seen in what are called instinctive reflexes. Reflexes, such as the Babinski Reflex (fanning of the toes when the foot is stroked), are seen in babies and are indicative of stages of development. These reflexes can truly be considered instinctive because they are generally free of environmental influences or conditioning.<br/>
<br/>
Additional human traits that have been looked at as instincts are: sleeping, altruism, disgust, face perception, language acquisitions, "fight or flight" and "subjugate or be subjugated". Some experiments in human and primate societies have also come to the conclusion that a sense of fairness could be considered instinctual, with humans and apes willing to harm their own interests in protesting unfair treatment of self or others.[1][2]<br/>
<br/>
Other sociologists argue that humans have no instincts, defining them as a "complex pattern of behavior present in every specimen of a particular species, that is innate, and that cannot be overridden." Said sociologists argue that drives such as sex and hunger cannot be considered instincts, as they can be overridden. This definitory argument is present in many introductory sociology and biology textbooks,[3] but is still hotly debated.</em></div> <br/>

      There are geologists who believe the Earth is 6000 years old.  Plus I don't think I said "universal" agreement anyway.  The main belief is that using the definition in the last paragraph, which I think is the most accepted definition, humans don't have instincts.  I can't think of any at least, using that definition.

      Well, by definition, a geologist is a scientist.  And scientists go by evidence.  (That's what science is.)  And there is no evidence that would lead any  <em>scientist</em>  to believe the earth is only 6000 years old. <br/>

For the non-biology types it is the very simple process by which a small amount of DNA is amplified into a much larger quantity of DNA by the use of an enzyme and a heat cycling device. It is very clever and works very well and can be misused in clever ways to do even more interesting things.

I was just saying that as an examplke.  I assumed that there were certified geologiest who believe that whether you think they are "real scientists" or not.   <br/> 
Anyway, about the Young Earth geologists . .. I just said that because I was reminded of a story in The God Delusion about a talented geology student at Harvard who had a huge internal conflict because he knew that hecouldn't reconcile his religious beliefs with his scientific knowledge, and he ended cutting up his Bible, ridding it of anything that contradicts his scientific knowledge.  And then he chose the Bible anyway and threw away his future.

      As far as I recall, yes. Poke a baby in the cheek or such and it will instinctively turn its head and try to suck. There's also some sort of very interesting reflex to be had by spraying (such as with a syringe) very, very, astoundingly ice cold water deep into someone's ear. It is apparently a test for brain death and as I was told is NOT to be done as a prank.

      League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is much the same except almost every background character is a reference or character from 19th century literature. Even with the guide online it's tough to get absolutely everything. <br/>

From Hell was also very good. Do not trust how terrible the movie was. The book was excellent. It was not a mystery either. You know who the Ripper is from the very beginning and follow him along the way.

      Look, I know we're supposed to automatically think that every movie adaptation of a graphic novel is awful and terrible and the book was so much better, but I actually didn't see much wrong with the movie, and the scene towards the end where the extent of the doctor's insanity is revealed gave me chills.

      I totally believed that Heather Graham was a whore. Does that count for something? Saying Johnny Depp was pretty cool in it practically goes without saying as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just didn't feel that it adapted the novel at all really. It took the idea that it was about Jack the Ripper and the proposed identity of him that it uses (though that it a common one) and kind of made a basic sort of film about it much like many others. It wasn't life-threateningly bad, but it just wasn't very good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do get tired of not liking things actually. I feel that there is a lot of product coming out that shows how terrible our culture is. Like "Bride Wars". That makes us all, as a people, worse just for existing. The creators should be beaten with pipes. Proper lead ones like you don't find so often these days. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would prefer it if there were more things around that I did like, but sadly Sturgeon's Law is largely correct. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously though, read the comic, it was great. I liked it very much. While on the subject though I rather liked both versions of V for Vendetta even though the film was clearly at odds with the book in many cases (e.g. the fundamental concepts of anarchy), but it did a fair job of adapting it and trying, roughly, to translate it into a modern viewpoint that would work more for an American audience (as well as, I hope, a British one) that is likely less familiar with the Thatcher government. Not that it's excusable for Americans to not be familiar with the Iron Bitch, but still.

      That is weird, because I actually thought V for Vendetta suffered from logically implausible plot developments and just felt kind of stilted and rushed. Style-wise it was great, of course, but I thought the same about From Hell, especially the cinematography and the tastefully exaggerated reddish smog covering London. I mean if you compare the movies to each other rather than to their respective sources, I think From Hell fares better.

      Taft was awesome on the good Tick show, not the crappy live-action one that wasn't very good or really at all like either other version. <br/>

He was also unique in having served on the Supreme Court (the only president to do so)  <em>after</em>  his presidential term making him one of the only presidents to go on to serve in a high-level government capacity after his term. <br/>

      I shockingly enough have faith in Zack Snyder that he won't fuck it up horribly. Excluding his remake of  <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>  (which was actually pretty good up to the zombie baby part then it just kinda fell apart) he has made it fairly evident that, with adaptations, he knows how to handle the source material well. Granted, 300 was more a picture book with very little depth and not so much a comic book, but from the trailers of Watchmen it looks like he's doing a fairly faithful recreation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only difference I've heard of so far is the obvious (the crimefighting group being called the Watchmen and not Minutemen) and one fairly big change (the ending will be different because apparently the original ending didn't translate well to film without being too comical) but even then I still have faith in the movie.

      I heard it was coming out at the same time as the movie, but that Snyder also wanted to release a extended version with it still in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This extended cut is rumored to be up to 4 hours long, which is why the studio asked Snyder to cut the Freighter stuff in the first place.

      I have absolutely no idea how the new ending is. I just created something that seemed like a terrible new Hollywood happy ending that would directly contradict just about everything and vastly change the entire story, the original ending, and everything the work was trying to say and accomplish with the ending. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I said "him" I did not mean Rorschach, but, well, I think you know who I mean. I'm trying to keep it spoiler-free. Sort of why I didn't bring up why making it terrorists or such would be completely wrong. How if you try to make it less "silly" you will completely fail because while it is a bit silly it's crucial to making the plan work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically how they could most fuck it up and create the most crowd-pleasing ending. <br/> 
 <br/> 
About the only things I've seen of it so far are widely-known. The new costume publicity photos that went out a long time ago, the trailer that screened in front of Dark Knight, and some of the posters that I saw at the theater the other day. I'm avoiding prior knowledge because, well, I read the comic. What more do I need until reviews come in?

 <br/> 
SPOILER-BASED DISCUSSION LIES BEYOND! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Uniting against an outside threat, not a super-powered hero now totally disinterested in Earthly affairs, was essential. There's no way you can disturb that delicate peace by pointing out that it was all just a massive hoax designed to create peace. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus, well, rallying against Dr. Manhattan was already going on and the issue with heroes place in society is weirdly shifted into that ending in a strange new way. It's beyond stupid. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus, why even create the machine? I mean, he controls matter on a sub-atomic level. There is no need to replicate anything along those lines. It just doesn't work. Even worse, if he had the machine he could have used it to quietly eliminate his enemies instead of doing it normally. It negates the entire narrative.

      That would be the proper way to do it. I just don't see how you can do it well as a film. It's a fucking  <em>oral history</em> . Sure, it'll probably feature him trekking around to interview the people and then using flashbacks to show their stories with narration, but I'm not really behind that. It was a book. That was the chosen medium for the project because that is what suited it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
An audiobook would work, but it would be best done in the style of the notes and actual recordings of the stories that would be used to compile the book. In that context it still works.

      That is the book I am reading next. I haven't yet read it. San Francisco libraries are terrible. Branches are like bad school libraries. I mean, the sci-fi section for the Haight branch is a single side of a four or five shelf bookcase such as you probably have in your home. I have friends with larger and better personal collections of sci-fi. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You basically have to order everything from another branch or the main library and wait for them to ship it to your branch. It's rare that you'll find something good at a branch and they generally have very small collections. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suspect it's a mixture of the lack of space, terrible use of the space they have, and massive budget problems. I mean, in the suburbs you have people more willing to pump money into libraries, greater ability to just drive there, and more space. Plus you don't need to spend most of your budget on other crucial services so things like libraries aren't relegated to being cut to the bone all the damn time. But it does pale horribly to the libraries in the suburbs where I grew up. In some ways the college town I used to live in with a single library and a largely poor student population did a better job and had a better collection. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's just so random too. I mean, there was a Tomb Raider paperback there. The video section had stuff like single VHS copies of mid-series episodes of Lain and Evangelion next to Season 3 (and only Season 3) of The West Wing on DVD and Lord of the Rings on VHS. It feels like a lot of it is just poorly planned or randomly donated. They often don't have books and some stuff that you'd expect more of just isn't there or is in really small quantities (e.g. three copies of  <em>Burning Chrome</em>  for the entire city one is missing, one is library use only, and all are at Main). <br/> 
 <br/> 
For a major city and one with a population that seems to, by and large, care about such things it's pretty apalling. I guess a lot of people just buy books more often. I can certainly see why you'd be driven to.

      As long as they observe some of the basic physical rules of the zeds (slow moving, intelligence basically equivalent to an insect's, etc.) I'll be pretty forgiving. The world needs a new solid zombie movie director. Romero lost his way quite a while ago and all the kids today want these crazy sprinting ghouls.

      <em>28 Days Later</em>  was awesome, but I almost don't count it as a true zombie movie. I mean, "rage?" They're infected with  <em>"rage?"</em>  A monkey watched too much cable and so his body developed this stuff? What the fuck is that? <br/>

And let me say that the remake of  <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>  would have been  <em>perfect</em>  if not for that one glaring flaw which, in my eyes, almost tore the whole thing down.

      I didn't care for it and I'll agree it's not zombies. It's rabies. I felt the second half lost the thread way too much for me to enjoy it and, well, I just wasn't there to begin with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't even bother with the remake. I don't ever bother with remakes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you want the best current slow-moving zombie director today you want to go out and pick up the collections of  <em>The Walking Dead</em> . I was lucky enough to subscribe since #1 (and when I accidentally got a double of the fairly rare #2 I was able to sell the completely unopened copy online a few years ago for a nice profit that I sorely needed) and it's exactly what you want. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's in black-and-white as a stylistic choice and it follows the survivors more than the zombies. The author is not afraid to change things up and kill off major characters and unlike a lot of other comics here they're staying dead. He also chose not to disclose the reasons for the zombies because, well, does it ever make things better that way? You just get bogged down in reasoning and such and you never concentrate on the actual day-to-day stuff that matters. It just gives you a reason to say how it breaks the invisible rules. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously though, Robert Kirkman is the best zombie director working today. He's just working in comics instead of film.

Wow. You're not kidding. The prison is now over. It's been, like, years (in real-time, not in-world) since then. The story just went through a massive upheaval after a couple of overly long arcs and a few issues that tried to raise tension in order to build to a big finish and some world-changing (or at least, group-changing) events, but it felt a little slow and stalling when you're reading it monthly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Man, I've been so busy with moving and some other stuff that I've fallen even further behind with my comics than usual. I really need to devote some solid time to getting in some reading. Stupid novels taking up all my damn time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh and I have to recommend to everyone to read  <em>Stray Bullets</em> . It went on a lengthy hiatus with just one issue left to finish up the current arc which had been going on for, well, years and years because David Lapham would sometimes take a year and a half between issues, but now he's working on a new series and says he doesn't have the time or money to work on it for the near future. Still, it's a great, great amazingly wonderful series. I cannot foist enough love onto it.

      I didn't mind the social commentary.  <em>WWZ</em>  was packed with that, too. I mean, in any good story about global infestation there's got to be some of it. It would be sterile without it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for  <em>Left 4 Dead,</em>  I was really excited when I first heard about it (not that I have a compatible console on which to play it, or anything). Even after I found out that the zombies were fast I wanted to take a look. Then I did and found out that its offenses ran much, much deeper: super zombie bosses. NO. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Dead Rising</em>  seems pretty solid, though. Not that I've played it, either. But I've always thought that a game like  <em>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</em>  would be an excellent model for a zombie game. Huge levels, small party of playable characters (preferably without all the radars and night vision - probably using only, like, civilian hunting rifles, etc.) and just, like, thousands of shuffling zombies per level. No super zombies. No mutant bunny rabbits or any of that shit. I realize it'll never get made 'cause most people would find that extremely boring. Maybe for the PC? I hear those people like boring games.

      I thinking something closer to Stalker would be ideal for zombies. Large, open-world gameplay with the sort of shooter/RPG hybrid you get from games like System Shock and Deus Ex (not the watered-down crap we got with Bioshock). You wander around in the post-zombie world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And yeah. PC is often the way to go. Far less pandering to the twitchy masses than the consoles. Sadly the 360 is often killing the PC and getting studios and sequels to PC games watered-down and remade as console games that are merely ported to PC. It's a real problem.

      30 Rock and Always Sunny are both much better than The Office. It has its moment, but it's still inferior to the original and over-praised. <br/>

Whasshisname is a lot better as Dwight, but that's just about the only part. Steve Carell... just doesn't do it for me. I simply do not care for him or his take on the character. <br/>

      I agree with you on almost everything except The US Office not being funny. I own the full UK box set and find it funny, but British funny. I rarely laugh out loud at it but I love watching it. <br/>

      The very opposite opinion of my old dormmate, who thought the British version had belly laughs, while the US version just has a constant level of low humor that is still pretty good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Teh reason why I said that the Office is one of the greatest series for comedies isn't because it is the funnies .. .although it is very funny .. .but because it has a lot of pathos, too . ..but subtle pathos.  The more you know the characters, the more you identify with them, and the more you love them.  It never cheats pathos by having A Very Special Episode, or cheat comedy by making cheap pop culture references like Family Guy and The Simpsons.  It keeps it real.  And while the humor isn't often outrageous, it's genuine.   <br/> 
Arrested Development is different.  It has a lot less sympathy in it, and a lot more outrageous humor.  But this humor is well written, and challeges the viewer, and doesn't follow a formula either.

      That would never work.  I like the US version better because Michael Scott is much more goodhearted, it seems to me, than David Brent, who just seems like a cad.  Also, yes to your dark comment, and I think it's because as an American sitcom subject to the strict desires of the American viewing public, deeper plots and more complex personal relationships etc are needed, so it lends itself to that kind of whatever BLAHBLAHBLAH like the episode where Michael sleeps with the concierge (Clemmy from "Reno") in Toronto and then gets mad at the CEO guy (forget his name) for sending his girlfriend Holly away (non-Office viewers will be a bit confused; if so fuck you). <br/>

      Actually, that episode was one of the few where the bleakness never leaves.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Andy finds out Angela is cheating on him...but doesn't know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Michael, in all his naivety, gets it on with a pretty chick and just wants to spend the night with her...but doesn't, and takes it out on his boss. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even the exceptionally fucked up Christmas episode of this year (the Office's Christmas specials are especially sick and twisted) had a few glimmers of hope, but Andy, as always, drags everything to the "Dark Comedy" side. <br/>

      I find the deeper personal relationships to be more of a turn-off on the American version. It's too much of a drama in that regard and not really a comedy anymore. It's like the relationships  <strong>are</strong>  the plot and not in service to setting up comedy as they typically are on Arrested Development.

      Arrested Development and The Office (both branches) are both in the same style of occasionally deadpan, occasionally bizarre humor, but they work in different ways. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Arrested Development is more like a traditional sitcom, but I can understand how it got canceled so soon (I almost feel like if Ron Howard didn't spend all of Season 3 poking fun at non-watchers and the network by kind of saying "Look how fucking stupid you are for not watching this show from the beginning!" and actually kept the tone constant from the early episode with Charlize Theron it would have gotten picked up for a 4th season). That show just works better on DVD it seems like, whereas The Office allows for more emotional involvement that keeps you coming back week by week.

      That's the only concern I have with an AD movie, which we've all discussed before: will a 1.5 hour, or even 2 hour movie serve to tie up the loose ends of a story that, by hours, was more like 24 hours long?  Some plots, especially the overarching Iraq plot, were seasons-long.  The Office could resolve issues neatly in movie form, but AD lends itself to seasons of storytelling.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And now that I think about it, that just tells how the shows are different in their own way.  I feel The Office is more of a traditional sitcom as opposed to AD, because stories start and end more often and are more realistic, or traditional.

      I think AD is more a twist on the traditional sitcom, similar to  <em>It's Always Sunny</em>  and, to a greater extent,  <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>  than The Office. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that The Office COULD wrap up the series' plot in a special (similar to the UK version) but it wouldn't be satisfying. They have been setting up a lot of things from even season 1 that will start the end of that show. Andy's wedding will get the ball rolling, I believe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
AD has potential to work in movie form it just won't work very good and everyone will hate it. AD is not  <em>Firefly</em> , it didn't get cut down in its prime. It got to wrap up all of the plot it the final season, so there is no need to make a movie. I agree with Micheal Cera on that.

      The way I explained it to a friend is "it's manga drawn by a Canadian dude who's obsessed with video games and indie rock". <br/>

It's manga in style only. You read it how you would read a normal book and it doesn't have any of the conventions of a regular manga.

      No, it isn't. "Philippine" is also a legitimate adjective. I didn't want to use "Filipino", because it might been interpreted as indicating she had a little something extra under her skirt, and "Filipina" would have sounded redundant. <br/>

      I'm starting to understand the niche that you're carving out for yourself here, Wozzeck. The Constant Contrarian. That's cool. There needs to be one. I previously would've said that Belgand was already filling that role, but he's rounding himself out a little, lately. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I wasn't thrilled about it initially, but now that you've officially been completely correct in one of your relentless assertions (unlike the Raven Riley debacle up there) it lends you some cred. <br/>

      My wife now knows enough about Achewood to believe it's full of degenerates. She thought the strip of Nice Pete driving Philippe in the van looked like me and her. She has a phobia of driving over bridges, and she thought Pete was looking very reassuringly at Philippe, while driving over a bridge. <br/> 
 (That's the arc where Philippe runs down a deer in his escape-panic and Pete shoots it to put it out of its misery.) A great back arc, that one. <br/>

      Exactly. Phillipe thinks that Nice Pete is there, with a gun, and he points it at him with the intent to shoot him. *Cliffhanger!* Next strip the silhouette is shown to be more obviously Ray (the hood has caused him to look more like Nice Pete) and then Ray actually appears and shoots not Phillipe, but the deer to put it out of its misery. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is Ray. Nice Pete is not there at any time. That was an illusion in the mind of a scared little otter. The narrator in the previous panel (Phillipe) is unreliable due to fear. We are seeing things from his perspective. In the second strip Beef is there and is providing an outside perspective that confirms the scenario as it actually occurs.

      I'm not disputing that Ray shows up seconds after the shoot. I'm saying Ray did not do the shoot. Onstad would not have screwed that up. <br/> 
 You did. <br/> 
Twice he makes it obvious that Ray is left-handed, but in the previous panel the shooter is right-handed. He doesn't even put comic smoke issuing from Ray's gun barrel. Also the barrel is different. <br/>

      It's quite possible that Chris made a mistake, you realize that right? <br/> 
 <br/> 
The silhouette was obviously designed to throw readers off the scent that it was Ray who shot the deer. If not, why would Ray appear and not Nice Pete? It does not make sense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for right-hand versus left-hand, this goes to the "Onstad made a mistake and tried to correct it" argument. Notice how in the next strip Ray is clutching the gun with both hands, making it possibly ambiguous as to what hand he was shooting from in retrospect. Why else would one strip end in silhouette and the other BEGIN with one that is supposed to be the same one.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is ridiculous, I seriously can't believe I'm having an argument on the internet over which cartoon cat shot a cartoon deer.

      Well, you are the one who is making it into an argument. <br/> 
 <br/> 
An argument that seems to be saying, we can't go by what we are seeing.  We can only get the correct answer when we  <em>go against</em>  what we are seeing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah, that makes tons of sense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
[imghttps://members.cox.net/temporare/ear_shooter.JPG[/img] <br/> 
 <br/> 
So you are saying we have suddenly been shifted to Philippe's POV just for that one panel?  And the fact that the silhouette is Nice Pete's silhouette is just Philippe's panic distorting the image? <br/> 
 <br/> 
OK, I guess there is some continuity to that argument.  And I don't have time right now to take a trip through the archives to see if Onstad has used that POV technique earlier. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But it doesn't seem likely to me.  I will gladly retract my statement if such can be shown to be the case. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But going by the evidence, Nice Pete took the shot.  You can even see his sideburns in the silhouette.

      I just don't think it makes any sense from a story-telling point of view that Nice Pete is standing there, pointing a gun, and then Ray is there holding a gun.  What happened?  Pete is going to kill Philippe, and then Ray magically takes his place, and happens to be holding a gun too?  Did ray knock out Pete and take his gun away from him?  And if so, why didn't Onstad make that a little more clear?  that would be some good storytelling we missed out there. <br/> 
The biggest concession I'll make is that Onstad changed his mind between strips.  However I doubt even that is likely.  Scared, unreliable Philippe is the best answer to this problem.

      The entire strip is from Phillipe's point of view, he is talking to himself, we hear his thoughts, he is alone and he is scared and then he sees what looks a lot like Nice Pete pointing a gun at him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was a fake-out for storytelling purposes. The second strip completely reveals the truth and the arc ends. It was the dramatic, penultimate cliffhanger where we think that Phillipe is going to be shot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In all likelihood Nice Pete was really just taking him to a super-secret ice cream parlor and the whole scenario seemed pretty scary to the little otter (and, well, Nice Pete is pretty creepy and scary) and everyone else freaked out over it because of Pete being, well, Pete. He likely never intended to harm Phillipe. I mean, look at the place, it is obviously just an old, creepy, run-down ice cream shop. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nice Pete was trying to be nice, but the little otter was so scared that he assumed he was out to kill him thus causing the mistaken identity.

      I am not saying you are wrong.  Not at all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But out of the nine panels in the strip, we see Philippe from the outside in five.  So, yeah, you can say it is his point of view, but not the same point of view inside his head as in the final panel.  Especially since what we are seeing is a distorted view of reality. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Again, I am not arguing against your position.  I am merely pointing out how Onstad has caught me by surprise with this.  I want it to be presented much more clearly when I am seeing distorted reality through a character's eyes, and not seeing actual reality from the narrator's godlike POV.

      I see your point, but the final panel was literally from Phillipe's POV. That was implicit in the staging of the shot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm certain I've seen this technique in film many times before without it leading to any confusion, but then again they rarely have the option of providing greater, misleading detail there and then changing it in the next shot. It's usually just more obviously ambiguous.

      HOLY GOD.   <br/> 
I think it's pretty obvious that pointy ears is what Philippe  <em>sees</em>  the shooter as.  That explains why he is right handed too.  The second strip shows reality, which is Ray.  That is why Ray is still holding the gun.  That is what makes the most sense.  Onstad was trying to create the most suspense. <br/>

      No. I can appreciate the ambiguity, if that's the way Onstad intended it.  <br/> 
 If he's not dotting 'i's and crossing 't's to everyone's complete satisfaction, my version has the well-intentioned serial killer taking the boy out to a special place for a Halloween icecream and nothing more. The ensuing circumstances were all Philippe's doing. <br/>

      Yeah, I don't think Nice Pete ever meant to hurt Philippe.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And as for the "shooter" controversy, I think it was just an artistic device to make us think it was Nice Pete. We're all, like, "Oh, no! He caught up with him! What'll happen now?" but then we realize that it was just Ray. Onstad did a really good job of conveying that Philippe also thought this, even though he couldn't make out the shooter's features at first. His terrified little mind just filled in the blanks and that's what we saw at first, too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Everybody happy? I'm gonna guess no.

Crap.  I don't want to do that.  I have been doing it this one way for years, and over 1500 strips. <br/>

No resolution of this is going to make me happy.  Unless Onstad himself comes and makes a clarification. <br/>

      I came home from work one day in 1987 and my wife was climbing the walls, hysterical about a guy wearing a Cox outfit with a ladder who came to the door. She had looked out at him coming up and saw these dead eyes, and locked the door. <br/> 
 He jiggles the handle after ringing the bell and knocking a couple times. Goes around to the side, which she has locked, then finally leaves. He'd probably seen my 2 yr old daughter waving at him. <br/> 
 My wife was literally babbling. Something wrong about this guy, his van didn't have the sign painted on it, all her alarms were going off.  <br/> 
 The next day or 2 later we read about Jo Talley Cooper, who lived about 2-3 blocks away from us. My wife again goes apeshit babbling. I asked her if she wanted to talk to the cops about it. I forget why she said no. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When we read about the guy getting DNA I.D.'d for it  years later, she was sure it was the same guy. <br/>

      I never have cable people show up in company vans or wearing uniforms. They all seem to be independent contractors or something. Frankly the last time I didn't even want the guy here. All I needed was my service transferred. I can plug it in myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The time before that they tried to charge me for coming out to fix a problem that happened on the line (on the pole, it's not even like I have a yard or something where I could have conceivably done anything to it) and was clearly their fault and not in any possible way mine. Actually, they automatically put "service protection" on my account and then pro-rated it and charged me from that date. There is no fucking way I'm paying for a service call when it's your half-assed equipment that goes down and I have to be the one to let you know and wait for the guy to come fix it.

      Weirdly, most of the concrete memories I have of 1981 were all major events of the time. I remember hearing that some non-American country was letting some American people go after keeping them for a while. Didn't care about that. I remember hearing that the president got shot. Didn't care about that. I remember with crystal clarity when the baseball season was temporarily suspended because of a strike. I didn't know what a strike was, but it broke my heart. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My only vivid personal memories of the time revolve around the enormous wall next to our house in Jefferson City, MO. I remember the guys with guns sitting in little houses up on top of that wall at all times. They would wave to me sometimes. My dad lived on the other side of the wall. We would go see him sometimes.

But yeah, not only is it a sourcebook but you have to do a lot of research just to get some of the deeper references, like who Big Brother REALLY is and why it's so funny Moore used that character. <br/>

But I giggled a little when Mina mentioned that Bond didn't bat an eye at a female character named Oodles O'Quimm,  <em>as if he's encountered someone with such a weird name before</em> .

      It's a bit more psycho-sexual than just that though. All looking at how the stories are shaped by young girl's sexual awakenings and such. <br/>

I mean, yeah, there is hell of just out-and-out porno fucking going on, but it  <em>does</em>  have a point to it and the characters are actually thought out and such. <br/>

I would call it decidedly less insane than latter-period Heinlein's sex obsessed writings. Of course, his frequent divergences into incest and paedophilia there were... well, kinda creepy really.

      Ok first impressions...  I wish the invisible man's powers were more clearly defined.  You'd think in a city as grimy as late 19th century London, he would end up covered in dirt, and it's impressive how easily paint washes off him.  It's all very well to say he imbued his body with the refractive/reflective properties of air, but how does he stop stuff from sticking to him?  And does that apply to sweat or other excretions?

      Most of the methods of killing vmapries simply involve decapitation, destruction of the heart (both filled with plenty of symbolism as well as a pretty good way to be sure most things are dead), and many things that are common symbols of purity, e.g. sunlight, running water, silver, garlic, fire, and holy water. Not being capture in a mirror speaks to the idea that they are supposedly without a soul. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is all really basic sort of stuff and pretty typical of most folklore. The vampire is a creature of evil that preys on the essence of the living to sustain itself. The symbolism is almost as strong as werewolves which are basically just a huge metaphor about "the uncontrollable beast inside" matched up with the idea of "full moon madness".

      Nah... when you go to that level (as much as we often desire to do so) you end up making rules that will then inhibit future storytelling. You have to find clever ways to explain it away with nonsense and such and you have fanboys like me buying the TNG Tech Manual and talking about how they failed to follow proper procedure for a core breach (i.e. eject the core into space) in  <em>Generations</em> . <br/>

      Here's Onstad's description of his real-life experience the day before this strip was posted, from an interview  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100420005340/https://www.viceland.com/int/guide_comics/htdocs/this-dude-no-mercy-107.php">VICE</a> .  I know I posted this quote on a later strip, but I thought it would be most appropriate to have it here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>This last Christmas my family and I were in the middle of moving out of Silicon Valley, and our dryer broke. We had to hit a laundromat on the 23rd of December, with our little three-year-old girl, in this wealthy town where we lived. Our life was in a big state of flux and uncertainty, and I was hugely depressed, and it was a %u201Cthere but for the grace of God go I%u201D moment. All my daughter wanted to do was dance and look at herself in the big reflective front windows on the darkened street, and I felt like an utter failure as a father, standing there among the machines, even though this beautiful child saw nothing other than the big expanse of white tiles where she could dance in her new red shoes.</em></div>
