      Yesterday's positive feedback led to a 20% increase on the size and prominence of the bulge in the unitard, leading to much more visibility by the readers. Now, if you'll turn to page 20 on the briefings I have given you, you'll see how when under extreme magnification the bulge actually is a cleverly hidden subliminal advertisement for Tall Hot Brutes, the brand that as such... and thus we can expect profits of...

      My father met Jack Nicholson in a bar once. He asked my dad if he wanted an autograph. He declined, so Jack said "Okay. I'll buy you a beer." <br/>

Later, my dad told me that Jack Nicholson doing an impersonation of himself was worse than other people doing an impersonation of him. It was a Charlie Chaplin paradox for me.

      Dang, Todd.  T-bag ain't just doing impersonations up there.  He's doing  <em>impressions</em> .  He's getting right at the heart of these figures. <br/>

The essence of Martha Stuart is a deliciously sad shower aria sung with cradled breasts.  The essence of Jack Nicholson is beating down a squirrel in a necktie to express his passion for a 25-year old punk band.

      I think it is in the tone. Too many negative comments amount to "This sucks," or (and I quote,) "another AWFUL AWFUL strip."  That gets tiresome, and out come the lames.  Frankly the many comments that say little more than "Awesome" or "Do you guys remember that one line from panel three?  How funny was that?" are a bit tiresome too.  But they match the generally friendly, wisecracking tone of the place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I think it helps to predict that your comment will be lamed away.  This often provokes the opposite reaction.  Alternately, taking the time to include an animated gif of breasts with would probably reduce any comment's lame count.

      i predicted the lames, and the lames, they came anyway.  What can you do?  I think it's perfectly acceptable to not find every single achewood totally faultless.  It is definitely unfortunate that negative comments aren't allowed on here- just because I don't fawn over every strip doesn't mean I am any less of a fan.

I've railed against certain kinds of negative comments in the past*, but have decided not to give out any more lames.  It's more fun to run out of chubbies, I figure. <br/>

      A brave and pacific stance! But with some of these overly aggressive jock types who've found their way here I don't know how you can resist. I am inspired, and I will try to lame less, but I can't put it down completely. It's too well deserved on some occasions. My resolution: I'll save lames for mean-spirited comments only and leave bad jokes alone. I feel better already.
