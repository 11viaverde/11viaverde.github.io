      Do all Canucks hate Seinfeld, or are you your own man? What I guess I mean is - do you  <em>have</em>  to say you hate it, like the French, or do you, yourself, honestly find it to be bad? <br/>

      I'm uncomfortable with how you sort of compared  <em>Seinfeld</em>  to  <em>Friends,</em>  there. Maybe only Americans can know the difference. <br/>

      I would tend more toward a "Shit and Gold" comparison, but I'm starting to get the idea that I may be the only  <em>Seinfeld</em>  fan here, so I understand if no one agrees. Really, regardless of how anyone feels about that show, I would at least hope that the sort of people who enjoy this comic could all agree that  <em>Friends</em>  is maybe the worst shit ever. I would hope for that.

      I think its a matter of taste, like with wine, some people spend so much time tasting the really fine stuff that they think the cheap kind sucks, I like the kind that comes in a box. When I first started reading achwood i kinda didn't get it, but then you start to realize that it has layers upon layers of things that go beyond most other creations in any form of entertainment. To those people who love expensive wines that to me taste weird and harsh, me prefering the basic slightly sweet taste of box wine probably looks the same way as people who just want flat plain clearly delivered jokes like you see in friends when they could have this complex and yet subtle mix of artistic nuanced humor look to us.

      I like it, but it's basically because I have watched it since I was fairly small while they were actually coming out on air, and I grew up with the characters, almost like an extended family in a strange way. I can understand that it is not even vaguely intellectually stimulating, the plot lines are generally awful, the acting can be wooden and all the rest of it, but to be truthful about it: I used to want to live my life exactly like that, with 5 friends in two apartments in New York, because I am from England, grew up in the 90s and it seemed glamorous and fascinating as a teenager to live in a situation like that. Call me small-town and naive, but I'm not going to apologise for liking Friends, in the same way you don't apologise for liking an alcoholic uncle who tells you stupid stories. In the end there is always a lovable factor to them. <br/> 
I'm not trying to convert the cynics (there's a lot to be cynical about, I know), just be aware that for a lot of us 90s teenagers, Friends was the epitome of dream living, and yes, I am aware of how sad that is. In a few years I probably won't appreciate Friends like I do, who knows. <br/> 
They were my ridiculously wooden, studio audience, throwaway prime-time role models.

      Almost everyone who hates Friends ends up liking it after they watch a couple of episodes simply because it was an  <em>extremely efficient programme</em> <br/>

      Two freshmen are watching movie trailers on a laptop. They ask "if it's cool" to share the blanket one is laying under. It is cool. They "accidentally" move closer to each other, laughing a bit too loud at the antics on the computer screen. After a while, they end up in the "spoon position" and nervously start dry-humping until the "top" reaches orgasm. They do NOT discuss this afterwards, and a week later ask someone at housing if they can change roomates.

      It doesn't seem that anyone has mentioned where "spooning" got its name from. It refers to two people huddling up right next to each other, facing the same direction, with their slightly knees bent. They fit together in the same way that stacked spoons do. So spooning is like an awkard full-body hug, & usually prelude to dry humping and premature ejaculation. Or so I would imagine.

As it is, I thought it might be an actual quote from Alan Davies.  <br/> 
He got into trouble recently for biting a homeless person's ear after that person called him "Jonathon Creek", so he may not be entirely happy with his lot in life

      Mr McElfatrick said that he yelled %u201CJonathan Creek%u201D at Mr Davies, which angered him. He said: %u201CI thought he was going to whisper something but his face darkened and he almost spat the words, %u2018My name%u2019s Alan. You know my name %u2013 Alan. What%u2019s my name? It%u2019s Alan.%u2019 Then he suddenly went for my left ear. It was incredibly painful. I shrieked and my eyes were watering. He hung on and drew blood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
%u201CI%u2019ve seen Alan on TV and he seems so mild mannered. He%u2019s a bit of a mummy%u2019s boy really with his sheepish grin and silly jokes. So when I felt his teeth around my ear I just couldn%u2019t believe it. I was shaking with shock afterwards. You%u2019d think an educated millionaire like him would have more decency.%u201D  <br/>

      It was funny, up until they all started fucking each other. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like the time Joey came into some money and bought new furniture. On his new chair was a bright red faux-fur pillow, and I think it was Rachael who asked "Is that genuine Muppet skin?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
The show jumped the shark the moment each episode revolved around who was fucking who and whether or not girl A would get back together with guy B.

      I believe I have pinpointed the shark-jumping moment. <br/> 
"I, Ross, take thee Rachel"... <br/> 
Then on, you knew EXACTLY how everything would pan out. No plot after that. They could have wrapped it up in one more season, instead they dragged it out for SIX more increasingly dull and badly-written seasons that irredeemably tarnished the show's reputation. The  only thing that kept it going was Schwimmer, who's such a good clown he could make even the writing in the last three seasons seem sporadically funny. <br/> 
Anyway, I like to think this joke wouldn't have been made if the show had finished in the mid-90s, as it should have.

      I hate to point out that this is anachronistic. Friends was around way before Shrek came out. Not that this makes it suck any less.

      Ya but I don't know about where you lived, but where I lived I'm pretty sure since it first came out it was ALWAYS on some channel as a rerun.  I mean for real, no matter when you turned on the TV, it was on.  This also happened with Scrubs for a couple years.  And Everyone Loves Ray.  Jesus, TV really sucks.  It's not really TV, it's just a Friends/Scrubs/Everyone Loves Ray machine.

      Friends is funny. It's certainly watchable as long as you clamp a pillow over your face whenever it gets too bogged down by the twisted mesh of character relationships.

      It is pretty easy to write some Friends-style material. It was a thing I was doing yesterday to amuse my fiancee who is about 10,000 miles away.

      At one point, I had stopped hating Friends. Not that I started watching or enjoying the show, I just deemed it impractical. It's mass appeal justifies it's existence, for better or worse, and I can always be doing something else besides watching television. Mediocrity always rises to the top, after all. <br/> 
Then the DVDs came out. <br/> 
The damn show is on around the clock at least six hours out of the day, and people still pay upwards of three hundred dollars to see this show? Am I alone here, or is this actually something to lose faith in humanity for?
