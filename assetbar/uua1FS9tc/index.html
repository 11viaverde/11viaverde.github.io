      It says that you're kind of a jerk to be unnecessarily hatin'.  As I've said elsewhere we tend to get nicer yanks on these here boards and everyone here more or less has earned the right to be judged on their own merits just for being here, in my humblest of humbles. <br/>

About half the people here are assholes but the other half are mostly really nice.  There's no point in pissing on the generally nice ones for no real reason, is all I'm saying.

 <br/> 
You enter the dungeon. The flickering torches in sconces on the walls barely illuminate the slime-covered rough-hewn stones making up the walls and floors. The ceiling is too high for you to see clearly, but there appears to be something hanging from it. The smell of decay and brimstone stings your nostrils and makes your mouth water. You hear running water from far away. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In front of you is a soticoto. <br/>

You hit the soticoto for 498 damage! <br/>

The soticoto drops to the ground dead. <br/>

      There is a pretty low infidelity-related joke I was about to make involving a homonym of "coming" but I did not make it.  I feel like this should be shared for some reason.  I don't know, maybe somebody else can figure out how this bullshit world is supposed to work.

seriously, there are jerks on both sides here. The only reason we have more is because we are a larger country, therefore more people live here. If you look at it per-capita, it's probably about even. In fact, it's spread pretty even throughout the world. Case in point: look at how many countries have their own editions of Big Brother.

I was talking about racism. not overgeneralizing. "Mexican" is a nationality, there is no ethnic consistantcy to people that are citezens of any American (as in north, central, and south) nation. calling someone a nationality becuase they have brown skin is not generalizing it's blurring the lines of ethnicity, language and nationality. with the implication that when someone appears to have native american ancestory they must be poor, starving, stupid, and not a legitimate citizen. but some kind of 'second class' citizen or foreigner. and the thought you are now thinking that "but it's so often true" thought that is racism. north americans don't think of other people as people first. they think of them in terms of economic class, race, and clothing options first.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
and yes I am a US citizen but I don't see why that is important to my opinon of every American I've ever meet.... <br/> 
 <br/> 
also. I made one little tangent QQing post. sorry. lol it had no place here. but your still a dick. and the OP from thegrapist is still hateful bullshit. not that I think it's unique in anyway to him or the US. it seems to be a part of the universal human experince.

      Large portions of the United States are overwhelmingly racist.  Large portions are not.  Every United States citizen you've ever met (hyperbole or no) is not every United States citizen.  As it happens, ninety-nine out of a hundred people I've encountered and discussed race with in my part of the states hate the kind of imperialist racism you describe.  Sir, they like it about as much as fish like parasailing.  And that's a fact.  As a wise man once said: if that makes me a dick, then at the very least acknowledge my balls.

      Asking you to acknowledge that one large country could have regionally and individually different attitudes towards race doesn't constitute, as you say, "stroking my epeen."  America's a big country to be making these kinds of generalizations about, and I merely suggested that you calm down instead of potentially insulting a few decent people.  Christ, man, it's only fair. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The OP was revolting, it's true: I don't think anyone would really disagree with you (hence the humor of zefiel's reply).  Escalating the conversation to further insults from there instead of ignoring the comment and moving on isn't mature or productive, though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Insulting ME for pointing out that not everyone in this danged country is racist...well, that's just silly.

      Yeah, I was trying to suss that one out. For a bit there I was operating under the hypothesis that Lesotho was both a fairly obscure Aftican nation (obscure to an American, anyway) and a regional So Cal snackfood what compliments tacos and Dr. Pepper. This hypothesis failed even the most superficial scrutiny. The wheel of psuedoscience takes another shuddering turn.

      Here (Mexico) the usual fare is 3 tacos for a dollar. Cow cheek, tongue, guts, udder, whatever you want. There's also pork, which usually includes a little slice of pineapple that the  <em>Taquero</em>  will deftly cut into the air and catch with your taco.

      YES! Why is the U.S. apparently the only country subjected to fucking gross high fructose corn syrup Coke? I don't know about the Mexican ingredients, but European Coke is all sugar-sweetened. Also, apparently, you can also get sugar-sweetened Coke in the U.S. during Passover, because observant Jews can't consume corn products during that time. Here's a feed on the matter:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101008201556/https://buzzfeed.com/buzz/Sweet_Sweet_Passover_Coke">https://buzzfeed.com/buzz/Sweet_Sweet_Passover_Coke</a>

      Welcome to the grammar rodeo, folks. Saddle up for some boring tirades! (I guess it's not too fair to single this one example out. But come on, people! This is the goddamned internet! Minor grammatical transgressions are really the last thing we should be freaking out over. Yes, that sentence has a plural subject and a singular verb conjugation, and yes, I ended it with a preposition. SUCK IT.

      I don't think there's a lame mafia. I think there are just a lot of people reading this now, and many of them (five, as I write this) found it lame. Look at how many different users have commented on this page alone. Surely five of them can have independently come to the conclusion that the comment sucked. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I  <em>almost</em>  marked it lame, and then thought better of it, but I'm not part of an Evil Conspiracy. I'm sure other people had the same thought and then failed to change their mind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As far as the obliteration goes, you can prevent that from happening by setting your hide threshold at the top of the page, right under the comic. Mine is at 9999, so comments are never hidden. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And if a comment does get hidden somehow, you can still read it by clicking the word "comment" in the message "A comment by somebody was marked lame too many times and exlcuded." This works with spam, too: No comments are ever actually deleted.

      Sometimes I have fantasies about what combinations I would make if I owned a tex mex franchise. My favorite is the 'six shooter', six bean burritos all wrapped up in a cardboard box a la the happy meal. You simply can't go wrong with a fat case of burritos.

      I don't necessarily fantasize about mexican food, but large food in general. <br/>

One of my ideas is about 4-5 yukon gold potatoes, with seasoning, wrapped in a New York strip steak.  The steak is then tied off at one end and placed vertically on the plate to create The Mortar Shell.

      The cardboard box actually has to be an oversize revolver, or maybe just the cylinder, with each burrito loaded and ready to fire. I would definitely buy such a thing. <br/>

      No, I think he's mad because Ray spent that much on him, and Beef will likely never be able to do the same for Ray. Or himself, for that matter. Basically, he's grateful, but his pride is wounded also, so he gives into the baser impulse to protect his pride rather than express gratitude.

      Nobody ever says 'this was my first Achewood' anymore, well it was. I was horribly confused, these cats just don't make much sense if you're not acclimatized to their speech patterns. So I went back to the start, and was a captive of the archives from 'because of a problem?' untill I finish the comics that have been made since this one.

      A really good Mexican taco... across the border will run you somewhere in the vicinity of $1 to $1.50 - and those are good stuff. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In San Diego, a burrito, with a higher price so as to make gringos more comfortable about what they're eating, will run you anywhere from 4 to 6 bucks. But northern of San Diego... I'd be weary of your Mexican food... you have to really hunt for it to either be GOOD/TASTY and or COLON-SAFE. <br/>

I AM from Mexico originally, consider my words LAW.
