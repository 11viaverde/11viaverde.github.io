      Chubbied, as I am in the middle of reading Only Revolutions. Trying to read, anyway. As I'm reading, the right side of my brain is yelling at the left side to start enjoying this, while the left side is calling the right one a pretentious cocksucker. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I am one of the biggest Dr. Manflesh fans out there, but this is getting old. Will it become funnier as he does this to the next five strips as well, or will it become gradually un-funnier? Discuss.

      I think it would be funnier if he changed to a different fanfic. You know, mix it up a little. But I think the important thing is this: Manflesh doesn't care whether anyone finds it funny or not. He's not doing this for the glory, the infamy or even the chubbies. The man is on a Mission.

      I usually try to, but sometimes when a thought comes to mind I don't feel like scanning through all six hundred comments to make sure it's 100 percent original. Besides, this entire board could be replaced by a perpetual flow of this image and be more worthwhile in the end. Wait, now that I investigate a bit I see that you are either a very thoughtful troll or an annoyingly over-opinionated neophyte. Either way, and with all due respect (if, in fact, any is due), calm yourself. There are far more grievous offenses to watchdog on this board.

      And thus, the cycle of Onstand is complete, expressing his hubris via an almost Oediopain prophecy, onto the jagged expressionist shores of a lonely island of html. Truly, this is the core of man. The admission of pornographic dependency amidst a sea of lonely desperation, denotes the greatness of a man thus emasculated, and bent upon an unholy pornographic conundrum. Should you grok the human experience contained herein, you should surely consider yourself enlightened and embittered both, for the jewels of the day are fair, but the jewels of the evening are fairer still. <br/>

      That was back when their albums had boss music on them, too. <br/>

Instead of DRM that would not let me play the CD in any CD player, except my old crappy Discman.

      I remember buying  <em>Ritual de lo Habitual</em>  in college.  When the album was first released, there were two versions of the cover art: the naughty version and a plain white cover imprinted with the text of the First Amendment.  Not wanting to oppress the band or deny it's creative freedom, I felt compelled to buy disc with the three sculptures.  And besides, I was in a hip and open-minded independent record store, and the staff there would surely think me a hypocrite if I chose the 1st Amendment cover and thus rejected the pornocover.  I proudly walked up to the cashier and presented my selection.  She glared at me with a piercing stare that said, " <em>Pervert!  You know very well that this is available with a respectable cover.</em> "  That glare haunts me to this day.

The rest of the movie is a montage of songs from these 2 albums and a melancholy love tale of Perry & his supposed late wife.  There's even a live performance of "Don't call me N****, Whitey" guest-starring Ice T, if I recall, but it's been about 15 years since I last saw it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The kicker?  The movie has only ever been available on VHS.  However, this is the antithesis of irony, considering the nostalgia theme of the above-featured strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Happy Amazon/E-bay hunting!

      It would seem that Mr. Onstad made a new year's resolution to tell us more about teodor's past, and to do so in color; if not, he's got a funny way of showing it.  does that fact that "pass it on" is in reverse mean that we are, in fact, supposed to do the opposite of pass it on?  are we supposed to keep marlene's actions a secret?

      I've never really understood the purpose of the Jolly Roger. Why would pirates want to alert their victims to their impending doom? Surely it would make more sense to lure in their prey by flying a flag emblazoned with the words "Fire Sale" or "Whore Ship: Massive Discounts"

      Actually, they sorta did.  They'd tail a ship for a while, deduce whether it was worth plunderin', all the while flying an allied flag to it.  Then at the last second, oh shit!  Up comes the Roger! Fuck me, they're pirates, everybody get ready, shit shit SHIT!  But the pirates'd already be ready to board, then jump on and hopefully scare the crap outta them with shock and awe tactics that the other crew'd give up without a fight.   <br/> 
They even had wee little hand grenades - those little black round ones you see on cartoons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There ya go.  "Whore Ship: Massive Discounts" would be a better choice, though, you're right.

      Achewood is correct. This conversation is asinine and all parties share equal amounts of the blame for it. I don't think that poster is a sock puppet, I think the strip itself temporarily gained sentience in order to put a stop to this jackassery, and we would do well to heed it because there are few things more boring on the internet than what we're looking at here.

      It would not be wrong to compliment you for having a good sense of humor, so why is it an affront to compliment you for being attractive? Your looks are element of yourself (and one that you intentionally put on display on the internet), and to compliment them is a completely valid thing to do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Someone telling you they think you're cute is not someone saying that your cuteness is the most important thing about you. It's just something they noticed about you, and something that most people are happy to hear about themselves. If someone you knew told you they liked your shirt, would you act like they'd implied that your taste in clothes is your defining aspect? I'm guessing not.

      I for one am glad he asked if that was you, and glad you answered, and here's why: <br/> 
 <br/> 
a) I think people have a natural curiosity about what people they communicate with look like.  This curiosity is enhanced in this case because your avatar might actually be a photo of you, in a way that a panda driving a go-kart that assetbar assigned at random is not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2)  It's fun to contemplate that there are interesting, attractive people around that share at least one (albeit trivial) common interest. <br/> 
 <br/> 
c)  That was a pretty choice rant.

      h: Many of us subconsciously judge others by their looks, even those of us who know better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
%u062E :Except sometimes you really can tell what someone is like from how they look, or rather from how they tend to hold their facial muscles. <br/>

      Maybe, to a point.  Would explain why he's planning "Holy Terror, Batman!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I also feel a part of it is the fact that he sees Batman as more of a pyschopath than most people would.    Which is a fair enough call, but I still don't like how he plays it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Except Dark Knight Returns.  That was brilliant.  I'm petitioning that to be taught in high school. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't really like Ronin either.  It left me kinda....whelmed.  It was alright, but also not.  It did influence Samurai Jack though, so that's a good thing. <br/>

At least ASB&R has Jim Lee doing the art.  The amount of eyegasms that man has given me, I tell ya.

      Yeah, Miller seems to really get off on Batman getting off on knocking heads. It wouldn't surprise me if, some day, he showed Batman sporting wood while gutting the Joker with the business end of a Batarang. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jim Lee represents everything I dislike about mainstream comics, but I'm with you on Samurai Jack. I think I would have loved Ronin if I'd read it when I was about 14, which is probably why I found it so embarrassing at 21. But, for DKR and Sin City, Miller will always be a hero.

      I can understand the dislike of Jim Lee.  It's a very 90's style, when technology and printing and colouring got better, everything becoming crisp and clean and somewhat manufactured.  But I personally enjoy that.  All I want is an artist who can convey emotions, darkness and action well.  While Jim Lee's action is lacking at times in my opinion, it all looks so damned good I'm willing to accept it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Artists I can't stand - Miller himself (the art's too dirty and bubbly and annoying.  I'll accept it for Sin City and DKR*, though.), Greg Land (oh oh OH he irrits me.  I'm not buying a comic for porn, let alone for horribly conveyed action.  And the man's a hack - look him up if you don't believe me.), Alex Ross, Simone Bianchi (both for lifeless photorealistic paintings - good for covers, but I don't like it in comics).  That's about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*I realise DKR was Lynn Varley.  But unless they're clones of one another, his style clearly influenced hers - most likely due to him being the writer.  See his Wolverine and Daredevil stuff.

      Well spotted, good sir.  The style makes much more sense, now. <br/>

I believe they got married after that, but I could be wrong.  They got divorced in 2005, though.  Given that women in his comics are always one of 4 tropes... <br/> 
A. Strippers <br/> 
B. Whores <br/> 
C. Sluts <br/> 
D. Dead <br/>

...I'm surprised  <em>any</em>  woman would marry him.  But people aren't bothered by sexual objectification as much as they used to be.  And hell, they may have had completely different issues between each other.

      Ok, listen, I used to read "Checkerboard Nightmare" Even worse, I used to enjoy it. Woe is me, I know. And that word has just reminded me of a certain parody/homage Kris Straub did of Eric Burns' style. Bearing that in mind: <br/>

      I think the ratings system is to express not only how hot the ladies are, but also how naked.  As the body here is mostly submerged in what is purportedly cream, hence the 2 rating.

      Unless he gets off on mod fellas on scooters or standing in alleyways, I don't think he was judging  <em>Quadrophenia</em>  on "hotness".  Perhaps it overruled the Hotness purely on being solid.  The means of measurement may have gotten complicated.

      Well, obviously I am just projecting my own feelings into this but: <br/> 
 <br/> 
I see it as a metaphor for constant dissatisfaction and a sense of waiting for something to come along and change your life and bring you peace of mind. Constantly checking your e-mail, not sure what you're waiting for, or who you expect to be writing to you, but hoping it will be there, the magic answer, the perfect solution, that e-mail that you will read, nod, and at last be able to close the window, turn off your computer, close your laptop with a satisfying "click", and walk away, satisfied at last, able to live your life now that you have finally reached what you have been waiting for your whole life. Enabling you to let go of all the things that went before, the crippling past, memories of times when you were not yet aware of this feeling, and then dreadful moments which continue to haunt you still. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And it's a habit I have had all my life. I couldn't walk past the mailbox without opening it to see if something had come -- and even when it did come, it never was what I was hoping for -- and I could never say what exactly I hoped it would contain. Now as an adult, I still go on waiting for that perfect e-mail. When I see the little red stamp appear on my Mail icon (yeah, Mac user), my heart leaps. But no matter how great the e-mail, it's still not the one which will liberate me. And as I read this strip, I felt that it was in fact my whole life which worked this way, waiting for that moment of enlightenment brought by... something. Liberation from this waiting for... something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And Teodor is just the kind of person to have that kind of anxiety, of wanting the solution to come from somewhere else (the right clothes or food or gadgets or girls) rather than from within himself. I've always favoured Roast Beef, but I'm starting to think my own neurosis (what is the plural of neurosis?) lay with Teodor rather than Beef. <br/> <br/> <br/> I think too much.

      an ex of mine became obsessed with finding that album. driving all over town, from goodwill to thrift store to record store looking for "that roxy music album, you know, with the boobs." he would whisper 'boobs' to the dude at the record store counter, to which the employee usually shout something about 'country life' and 'titties' which made me laugh, and him turn beet red. he would live the rest of the day embarrassed and pissed off.

      Well, I figured that as soon I was enlarging avatars I might as well give out the rest of my ration, knowing full well that I would probably end up wanting when all was said and done.  When that became the case, I started going to particularly great commenter's profiles and doling out some chubbies on their previous comments.  It's just my little way.

      As a barely teenage lad, I was quite taken by the Blind Faith album cover. There were not a few albums with naked grown women one them, but a girl my own age...! It was a unique kind of excitement. Needless to say, I bought the album, and it marked the beginning of a maturation in my musical tastes. Maturation out of adolescence was (as it is generally known) not nearly as smooth, unfortunately. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, I kind of wonder why they chose this as an image.. with a shiny phallic airplane, no less. You wouldn't be able to do that today. Jock Sturges catches shit all the time for his work. <br/>

      I was wondering about this too.  Upon consulting Wikipedia, the encyclopedia that anybody can edit, I learned that Arcadia is a region of Greece landlocked by mountains and inhabited by people who lived the proverbial simple pastoral life.  Apparently it is much the same in the modern day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think what Onstad means by the album cover art being a hail Mary pass from Arcadia is that it's sort of a connection; a thing from the past that is still relevant today.  And apparently T just didn't get it, and the perfectly aimed pass bounced right off his head. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't worry T, I also don't understand anything, ever.

      I guess it went out of practice shortly in the recent past.  (In a 3-year span in the 1990s, presumably).  I always kind of figured it was the only reason they kept making LPs after the advent of the cassette.  But I guess audiophiles and rappers probably each had more to do with it.

      Please notice that in the second picture of the Abraxas cover, the dove has been moved up slightly.  The first picture is the real album cover ( <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145832/https://www.jimlawrence77.net/LPCOVERS/abraxas.jpg">https://www.jimlawrence77.net/LPCOVERS/abraxas.jpg</a> ).   , therefore the second must be Teodor's memory of it.

      I liked the record player in this one, and while I didn't spend time looking in my dad's record collection for pics of girls, I did go through it a lot.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
He had a lot of Dylan. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As well as The Band. I ended up with his LP of Stage Fright and listened to it tons of times. <br/>

      If it's any comfort to Theodore, I always liked the album cover to Abraxas, too. In fact, I'm actually kinda glad I read this particular strip, because I couldn't remember what that album was called. To my credit, I did suspect that it was a Santana album, though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just to be clear, I never masturbated over the Abraxas cover. Just took it out and stared at it a lot, whenever I was alone with my mother's music collection.

      The cover always entranced me, but the album itself is something else.  One of my favorite albums start to finish.
