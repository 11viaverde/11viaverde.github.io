      Kind of bothers me that every mention of Pat in assetbar has to have some reference to his sexuality. Like that's a defining trait of his personality. I don't know about you guys, but when I think of Pat, I think of him yelling at Arthur. I think of getting worked up because Vlad left rude messages on his message board. I picture a guy rewarding Roast Beef with shitty health food after Beef did his taxes for him. I do not picture Pat takin' it in the can.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I take that all back, when I think of Pat the first thing I usually think of is that image of him waving sausages around with his meat tent pitched. Forget I said anything.

      Once upon a time in a place far far away, I did work as a lifeguard, as spoken of old.  In this place, a young boy about 11 or 12 years old continually mis-used the word "homosexual".  He began using it as a verb. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At a convenient point in the narative, I asked him if he knew what the word meant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"You bet I do!  What do you think I am? Studpid or something?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Well, no, I just don't know if you have the right idea here" sez I. "What exactly do you think it means?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
He said "I know what it means! I've seen it".   <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Of course you have but could you be a little more plain?" I asked. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Yeah! Last Sunday morning, I got up early cause I heard some grunting noises.  I looked into my parents bedroom and saw my dad homosexualizing my mother!!!  Don't tell me what it means; I've seen it!" <br/>

      This is  <em>exactly</em>  what I was thinking - the clean and prissy look may have been all the rage at some point in the 80's (fitting in well with the rest of the 80's), but Playgirl strikes me as an establishment that is at least 5 years behind the times.

      Basically, this exact same situation happened to me. <br/> 
In my case, the parents did not show any intention of alerting authorities, but rather lectured me on how I had simultaneously destroyed both the wholesome day they were having, the innocence in their children's minds, and the photo they were intending to purchase with one joking lewd pose. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am fairly certain it was nothing the kids would've interpreted as out of the ordinary, as they were young as hell and kids don't guess things can be charades of sex acts. However, because the parents were so levelheaded yet so adamant about how awful we were, I momentarily could not see how ridiculous they were acting: the only response I could manage was a look of confused guilt and a mumbled "sorry" followed by running the hell away.

      My dad had a big stash of porn, but had kept it hidden from my sister and I for awhile, but I managed to find it when I was around 12. magazine and vhs. Stuff from the seventies up to early nineties. I was meticulous at first in how I'd leave the magazines EXACTLY how I found them, the vhs's rewound to the exact second... One day though, after I came home from school and took my fill of a Swank, I guess I thought I'd have free reign of the house for awhile and left the magazine out on the den couch, and I guess I must have left the house for soccer practice or to hang out with a friend or something, because I remember coming back to hearing my sister crying. I crept to the den and peered in and my Dad was awkwardly explaining to my sobbing sister who had found the magazine why he had porn. I actually heard her say "Why would you have that? The women doing things like that?" SWank was a really dirty, explicit, hardcore moneyshot magazine in a world of tamer Playboys and Penthouses.  <br/> 
He must have thought he had left it out, because he never mentioned it to me, or maybe he didn't think it necessary to have two terrible conversations. My sister never mentioned it to me. <br/> 
Worst part: later on that week, my mom sat me down and explained that in case I didn't know, Dad had a porn "problem" and that he was "going to see someone about it." <br/> 
I wanted to vomit from shame.

      Your father, was his name, by any chance, Armand? <br/>

 <em>Swank</em>  is truly great. Not the magazine itself, never bothered with it much, but the title is wonderful and perfectly applied to a hardcore porno magazine. I try to refer to far more things as "swank" in my daily life as a small reference to it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also  <em>Club</em>  is a pretty good name, but it goes for a slightly different market IIRC. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now that I think about it, was  <em>Swank</em>  really that much harder than, say,  <em>Hustler</em> ? Or was  <em>Hustler</em>  just the hard 'R' between the PG-13  <em>Playboy</em>  and the depths of true filth?

      <em>Swank</em>  was about the same level of filth as  <em>Hustler</em> , but it was all sex as opposed to Larry Flynt's rants about hypocrisy, politics, religion, etc.  Real anti-boner stuff.   <em>Oui</em> ,  <em>Genesis</em> ,  <em>Cherry</em> ,  <em>Club</em>  and it's sister mag  <em>Club International</em> ... those were the days.

      <em>Oui</em>  though was just a  <em>Playboy</em>  spin-off. I never thought it was really able to compete properly. At the same time the 70s had some very cute girls. Not exclusively, but it seems like there was much more of a call for cute, girl-next-door types than the modern implanted and tarted up silicone skanks. I would cast Seka into the latter category unfortunately. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Isn't  <em>Swank</em>  still being published though? I mean, I know  <em>Club</em>  is. Or, at least, it was a few years ago when I last saw a copy.

      I saw one a couple of years ago. My friend's girlfriend had just broken up with him and he was home at his parents' place for a couple of days. We were coming back from the city at 5 in the morning and before he dropped me off, he insisted on driving around looking for a 7-11 where he could purchase something to get him through the weekend. Apparently it was the best thing they had, and it was still hella terrible.

      I seem to remember that the actually jaw-closing action required a great deal more force than my undeveloped thumbs could muster. I had to use my entire hand to activate the mechanism, which meant that having my action figure chew guns into scrap metal was awkward and fumbling, to say the least.

      Man, what happened to Lego though? Everything it seems is licensed now and there isn't nearly as much possibility for variety as there used to be what with all the custom pieces and all. I mean, yeah, it was going that way when I was still young, but it seems a lot worse now. Oh and some of the Star Wars sets are cool, but the good ones are usually like $100 or so. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Fisher Price Imaginext Dragon looks pretty sweet though. I saw one of those the other day at the store and my girlfriend was clearly enamored with it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh and that dinosaur you can ride on (and what in the fuck is with it not actually walking around? That's totally lame)? That definitely goes in "Toys Belgand Wishes He Had When He Was a Lad but They Weren't Invented Yet". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am still a bit upset that I never got the Eternia playset, but that thing was wicked pricey. Still, it had a  <em>monorail</em> . How could I not desire it? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Best toy ever though? Omagles. I don't think I ever saw these anywhere else, but a relative got them for me one year and it was one of the biggest boxes I ever got and one of the most awesome things ever. Basically large, kid-sized erector set or such where you could build stuff out of these big plastic pipes. Completely boss. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Damn, I need to find a place for my two giant tubs of Legos, my box of Omagles, and my two or so big yellow official cases full of Construx. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I need to shut up now or this will just be me going on about how much more awesome toys were in the 80s before video games completely took over and when you could still just get by with awesome action figures and such. I don't even really know what kids play with any more.

      I have got on this same soapbox before about legos.  When I was a lad you'd just have a ton of different ones and make Whatever in the Fuck you Wanted.  Now it's all stupid-ass kits to build like Harry Potter or Pokey-Mans or whatever it is.  Boo.

      Well, the Pirate and Castle kits were pretty sweet. I mean, I certainly like having some sort of basic guide rather than just a big box of various generic bits and being told to just work it out yourself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Having a base to work from prevents the sort of blank page problem that would crop up otherwise. Plus, assuming you have a place to keep it, you can keep working on it until you get something entirely your own. I had a castle that I'd been working on that was so awesome when I moved during my childhood it got placed into a tub more or less intact. As far as I know it is probably still largely intact. One day I will continue my work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not to mention that sometimes the somewhat specialized pieces could be put to new use as long as they were architectural in nature and not just something plastered with an image or a big chunk of plastic that doesn't really connect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember when they changed the old pirate cannons from the kind that would shoot out a small black barrel piece to the kind that looked better, but didn't shoot. The former were definitely prized. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Man, looking at some of what came out why did they ever get rid of the Vikings and Ninja themes? Those look like they were awesome, but lasted for very short times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you do not like ninja then you are not rad.

      I never cared for the Samurai/Ninja sets.  The buildings themselves were not very exciting, but I used the samurai helmets for pretty good Nazi helmets.  I much preferred Wild West, Johnny Thunder and Pirates.  Man, I had this OLD set, that was old by my standards, with two what I imagined to be Spanish soldiers with muskets and a tropical fort type deal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My sets always ALWAYS broke, for one reason or another.  But I always built better stuff, like a town that took up half my room's floor.  I played with Legos till I was like 14.  Actually, I remember, last year some time I broke out a few pieces and went crazy for about 10 minutes, just to get it out.  Shit, I want to play with Legos now :( <br/>

      I was right on the cusp of that transition from sets of airports and pizzerias and the Wild West to Harry Potter sets, MLS sets, NASA sets (which actually were hxc good times) etc.  I was a Lego FIEND.  I had callouses from ramming my hand into my huge buckets of Legos.  I bet I couldn't do that today.

      I never understood that either. Maybe we should make soft-core porn legal down to age 12? It is the market that will best be able to appreciate it. <br/>

If you're old enough to know that you want porn you're old enough to have porn. I will never understand why people do not get this. This also fits into my previous statement that young girls ought to have access to basic vibrators and some non-threatening dildos maybe.

      I do not believe that it works quite like that. If a man is having that much trouble I must wonder if his tongue has been cut out. Is most pleasant of tasks? Eh... for some maybe, but not all. But necessary to be causing pleasure of woman and thus ensuring further interest in the making of loves. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also is not possible young lady can be using device while with horny gentleman friend? Maybe is to be show putting on for him? Perhaps simply enhance of the pleasure for more direct stimulation that she, like many womens, is needing? Or even she is saucy lass and wishes to make hat trick with only one of the sex dudes? Girl who is wanting to explore is main hotness and should be encouraged the most. <br/>

Greater problem, I am thinking, is that girls are not knowing that sex is bodacious in the maximum.

      The real shame of it all is that the Internet has stolen from pubescent boys the passage to manhood that was finding ways to sneak peeks at pornography. With porn practically falling out of your computer monitor onto your keyboard with even a slightly suggestive word in your search terms, the hunt is truly over. RIP surreptitious glances in the back of B Dalton. RIP locating dad's porn stash in the attic. RIP the joy of finding that foreign dude who ran the newsstand by the train station and didn't care if you bought a Playboy or not, as long as you didn't crumple the pages of the ones left in the rack.

      Totally, man.  Almost everyone I know my age or older has some story about a stash of porn they found in a bramble or a ditch or somewhere.  Porn used to be like a precious physical commodity, even if it was crinkled and had suspect stains and pages that were stuck together.  You'd just like tear those ones out.  Or you'd have a friend whose dad had tons of playboys, and you'd steal one, and then you'd be afraid to even go over there in case he noticed that empty spot between May and July 1978.  Or there'd be a kid who would always have pornos and sell them.  He'd probably be in a trench coat.

      dude, stealing a playboy requires mega cajones. plus you aint got no place to store that when you're still sleeping on the same mattress as your mom. what you do is you wait until the magazine owner is out, sneak into his room, burn into your memory the exact order and corner to edge arrangement of each zine to the next. you read that shit furiously, ears perked, heart racing, flipping pages and absorbing pictures and words like a fiend running some timed task in a video game, sand all streaming out your timer, boss all lurking around the corner waiting to pound the shit out of you. then you meticulously arrange it back to look exactly like how you found it, all before the dude comes home.  <br/>

I think the crucial factor is how you convey to the child that it's OK for them to use them. That they don't have to be paranoid about being found out. The subtle wink that is part of the whole enterprise.

      Well, no. That would take the whole thrill out of it. There has to be some element of danger and shame and fear of being found out. Otherwise your kids might grow up to be those people that prattle on about how sex is a perfectly natural and fun thing to do and it's totally cool to be a sex worker.

      It persisted on to my generation as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At one point I had a stash of like, two  <em>Playboys</em>  and a  <em>Penthouse</em>  that I got from a friend who, I believe, got them from his father's stash. They were buried in a Ziploc bag inside of a plastic bag under a rock in a vacant lot near our houses where we had constructed a fort and spent much of our time. Eventually I presume I forgot about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A few years ago I was home over break or such and I went back to my old neighborhood to see how things had changed since I was a child. My friend there had moved back in high school and I had moved a bit earlier and it was definitely not the same place. You used to be able to see the rock wall that we spent most of an autumn constructing from the highway, but I don't think I could find any trace of it anymore only the barest outlines of the rocks, tires, and maybe a few bits of the scrap wood that had made up our sanctuary that we used to know so well. I think the old table that had once been there was missing. I remembered roughly where I had hidden the old magazines and, despite knowing that over a decade or so in a place with snow and rain would have decimated them, but at least I would find their remains and have that small connection to the past, but they were gone with no trace to show that they had ever been there. I don't know what happened to them, but I hope that another child found them not long after me and they were passed on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A few years ago I was out in the back alleys of the college town where I was living over the last weekend in May trying to hunt down a new couch from the vast array that were left as students left town at the end of the semester. While doing so (and finding a great reclining couch as well) I stumbled across a treasure trove of maybe two solid years of  <em>Playboy</em>  including the 50th Anniversary issue that had been left out for the trash. I immediately loaded them up in the car and brought them home. When I moved a few years later it was with a certain degree of regret that I too threw almost all of them away with only a few brought along because of interesting articles or such (Chuck Palahnick's  <em>Guts</em> , some of Hunter S. Thompson's last published work, the aforementioned anniversary issue). Reading them with my girlfriend on the lengthy car trip across the country I was again reminded of that childhood stash and lamented that much as I had been filled with the same feeling when I found this recent trove I was unable to find someone to pass it on to. Even worse I doubt that the modest collection of the softest of soft-core would have held any real appeal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You also forget staying up late into the morning in order to watch a movie showing on Cinemax because it has a provocative-sounding title and perhaps the tell-tale listings of Nudity and Strong Sexual Content. Maybe it is starring Shannon Tweed in some capacity (sexy sex therapist perhaps? lonely wife exploring her budding interest in voyeurism?). Even for the times that you end up watching Primal Fear rather than Body Chemistry 4: Full Exposure. And let's definitely not forget the classic Real Sex series or it's 90s bandwagon sibling Sex Bytes.

      I recently moved to a new city and am renting a room in a house.   On my first day here, the landlord and I spent the day clearing the room of clutter which he had let it gradually accumulate, much of it from the days when he lived here as a bachelor.   He has since married and produced a son, who was along for the day, helping clean up in his seven-year-old way.   We were carting boxes of his old possessions out of my closet into a storage room, when the following conversation occurred: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kid:  "What's in this box, dad?" <br/> 
Dad:  "Oh, that's old National Geographics.   Maybe we can take that and your mom can look through and see if there are any she wants to save." <br/> 
Kid:  "And what's in this one, dad?" <br/> 
Dad:  "Um, that's just more old magazines.   Don't worry about it." [quickly hands the box to me] <br/> 
Kid:  "Maybe mom would want these too?" <br/> 
Dad:  "Um, I don't think she would." <br/> 
Kid:  "Are they the wrong kind of magazine?" <br/> 
Dad:  "Yes!   They're the wrong kind of magazine!" [knowing glance at me] <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sure enough I took a peek and it was full of old  <em>Penthouse</em> s.   The whole scene went just like something out of a movie or somethin' and just gave me hella poignant chuckles.

 <br/> 
We need to maintain a depository of pornographic materials. Some magazines and perhaps a few DVDs to pass on to the next generation. This should be every child's pubescent birthright. Whole cultures and rituals forming around the passage of this essential information. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sure the Internet will supersede it to a certain degree, but that might not always be ideal. We must keep the traditions of our forefathers alive. Printed porn has existed since the time of the Romans (yeah, you want to imagine how much you'll value an erotic scroll or perhaps some Japanese shunga?) and I doubt it will ever entirely fade away. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It will get pretty faded over time though so add some newer stuff to the box as needed.

      Y'know what, looking at porn at an early age is a terrifying thrill no matter the medium. Perhaps kids don't need to tape Hustlers to the bottom of their drawers anymore, but I am sure that even today they lie awake in bed imagining secret methods their parents might employ to discover the websites they have been viewing  <em>on the family computeeeeeeer</em> .

      You forgot hearing your mom at the exact moment of yelling at you from the kitchen to come eat already because your dinner's getting cold on account that you've been trying for half an hour unsuccessfully because at the slightest sound of footsteps you shove the magazine under your covers, grab the open algebra textbook you've placed nearby, and pretend to be reading it attentively, stopping short so many times that by now it's not even gonna be good anymore, and so you're trying so hard to answer "just a second!" in your most normal-sounding voice but of course it comes out all strained and breathless as you're going through your little convulsions and you just know that she knows exactly what you're doing and of course hearing her voice made you think of her, but that doesn't mean anything, right? you tell yourself reassuringly as you shuffle to the bathroom to wash your hands.

      But, and excuse me if I'm somehow incorrect in some way with this, aren't you a lady? Was this really a main interest of yours at this age? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had thought this was mainly thing of dudes, yes? Is there appropriate analog for ladies? I think, in way, ladies have it harder. Is no way to safely acquire sex toys at young age when they are most needed. Solution must be found. I mean, should not 14 year-old girls be supplied with just such as a basic vibrator? To be using hairbrush is very bad idea I am told. Can cause... damages and much unpleasantness.

      psh, my main prurient interest as a young lass was looking at shock images on the internet.   <br/>

And yeah, pretty much it'd be very tough for a girl to have that same ease-of-masturbation that men have.  It takes more effort than a willing genital, a hand, and a fuzzy memory of breasts.

      Well, you can do it totally manual and there are certainly plenty of women who prefer it this way, but I'm certain that technology certainly helps matters. Not to mention that young girls wanting to learn of the ways of the flesh are likely going to want to try an approximation of the event itself and thus will seek something more penetrating than they can provide on their own. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Images of fuzzy breasts (i.e. such as those seen though a sweater on a classmate) are definitely even more readily available to boys. I never thought this was a major problem for girls due to a lesser interest in a visual component. I still don't know what it is girls are looking for. The ladies I know whom I can ask such things either have all failed to provide adequate information or are such total sex-preverts (e.g. pegging a man wearing water wings in a  <em>specific</em>  alleyway around town that they point out every time you walk past and giggle a little bit) that they cannot be trusted to provide an accurate depiction of what most girls care for. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm told that women tend to look for more of a narrative. An erotic fantasy scenario to be imagined and acted out. Romance novels would certainly support this hypothesis, but anecdotal evidence does not. That or the ladies I know are simply lacking in imagination and are part of the rare group that simply do not have sexual fantasies.

      My friend Pawel who's currently in law school was born in Poland and pretty much all his stories end the same way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like that time we got really drunk and went over to the bad side of town and we were like "Man let's get us a prostitute" but we didn't have much cash so had to go with a really old gal with short blonde hair and sagging tits. We tried to do her on both sides but she was pretty much dry everywhere so we were like fuck this and we walked away but when she was like "Where my money?" we were like "We're not payin for your wrinkly old ass" and "We didn't have any money anyway" then she started screamin and followin us even though she could barely walk straight what with her heels and coke-addled brain and all and all I could think was "Man this bitch is crazy she don't have a tooth in her mouth but that did not help her blowjobs any." Finally she said "I got somethin for yo ass" and reached into her purse but we just bum rushed her, Pawel trying to wrench the gun out of her hand, me putting her in a half nelson. Then the gun went off into the air right before she started screaming and I realized Pawel was probably breaking her arm and I almost shouted "Don't break her arm" but then she dropped the gun and just collapsed so we broke. We made it back to the subway away from the sounds of her screams and went back to his place and took turns using the shower. His roommate was out with her friends that night and Pawel offered to let me sleep in her bed but I just said "I'll take the couch, thanks." We were too restless to sleep so we sat down and watched  <em>Big Trouble in Little China</em>  but neither of us laughed. I looked at Pawel and he was just staring straight ahead and I said "What's wrong." He shook his head. Covered his eyes with his hands. Then he looked at me and said, "When the gun went off, I came." <br/> 
 <br/> 
We drank and we danced for many hours afterwards.

      I used to be able to get off to just people kissing. I would videotape Big Red commercials. One time I saw an illustration in an encyclopedia volume I had under the article for "Hat" which had a woman wearing an elegant-looking hat, and a dress with a somewhat low neckline - that image lasted me for months.

I'm back to attractive fully-clothed females, being somewhat flirtatious.  BOOM!

      The way I see it, porn is basically this n-dimensional space, where each axis represents a certain attribute present in the porn, and there is a corresponding attraction value that varies in all these dimensions.  What you gotta do is find a stable point where no one attribute can be adjusted to increase your level of attraction.  It's not like you're just going to keep wanting more and more boobs until the screen is full of them.  There's an optimal size (which may depend on other factors) and you just have to find it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Double penetration and other "kinky" acts are just the discovery of new axes to explore, and naturally your equilibrium will change when these new avenues become available to you, and you may find what originally interested you to no longer be sufficient, as you know there is much better out there.

that was fun until my mom found it on the computer. along with pictures of belle getting it from the candle. there were many screams that night. i have continued to disappoint and outrage her poor soul ever since.

      They would come and she would leave them on the table for like 3 days then throw them in the recycling basket thing we had, then I'd swipe it to do the Deed, then after losing some good catalogs and ads, I would wait till enough recycling covered it, then I'd swipe it and keep it in my room.  Then I would periodically hate myself and throw them all out, then regret it, then start over again.  Ah, 13!

      I suppose I fall somewhere in the middle here, between the hard-fought glimpses of be-froed eighties ladies and the modern pornucopia. I remember doing some crazy surreptitious bean-flicking to the 14th level of the original Diablo, all blue succubus titties fighting me... and I wasn't supposed to be playing it anyway, and the double-forbiddenness nearly blew my little adolescent mind.

      This is terrible thing to do. Not all can be five! <br/>

You must set a default value and then only give out sparing five to comics that rise well above that baseline. Compare the comic to itself, not all other comics.

      It depends on what the mean and standard deviation are. Assuming a mean of 3 and standard deviation of 1, about 6.68% of strips should get a 5 (assuming that strips valued at 4.5 or higher earn a 5). If (and it seems to be a big if these days, no offense Onstad, we all appreciate the work you do here for free) Onstad posts five comics a week, that means about seventeen 5's per year. <br/>

I used  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100408135549/https://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/z_table.html">this site</a>  for my Z-value by the way. In case anyone cares.

      This assumes a symmetric bell curve.  Which is good as far as it goes.  But I think that the consensus is that the  <em>Average for Onstad</em>  strip would be  <em>Above Average</em> , and therefore the mean would be above 3. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I certainly assume an average strip is more along the lines of a 4.  But I have great admiration for the strip, especially in comparison to any other comic I know of, web or otherwise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Well, there are  <em>This Modern World</em> , and  <em>Tom the Dancing Bug</em> .  But that's another story.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
But anyway, mean of 3, standard deviation of 1 is an OK way to look at it, but not the way  <em>I</em>  look at it.

      True, but you're still rating it in comparison to outside factors. They are not, realistically, in play here so they should be excluded. This is merely a subjective rating in reference to other Achewood strips. Thus the average rating should remain 3.

      I've always rated it against my own perception of what is funny. A five is usually a strip that makes me laugh out loud more than once or has an extremely memorable and clever turn of phrase (as opposed to just the random metaphors that he'd been churning out lately). It's also usually a strip that I want to be able to easily access by looking at my top rated list, and one that more or less stands alone so that I could show it to people as an introduction. A four is a strip that makes me laugh, but is either way too contextual, or the laugh is of a lower intensity. I think that for most of 2003-2007 I rated most of the strips as 4 or 5, but I have no problem giving a strip a 1 either.

      Very interesting. I seem to have a very different method of rating things than other people. I've noticed this on Netflix and such in the past. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I want them to conform to this bell curve concept. That most things start as average, but need to push themselves up or down to get higher ratings. This will, of course, be rarer and rarer the higher or lower it gets. Reaching the top of bottom requires a lot more effort and should designate something as the absolute cream-of-the-crop and not something to be seen often. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Liking something isn't enough, to me, to make it 5. I have to like it significantly above the things I rate 4 and so on. As before, all ratings start at 3 and move from there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The biggest cause of conflict for this is in something like Netflix where your ratings will be used to make recommendations. If I rate a film a 3 I still probably want it recommended to me. It might be a personal favorite even, but it's not great.

      I think if the intended use of ratings is to suggest films to you, you should judge entirely by how much you like it, not how "good" it is.  It's not really clear what the ratings here are for, so anything works. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I rate strips if I need more lames.  Doesn't happen much so I've probably only rated a couple dozen.

      Like I said, I think the main purpose of ratings here is to keep track of the best strips and be able to easily access them from your profile. There are far too many good ones to remember, even if you restrict yourself to the very best. Hence, the rating system. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's also used to suggest strips to others via the "Highest Rated" section, but I don't care much about that, especially seeing as how people put things like the wedding strip up there, making it essentially useless for introductory purposes.

      This is another comic that made me hate Ray. I had friends like this in middle school - the cool older kid who knows that a dork like you is just so honored to hang out with him that you can be talked into doing all kinds of stupid shit that gets you and not him into trouble, or lending him things only to later hear some wildly improbable excuse for why they are not given back. The difference is that they're still living in the same shitty town and I am no longer friends with them.

      I loaned out my copy of Mario Kart for the SNES to a friend of that sort of friend. It never came back. Interestingly enough the games I had received in collateral for this loan were Final Fantasy II and Ys III: Wanderers From Ys. FFII is now worth a lot more and holds up as the much better game while I play more recent Mario Kart games. Truly I made out in the end. I'm still a bit upset about it though. I mean, I even have the Mario Kart box and manual sitting in my parent's basement.

      At first, this strip makes you think, "Damn, Ray was a really mean friend to put Beef in those kinds of situations". <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then you realize, if Beef had just been left to his own devices, he'd just be spending all day looking at the ceiling, following the cracks with his eyes, thinking about his mom or something. <br/>

Ray is obviously the only reason Beef was able to leave the house as a child.

      That is a bullshit way of looking at things. It's like when an extremely awkward and introverted friend of mine (even more so than me) started going out with this artsy girl who seemed perfect except she ended up cheating on him like 10 times and fucking with his head before flying away like the carefree butterfly that she is, leaving him a broken shell of a man, and in response to him bitching about it on livejournal, a friend of hers informed him that he should be happy just to have had her come into his life, however briefly. <br/>

      Oh, the girl in question was most definitely quirky as well. She used to add a syllable to her last name to make her first and last names rhyme when she wrote them on worksheets in elementary school, and whenever she ordered a smiley face pancake at IHOP she would ask them to make it into a sad face. Please tell us your feelings on the subject.

      everybody does shit like that in elementary school. it's only when you select random occurrences of them and link them together in flowery prose that they assume a quirky character in retrospect. <br/>

as for the pancake thing-- my feelings on Amelie are con. also, people like this tend to be non-sarcastic. i find that offensive and suffocating.

      uh, this has nothing to do with shoplifting nudie mags? nobody told your friend to date this chick, or to remain a broken shell of a man after her departure. if it were me, i'd get the fuck over it cuz i wouldn't want to be with someone so morally bankrupt as to cheat on me repeatedly anyway. that is an immature child of a girl whom you should feel sorry for, not the other way around. that being said, there is also something wrong with your friend in refusing to get over her. in fact, he seems like the self-pitying type who loves being victimized and hangs onto it as both the cause and justification of his miserable life. i just can't bring myself to feel sorry for people like that. there's a whole world out there, or something. if you want to sit at home and cry over spilled milk, that's your problem.

      yea but your analogy fails because ray was trying to help beef out with a cool thing and beef messed it up and got faced with consequences whereas in your example the girl might have thought she was helping your friend out in dating him but certainly did not think she was helping him out in breaking up with him. ray was completely well intentioned the entire time, is all i'm saying.

      No way. Ray was getting Beef to do the dirty work while he 'kept watch' and then he split and abandoned him at the first sign of danger. Plus Beef didn't even wanna do it but he probably thought that if he didn't Ray would tell everyone at school that he was a pussy (which he probably would).

      Yeah, Ray isn't trying to dick over Beef. He tells him to get out of there and before that to hurry up. Beef just freezes up because this is not his sort of thing and he's nervous. <br/>

      I think I assumed that because of Beef saying "why couldn't you do this part". That suggests a division of labor, and Ray getting the less dangerous end of the deal. I assumed it meant Ray was getting Beef to steal for both of them. I suppose it could be that Ray had already done it alone and was just helping Beef get his, but then I don't see Beef being so arrogant as to say that.

      We must now hear tales of your own personal Ray and how he lead you to this place. We see amusing youthful hijinks and you are describing a tale of how the more confidant, wealthy cat is manipulating the weaker-willed one into doing his bidding and suffering all the consequences. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think, if anything, it's more about how everything always comes up Ray, but Beef always gets it the worst. He doesn't just get caught, he gets caught and then only gets let off due to pity and understanding of a sort that he did not intend. <br/>

It's not so much how they treat each other as how the universe treats them.

      One time while drunk with a Ray-ish friend of mine he wanted to break into an apartment to rob it. I wisely skipped out, and was pretty mad about it after. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another Ray-ish friend stole a fire extinguisher in a fancy downtown hotel and ran around spraying it, which set off about four floors of fire alarms. He had basically forced a rich kid friend of ours to rent the hotel room for us. Previous to the fire alarms he took some incredibly drunk girl and fucked her in the kid's bed, and then when she was too drunk to walk he just picked her up and left her in the hallways outside the elevator. After the fire alarms I could tell things were escalating pretty quick so I vamoosed at midnight. I'm still pretty surprised I didn't get arrested.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is the same dude who cheated on his girlfriend with this one older girl who lived in the same building as him. I didn't know this, so I was talking to the girl one day and I discovered a mutual love of Tom Waits, and the friend said, "Hey, maybe if you're nice, [Girl's Name] here will lay you," and she laughed and said, "Oh, why would I want to sleep with anyone who doesn't have your pretty face?"  <em>That</em>  was pretty great for the old ego.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then there was a kid in my neighborhood who would always act all friendly and tell you about all the cool stuff he'd show you, and he'd lure you out to the creek and the cool stuff would invariable killing, capturing, or torturing animals. At the very least it involved playing with guns. I think I went with him twice before I got it into my 11 year old head that maybe this dude is not the guy to hang out with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically what I'm telling you is that at a very young age I figured out that 80% of most people, or at the very least guys, are fucking horrible. I don't know if having girls as kids are any better, but that's what I want. No boys. Boys are monsters, including me.

      agreed. i had a best friend like that who put me in Situations but without whom i might have ended up strictly studious and hell of fob. shoplifting was a particularly cherished past-time of ours. her all wearing big jncos and stuffing into her socks vampirella comics, blue seed vhs's, whole lotions from bath and body works. me all wearing a big jacket stuffing mad gelly pens up the sleeves and bad religion cds in the inner chest pockets. coming home and unloading our loot, trading shit, then baking a pizza and watching the x-files when it wasn't a goddamn soap opera. fourth, fifth, and sixth grade man. the golden age before i got depression.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
after that it was just all oh my god what am i doing about these boobs and uh i think i'm kinda overweight because i can't buy jeans that fit right and everytime i go see my grandparents in china everyone is all "you look so  <em>healthy</em> ", all "what do they feed you there?", all "you eat lots of pizza and cheeseburgers everyday, don't you?" and i'm all thinking if i wear really loose shirts nobody will notice i have boobs but oh noes! there's gym class and we have to change in front of each other and i just about died when i told my mom i needed to buy a bra it was kind of like saying to her i need a bra because i have boobs and i have boobs because i am eventually going to have sex and bring dishonor to our entire family i hope you are ok with that mom, sorry.

      The closest I ever came was going to a TCBY and trying a few samples of various flavors with no intent of buying any with a friend. Eventually they became dicks to us and demanded that we had to buy something. We only had something like twenty cents so they eventually let us pay for a single topping which was served to us in a small paper cup. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still blame my friend because I wanted to take off as soon as I thought they were getting a bit suspicious and, unlike Ray, I was not yet smart enough to just run off and leave the bastard who couldn't be bothered to save himself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, is that not the most dick thing ever to do to a young kid? I mean, yeah, we slightly abused the policy, but they were free samples! Wouldn't the normal thing to do be to just say that if we weren't going to buy anything they couldn't give us any more samples and maybe politely ask us to leave? <br/> 
 <br/> 
That was at least 15 years ago and I can still remember how humiliating and terrible that was. Way to go dicks. You've traumatized me sufficiently.

      My friends and I memorized the weekly schedule of a mildly retarded girl who worked at the Ben Franklin store near my house. We would just rob her blind. She always smiled at us. A real smile. When she wasn't working we'd go over to the grocery store and steal glass bottles of just anything. We would then exit the store and proceed to smash the bottles against the side of the place. We never used what we stole unless it was candy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I think back on all this, it's amazing to me that we actually grew up to be just basic humans. My main accomplice from those days is now a lawyer in Chicago. I grew up fine. I'm nice to folks, and all. <br/>

      No personal offense, but I suspect this is the way of many people. They just learn to hide it more as they grow up and it comes out in more subtle and terrifying ways. <br/>

      My life was and, perhaps to a degree still is, composed more of the Beef-like fear that I will get busted. So I avoid doing anything that I could conceivably get busted for doing. Even things that probably aren't problematic enough to get busted for themselves, but might imply more going on or at least be slightly embarassing. <br/>

When you accept getting busted as inevitable or at least are completely unwilling to take the chance that it might happen it doesn't even need to happen. <br/>

      You are not involved. It certainly stemmed from your own nickname, but expanded. It is a snappier, shortened, slanged up form of "Robotic Vagina" with the sleek, dazzling veneer of the 1980s. <br/>

The fact that you has transmuted into a large penis would make it seem like you would enjoy this or, at least, engage in some sort of unholy conjugation with it. <br/>

      I cringe any time I see the jokes about rape.  But then, there is lots of bleak history in my life relating to rape.  Not for me personally, but for people I have been close to, including one who did not survive the episode, and was found days later by me. <br/>

      Ouch. Well that is terrible, and if I knew that and were just talking to you and a few other people I would obviously avoid such jokes.

Otherwise we wouldn't be able to joke about anything because of people like that "not funny, not cool" girl who got mad at Onstad for mentioning antidepressants in the strip because her friend overdosed on them.

      The acronym AIDS was introduced in July, 1982, replacing the earlier GRID (gay-related immunodeficiency disease).  It took a long time, well into late 1983 into 1984, for any real awareness of AIDS to penetrate general public awareness.  The case of Ryan White became a public affair in 1985, and it was only then that AIDS/HIV became a subject of broad public awareness.

      There were several illnesses making the rounds back then among gay men in the larger cities.  People in the thick of things were aware that something seemed to be going on, but there was no way to know with any certainty.  The initial medical case reports that were published in 1981 detailing Kaposi's Sarcoma and pneumocystus carinii pneumonia made no dent in the awareness of anyone except for a few public health and medical people.  When my first friend died in '82, he was one of some 325 recognized cases of what had just been defined as AIDS.  It was in retrospect that we realized that many people had in fact been ill with HIV for a very long time, and what had seemed to be odd trends were finally understood as the amplification of the epidemic.

      This is one of the best, most heart-wrenching strips I've ever seen. I swear to God, this comic has been straight praxis lately, I feel like more fully human after a read. But this strip... it's perfect. I truly appreciate the compassion of the Waldenbooks clerk, and I doubly appreciate that the compassion is only shown after some accidental gay soft-core happenstance. It's a cake made of tears with smile frosting (fuck, that's going to be my new myspace quote).

      Yep. Almost all of the other atheists I know celebrate Christmas under some name or another. It's not a religious holiday to the majority of people so it's really not much of an issue. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I believe Squidmas is the name gaining traction now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll join Elbox in enjoying not having to see my family, but enjoying even more how I'm getting gifts. I don't have any money to buy them for anyone else, but money from Christmas is my primary source of income for the rest of the year.

      Yea, but I don't get gifts either. In Russia, people often got each other presents for New Years (which was celebrated like American Christmas in almost every way), but I don't think it was absolutely required. In any case, my birthday was about a week after New Years, so I just got one set of presents. Then after we moved I also started getting Hannukah presents, which is great because it's a holiday where kids get presents from all their relatives and don't have to do anything in return. Eventually that stopped, and now I get nothing, which is more than balanced out by me not having to buy anything. I am a man of simple needs and I've always kind of felt that gift exchange is just a roundabout way of making you spend money in order to receive things that you don't get to choose, don't really need, or wouldn't allow yourself to buy even if you really wanted them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I was under the impression that most atheists in America still have to spend the holidays with their families and participate in the whole gift thing. The only reason I don't is because my family never celebrated Christmas in the first place.

      I don't like my family and as I believe I have said before holidays were never about family when I grew up so it's not a part of it. I get gifts and I celebrate Christmas in a cultural sense though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I only throw a fit if people try to make Christmas more religious or about anything other than Santa bringing presents and having a week off work or such. All that spirit of Christmas crap? Not my bag at all, but at least it's better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It seems kind of shitty to not celebrate Christmas or Americanized Hannukah (i.e. Jewish Christmas for all intents and purposes) though. I mean, yeah Japan has the same sort of America fetish that we have for them, but even they celebrate Christmas these days. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Frankly I find cultures that celebrate the new year as the most important holiday of the year to be kinda weird. New Years is just... so lame as far as holidays go. Christmas works adequately as a big commercial gift-giving holiday. Sort of like it's everybody's birthday on the same day.

      What's the difference? When I say that New Years was the most important holiday in the USSR, what I mean is that they basically just took the whole Christmas celebration - Santa, tree, presents, and all - and moved it back a few days so there could be a non-religious pretext for it.

      Oh, yeah, forgot about that. I honestly wasn't even thinking of the USSR there. I was thinking about how it's more important in Japan (I actually do some research for my assets much of the time, confirm spelling, check that I'm not saying something completely incorrect, etc.). <br/> 
 <br/> 
The important thing is that you have a late December gift-giving holiday. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like having New Years as another holiday. Make it into a big thing. Gives us more holidays.

      My understanding is that the positions of New Years and Christmas in Japan are the reverse of here; that is, in Japan New Year's is this spiritual, spending-time-with-family thing, and Christmas doesn't mean much more than maybe some parties. I don't know if they give gifts on Christmas, though.

      From my rough and basic research children get presents on Christmas (I mean, gifting is a big part of the culture), but only when they're young because presents only come from Santa so once you're post-Santa no more gifts. It also is apparently more of a romantic holiday as well and there's a lot of pressure on women to have a date and some sort of big romantic display and such. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So from the appearances it's just commercial American Christmas, but with less overall cultural baggage and maybe a bit of Valentine's Day/New Year's date issues thrown in too. The pressure on women and dating seem to be a big problem there though. I mean, even looking at holidays they've also got Valentine's Day as well as White Day (which was created in the late 70s by a candy company so take that desperate, lonely losers who call Valentine's Day manufactured!) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah, New Year's is both more spiritual and more about family. Crazy to me.

      Nope.  <em>Lupercalia</em> . Ancient Roman (and likely pre-Roman) fertility festival that involved men sacrificing two goats and a dog and then running around whipping people with bloody lashes made from the freshly sacrificed animals' skins. Women whipped in this fashion were supposed to be blessed with greater fertility and easier childbirth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do, in principal, agree with you on some points. I have only given roses once on the day and only because, well, you need to engage in the tradition at least once. Otherwise, eh... it's so stereotypical. So bland and dull. I'd rather give them on another day when they can mean something other than "I have no creativity at all and enjoy being gouged heavily for mediocre flowers due to the sudden rise in demand". <br/> 
 <br/> 
But White Day was manufactured quite specifically by a single company in recent history. It really trumps Valentine's Day (and is intended as a male response to the female-focused Valentine's Day... giving that is, not receiving).

      No idea. I never met that guy, and I haven't talked to the bass player in years and years. <br/> 
 He was in a group with my sister's ex after they lost the Battle of Bands Asylum Records contract to Tom Petty, and then got into some very bad circumstances and ended up ripping them off. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 His life went straight into toiletsville pretty much through no fault of his own. <br/> 
 Originally a very nice guy. Very sweet guy.

      Don't they just put on a hell of a show? God <em>damn</em>  they do! I need to see them at a place with decent sound next time. Even through some basement bar's shitty PA they were fantastic. I can only imagine what it'd be like to hear them sounding correct live. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On second thought, it seems like they'll probably "break" sooner rather than later, so I guess I'll count myself as lucky to have been able to see them on the cheap and basically stand right next to them while they played. Those opportunities will soon be a thing of the past, I have to imagine.

      A lot better than "Spirit in the Sky" which always came across as kinda dickish. He totally  <em>knew</em>  he was getting into heaven. Hate people like that. No need to be all Catholic about it, but don't act like you got your letter from admissions already. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, "gonna recommend you to the spirit in the sky"? Like Jesus is his connection or something? He can totally get him in because he knows a guy? This keeps sounding like a worse and worse deal. <br/>

Also, yeah, it's a fun riff, but that song is just so damn repetitive. I think I liked it slightly more before Rock Band 2. That has totally ruined it for me.

      But Christians believe that, if they believe, they are saved (i.e., they get in).  Catholics, on the other hand, are only as good as their last absolution and waver between being tarnished by sin or in a state of grace.  They can never be sure. <br/>

      Depends on the specific denomination really. I'm still not totally up on the whole Jehovah's Witnesses thing where they have a set number of elect, but they keep trying to recruit more members. I mean, if they're predestined why even bother to do anything about it? It's not like it can be taken away. How do they know that the selected group aren't from around the world? It could just be a bunch of people who don't even care and have vastly different religious beliefs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I so totally don't get it. I would probably regret it, but I would possibly be interested in speaking to them about the specific of their theology so long as they realize that nobody's getting converted.

      It sounds like your impression of Catholic Christianity is out of date and full of rumors.  And the assertion that serving the needs of sinners is a racket is not worth refuting.  You can go to mass and/or reconciliation as seldom or as frequently as you need to in order to live a holy life.

      on the one hand, that whole Festivus concept seemed kinda forced and gimmicky. on the other, i have a huge crush on Frank Costanza, rivaled only by my even huger crush on George Costanza, so the episode was still awesome. words cannot describe how much love i have in my heart for George. perhaps it is my destiny to be with a bald, insecure, pudgy man-child who does not appreciate me? i am also seriously turned on by Carl from Aqua Teen, though i would prefer George because he is more, uh, introspective?

      When I was a kid my Mom took us to a church, or rather, a number of churches, that operated out of old storefronts, or industrial warehouse strip malls, in which people fainted in the aisles, spoke in tongues, and herky-jerked on the floor in religious ways for the Lord on Sunday mornings. I only occasionally was let into the Bedlam of the services, for the most part these churches kept the kids cloistered away under Sunday School protection, and on the rare occasion that I was exposed to the service I was always pretty scared. The point is I was raised pretty weirdly Christian. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, around this time in life I have a memory of myself being outside on a gray December day, jumping around a snowbank or pulling my sister in a sled, or some such, alongside the street that passed by our apartment building. I recall seeing a school bus roll by, with the words "Merry X-mas" written in the frost of the windows. The term X-mas troubled me, in fact it seemed like a way Satan might refer to Christmas. X-mas.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still get a little creeped out when I see it written that way.

Incidentally I am  <em>totally</em>  comfortable with being a guy and reading Cosmo. It mainly about sex or giving me a fresh reason to experience rage at the terrors of vapid idiocy and horrible mangling of the language. Let's just say that when you're taking Journalism in high school and have to go through old magazines to work on your yearbook mock-ups you get bored and everyone starts screwing around and taking quizzes and it leads to a sort of thing.

No clef but if you assume bass clef it is C followed by a bunch of Bs.  This makes sense with where his hand is, too, around the 8th and 7th frets on the E string.  Also it makes sense because metal people love a flat 2.

      It's pretty well known that a lot of Nirvana's songs are ridulously easy to play on guitar.  I remember when I was learning to play guitar in the mid-90's that all my other friends who were on the same path almost invariably started out by learning Nirvana songs; if I recall correctly, they're almost all just power chords. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not that Nirvana is unique to this kind of songwriting, but Cobain became an  <em>extremely</em>  influential and popular musician by basically writing songs that most people could play within a few months of learning the instrument. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's okay, though: a lot of my favorite songs are very, very simple, in a technical sense...and a lot of incredibly asinine music is highly technical.

      The only reason I know some music is because when you tab something on Powertab it transcribes it into Real musical notes above the tab.  Also "Every Good Boy Deserves Fries" and "FACE" plus my knowledge of where notes are on the neck gives me a reasonable but still sub-rudimentary ability to read Real music.

      i can semi relate as well. i was at a used bookstore and there's this ancient "Gold's Gym" weighlifting book. <br/> 
 <br/> 
there's some great stuff in it. it's black and white.. except it's that funky paper.. not news print,.. that other dirty harsh quality stuff.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
anyway, there's plenty o' funky pics. the book is a great laugh at parties. the Farah Fawcet hairdos on the chics (and some of the guys..) and the striped Dolphin shorts. so fucking classic.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
definitely gay by current standards. but guess what.. guys ripping down steroids to get ludicrously ripped and prancing and posing around on stage in Speedos?? please.. it's much worse than gay. it's the pigmallian complex shit.

      This seems like an inaccurate translation. The point he is trying to make is that the song is unoriginal and thus lacks merit. Actually playing an instrument is unnecessary and irrelevant. <br/>

Oddly that would also be much like my review of "Synecdoche, New York" from the other night. Except I don't have a star rating for it yet. I'm still trying to work it out. Too muddled to be truly great or too great to not be muddled? Can't call it yet.

      <em>Synecdoche</em>  has many flaws by conventional standards. But I think it is so personal a project, and so far beyond what most films try to accomplish that is really impossible to properly review. I think it is a work of sublime genius, and Charlie Kaufman is obviously much, much smarter than I am, and I don't feel qualified to try to say whether it failed or succeeded.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically it is operating on a much higher cognitive level than most other films.

(ohh yeah) <br/>

to something else <br/>

Its not entirely original, its kinda like a joke <br/>
