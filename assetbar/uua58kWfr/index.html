      A "ghost" slug found in a garden in Cardiff has been declared a new species by specialists at the National Museum of Wales and Cardiff University.  <br/>

Will some person who isn't lazy like me make an assetbar lolcat?  True to assetbar ego spirt, I only ask for 10% (every tenth) chubby.  I also assume the risk of every tenth lame.  I guess if I was a lawyer I would have to assume all lame risk, but would get 40% of the chubbies.

      It's sad. The Anheuser-Busch family have given so much to St. Louis for so many years, in terms of jobs and philanthropy and being one of the hallmarks of the town. They're the ultimate example of a moral corporation, and one of the only remaining good things in that city besides the Cardinals. And now they're being bought out and presumably outsourced because generosity and philanthropy isn't cost-efficient. Everyone in Missouri is really upset about it.

      sorry for replying to a random comment but I kinda want to keep distance from all the bad vibes further on down the page. :-P <br/> 
 <br/> 
so I hope I don't get hella lamed for saying this, but it seems that achewood is changing.  Changing for better or for worse depends on your perspective.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Shit, change is part of life, and there is this real strong urge that people have to fight chang, to lock in on a moment and mentally repeat it over and over, kind of like in that movie "Brain Candy" by The Kids In The Hall.  So maybe I am guilty of this.  Maybe I am going back and looking at old Achewood strips and I am wishing that things could be the way they were back then, when everything was a little simpler, a little more innocent, and when the future of both the Achewood strip and my own personal life was imagined to be a little bit unrealistically brighter than it has so far turned out to be.  Now the kids are all grown up and moved out... they never call anymore... I've graduated from school and I'm stuck in the real world... that sort of thing...  And Onstad has changed his story telling style... it has evolved...  and it has forced me to become aware of my own evolution... or something... I'm not sure what.... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am sure that when something is as much a part of you as Achewood is a part of many of us, to see it change in any respect, to see it go in any direction, will always evoke mixed feelings, just as happens when anything that is dear to us changes and evolves. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was just looking back at old strips which is something I haven't done in a long time.   <br/> 
here are two random examples, but there are lots more: <br/>

Those two come right after the most highly rated strip "Ray Gets Sort of Stoned", which I also personally enjoy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
These strips I'm referencing are somehow different than the strips we've been seeing lately. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that what was really part of the joy of these earlier strips was *not* knowing the characters, *not* having the characters being so fully developed... *not* having a defined framework, however surreal, in which the characters existed... the framework was plastic... In heaven one minute, hell the next... in Onstad's house, then moved out on their own, driving cars and operating Subway franchises. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The fact that the characters were not so fully developed kind of gave Onstad and also his readers a sort of creative liberty to imagine... more.  A more fully developed character, a more fully developed plot... what does it do?  It boxes you in, one bit at a time... it forces you to consider the implications of random inane shit within a context of the character and the plot, and therefore makes the cadence of your thinking a little less spontaneous and random and surreal.  I think the character and plot development is slowly pushing Onstad, one day at a time, slowly towards creating a different kind of Achewood.  Onstad is defining his own surreal and unlimited reality, only to be slowly finding his creation taking control of it's self. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I personally liked it better when the framework didn't really matter, when the humor in the strips was more self-contained in each strip, when there wasn't an unfolding drama... okay, there was always unfolding drama, but before, before it was surreal and preposterous... now... now it's... it's more real.  The characters are becoming more real.  And by real, I mean more realistic.  And this is a bit of a catch-22, because reality is boring, or even if not boring, reality can never end well.  Onstad is such a good writer and artist that if he keeps going down this tangent, I fully expect that Achewood may come to have all of the gravity and tragedy of a novel such as  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304232214/https://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/DicGrea.html">Great Expectations.</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Can Beef have an adventure like the one that Ray and Butters had, now that Beef's married?  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304232214/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=10022006">https://achewood.com/index.php?date=10022006</a> <br/> 
I guess that's the thing - there's a loss of abstraction and surrealism lately, in Achewood...  All the serious issues of life - relationships, marriage, and kids... I would personally like to see them dealt with on a more abstract and surreal level, dealt with in code, if you will. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The wedding in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304232214/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froth_on_the_Daydream">L'Ecume Des Jours</a>  was far more Achewoodesque than what I've seen so far in Beef & Molly's wedding.  A small sample: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em><br/>
In front of Colin, attached to the wall, you could see Jesus on a large black cross.  He appeared happy to have been invited and watched all of this with interest.  Colin held Chloe's hand and smiled vaguely at Jesus.  He was a little tired.  The ceremony was very expensive for him, fifty hundo doublezons so he was content at it being a success.<br/>
<br/>
There were flowers all around the alter.  He liked the music being played in this moment.  He saw in front of himself the Clergyman and recognized the tune.  Then, he gently closed his eyes, he leaned forward a little bit and he said: "Yes."<br/>
<br/>
Chloe said "Yes" as well and the Clergyman vigorously shook their hands.</em></div> <br/>

      i think it can be Agreed that Onstad will indeed consider this (as he already has, i'm certain) well into the morning hours, turning in his bed like a door on its hinges. first on his left side, then on his right side and then his left side again.

      This is a level of seriousness and analysis that deserves being in some French journal, but which is perhaps a bit much for an American comic strip.  C'mon man, where's the fun?  Just be on the journey with us and with the author and see where it goes.

      thanks for the kind comments but all I have there is the rough outline of some ideas.  I'm glad if some of it is interesting but I'm sure others could write better than I have.  yeah maybe I am crazy to take it so seriously, but I think that this strip really is, in some respects, on a par with some great literature.  And it's fun!   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It must be weird for Onstad to have so many people micro-analyzing what he's doing.  I wonder what effect, if any, that has had on the direction of Achewood.  I know if I was him that I would probably let it mess with my head in some way or other.

      With respect, Pogo, for a guy who makes it his cause to keep topics on topic, I feel it's somewhat prickish of you to knock fasteddie's level of 'seriousness'.  His critique was insightful, witty, and entirely relevant to the current story arc.  And while I understand your desire to keep things lighter and not as dense as an issue of  <em><strong>Cahiers du cinema</strong></em> , c'mon.  We get very little decent criticism around these parts, and I'd like to celebrate the good stuff we get...instead of the usual peanut gallery interjections about "THESE KNIVES" or "DICK ABOUT TERMS" or "Philippe is five", funny tho they be.  Or Dr. Manflesh pictures of nude men with erections lying recumbent on a couch while their family members look on and beam expectantly.  Which everyone could have done without.

      You're probably not going to believe this, smilebuddha, but the lady and I were just looking at  <em>Cahiers du cinema</em>  (Film Notebooks) because we are getting back into the new wave films and Truffaut wrote some great essays in '57 and '58, and then carried his ideas out, as you may know.  But even Truffaut did not take himself too seriously and said he enjoyed all films. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, you are right, I was an anti-intellectual dick there for a moment.  I should have read the essay more carefully and crafted an appropriate response instead of brushing the whole effort off the bar and demaning a lap dance.

      It has been a fascinating process to see the strip evolve from disconnected non sequiters starring mysterious stuffed animals to something resembling a Russian novel, with phalanxes of complex characters interacting like crazy.  And however much we might revere the good old days, there is now no going back, any more than we can reclaim the innocence of our youth, before we knew about sex and death.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
What we can ask is that there be fewer arcs and more one-offs.  We can ask for more absurdity and less soap opera-ness.  We can even ask for new characters who aren%u2019t fathered by Ramses or related to Molly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I offer to you, my fellow travelers in this Through-the-Looking-Glass world, the thought that the time for deep analysis is not now, not during the relative youth of Achewood.  To me, the whole charm of the strip is that it is a process of becoming for both the author and the fans.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
We Achewooders have all had the opportunity to grow in self-awareness (a certain troll being the obdurate exception) during this process, with the ongoing discussion giving us a new dimension of feedback and fun, and to say %u201Cstop%u201D or %u201Cgo back%u201D or to try and predict the next bend in the mind of our creator seems futile and foolish to me.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Enjoy the ride, and if you must analyze, fine, but many of us will just go lah-lah-lah through the long passages and look for the NO at the end.

      Okay here is what you need to remember: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Bag means purse and purse means wallet. Kebab means gyro and chips means fries. Lemonade is carbonated, chocolate is real, blackcurrant is popular, and alcohol is legal. LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE YOU CROSS THE STREET. Also slag means slut and rubber means eraser rather than condom, but you may not have to deal with those terms as often as I did...

      My time in London I got harassed by a couple 16 yr old punks with  <strong>fucking studded bracers</strong> .  I had just bought a nice cashmere over coat the day before and thought I had 60 quid in my pocket.  I didn't though, and I realized also they did not have knives.  So, I was like 'fuck off.'  They tried some Chuck Norris side kick at me that I deftly avoided but before I made it to the flat (right cross the street luckily)  they  <strong>bracered</strong>  me in the back of my ear.   <em>But they were totally frightened by my affected British F-bomb (V-bomb?)!!  Then they pretended they knew someone in my building that would kick my ass, but the V-bomb scared them off Buffy the Vampire (original movie) style.  (Can't enter the threshold of a buildin' for some reason.)  <br/>
<br/>
[i]Originally I wanted to be all chummy with 'em; Looking for speed.</em>   My sister had met an African emigre but his connexions were 20 quid a pop so... <br/>

It was pretty fun.  But I still have a weird cracky jaw thing in the cold months...

      I think neither.  They use kebab to refer to a dish derived from doner kebab, a Turkish dish made from slices of meat that has been roasted on a vertical spit, while we use it to refer to roasted meat on a stick, which is a different Turkish dish also called kebab.  Both are perfectly valid.

      Perhaps someone knows the answer to a question that has been bugging me for awhile...Canadians use the word hoser, and many places in the US use the word hoosier (usually meaning townie or ignorant local or chav, etc..not meaning a person from Indiana).  It would seem likely that these words share a common origin, but what is that origin?

      Damn, I just had to google image that flag and I got one that took up the whole screen and I just sat there and tried to find the angry dudes. The red in the flag was hurting my eyes and then I found them! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thank you. I shall always remember it and tell people about it. I might go to my old high school and see if my English Lit. teacher (he's Canadian) is still there and point it out to him. I'll walk in to his classroom and to the flag he always has up and say; "See the two angry men with their foreheads pressed against each other?" Maybe I'll draw faces to make it more noticeable, then I'll leave and never return.

      This strip is just so heartwarming. An elderly couple holds hands, a cat is nervous and also excited about spending the rest of his life with another cat, and Ray offers some gentle support. Someone is to be married this day, and Ray and Roast Beef will be there together,  <em>as friends.</em>  After reading this I feel like I can do anything. I'm going to marry you Jessica, <strong>today</strong>  is the day I ask for your hand.  <strong>Tomorrow</strong>  is the day I put it in the fridge and ask you to be my wife.

      In my experiences (and my wedding), it's not as exciting.  We all sat around, made awkward conversation because Grandpa was in the room, and waited til it was time to walk out.  Every now and again a guy gets pulled out to go run a superfast errand because the bride (or her crazyass mother) needs something.  We are chill, then walk out there, and go through the motions we practiced the previous day.  It's basically a day with less stress than work, but more than most weekends.  Also, since the bride gets all worked up over the wedding, wears out, and didn't sleep, hot wedding night sex is a thing single people imagine.

      My experience was different. My bride and I went with our respective families the night before (bachelor/ette parties were the previous weekend) and I went and got everything moving and rolling while she got her hair and makeup done.  By the time everything was sorted she had arrived, we said hi for a couple minutes and then we both got dressed.  Our honeymoon location for the first night was only 2 hours away so we got there at 10:30 after a very good party where we made SURE we got to eat the food we paid for, and had GREAT wedding night sex (twice).  You just have to make sure that you make the wedding about having fun getting married and not about stressing out about a giant party.

      If you're talking about  <em>Requiem For A Dream</em>  and that scene where the guy gets his arm amputated then yes. Also if that movie had actually been called  <em>Drugs Are Really Bad For You</em>  and there was actually a scene where some doctors surgically removed a turd that was hanging out of his ass that movie would have won the Oscar for best movie for the next five years and retroactively for the previous twelve.

      It is well known in the history of American popular music that when Dylan "went electric" it was seen by some (many?) as a betrayal. <br/>

I read somewhere that when Bob Wills played the Grand Ole Opry with a full drum kit in the band, he was booed off the stage.  People get attached to certain traditions, and they resent people (visionaries, in some cases) who transcend the traditions.

      Man I've been an Achewood fan since old times as well, but I gotta disagree with the assessment here. I've been concerned during this whole wedding storyline that what you're saying is actually happening, but I think there's a very fine line in between "jumping the shark" and actually pulling off sentimental events like this with class and success. I think Onstad has walked that line successfully so far because all these wedding strips have a lot of nuance that goes way beyond the whole sort of cheesy TV sitcom structure of the whole event. <br/> 
Plus I think marriage, and the wedding ceremony itself easily lend themselves to a gigantic cheesy sentimental circle-jerk. I kinda feel like Onstad's having to deal with the nature of marriage itself as an obstacle to doing good work here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think after the wedding is over Achewood will settle into a more usual routine. Just sayin, you got something of a point, but its not gonna last forever. <br/>

      i agree we dont need to give up hope, the wedding is kind of inherently cheesy, and that might explain why lately i feel like i come away with a worthwhile frame or two each week, rather than the consistently strong, surprising strips of days past.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
also, things just change, bands i used to like change their sound, slowly get worse, fall apart, nothing lasts for ever. thats totally understandable, and chris has an incredible body of work to be proud of. and no one can be criticized for losing their touch... look at what stevie wonder has done in the last 20 years, measured against his early career.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
but, unfortunately, its not that simple. i too suspect that the growth of achewood the business has much to do with the change in style and quality, and i too find that regrettable. and i shudder to think that chris reads these message boards, or is exposed to the kind of feedback that predominates here. it makes sense that the people who like the strip the most will want to post and interact, fair enough. but it probably creates a poisonous environment for creativity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chris, if by any chance you do read through this stuff, please go away, and never come back. you dont need all of us to do what you do.

      im worried that post makes it sound like i think chris has lost his touch. i dont. there has been alot of excellent stuff so far this year.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
what i was trying to say, and didnt say well, is rather than losing his touch, i think the bogged down story lines and rapid strip-consumer item product development etc are not helping things, and im nervous about the way the content of the strip is so closely linked to his livelyhood. hopefully someone will nominate him for a MacArthur grant or something, so he can focus on his family, and just be creative. I think he deserves that.

      If you are going to use 'jump the shark' as a point of reference, then you need to get its definition right.  From the originating site, "It's a moment. A defining moment when you know that your favorite television program has reached its peak. That instant that you know from now on...it's all downhill. Some call it the climax. We call it 'Jumping the Shark.' From that moment on, the program will simply never be the same."   <br/> 
So, if you are going to talk about this strip jumping the shark, you need to state the exact moment you feel it did so.  Personally, I do not feel that moment has occurred yet.

      I think it's the best method we have for encouraging the ignoring that must be done.  Many people naturally want to respond to the trolling, but I think it's much better if no one does.  Any lames I have distributed for that or any other occasion are nothing personal.

      Remember those adorable troll dolls you used to collect as a kid? Their hair came in lots of crazy colors, sometimes it was even rainbow colored! They even came with little outfits. I had one that was dressed as a angel that I insisted on hanging from the Christmas tree. My mom always made me put it at the back of the tree so as not to clash with the carefully hung gold ribbons and antique hand-blown ornaments.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Eventually, we forgot about these toys. We tossed them in a box in the closet along with our collection of Beanie Babies and McDonald's prizes. We forgot about them, but the trolls did not forget about us.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sometime in the late nineties, a wave of internet pranks led to the suicides of thousands of young internet users all over the country. It was not widely reported in the press because of fear of copycats. The deaths of these users was traced to their participation in internet forums and chat rooms. No one knows what exactly triggered the killings, but on every site connected with the death of a victim, a crypt message appeared. It was an image of a shock of blue hair with the word "DELICIOUS" above it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is no proof that the forgotten troll dolls were involved in the suicides, but campaigns of refusal to acknowledge all inflammatory posts in several internet communities has dramatically reduced the number of internet related deaths. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So remember kids, we are all here to have a good time, so keep it safe for everyone and DON'T FEED THE TROLLS. <br/>

      I'm with Pogo.  Nothing being said to the underagers here is remotely illegal, and I'm of the mind it isn't across the line.  I'm oddly careful about it, so I won't be flirting with catgrl, but she seems to find it funny, and tends to play along well.  Hell, I imagine it's irritating that the under-18 girls here are allowed to have all the dirty grownup conversations except one.  They've shown they can handle the naughtiness of the board. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do agree with the bald, skinny girl with the big education.  This really isn't a PC-thing, it's a 'don't molest kids' mindset that makes everyone paranoid.  I do think it's overly paranoid, but I think that's where they are coming from.

      Thanks, botman.  "Chester the Molester" is someone to be shunned and scorned, for sure, and being PC has nothing to do with being against child exploitation.  I salute the Internet providers who have recently agreed to shut down any chat rooms where child porn is exchanged and to turn over the names of users who traffic in such corruption.  However, Achewood is not a molestation networking site and never will be.  Let us be free to make awful jokes and crude references without fear of actually being taken seriously.

      I, for one, only really hated the ridiculous blocks of bullshit that had absolutely nothing to do with the conversation.  On some occasions, when you were vaguely on-topic, I found you to be a bit funny (in a way).   <br/> 
     Overall, I'm left wondering why you even bothered to come back, time and again, to shit all over something you obviously couldn't stand reading in the first place?  Sounds like a lot of boring work to put out something that just as obviously wasn't  <strike>appreciated</strike>  wanted here in the first place. <br/>

      "And my axe" is from comments on the strip from 6/4/08 <br/> <br/> <br/> There, now you're in on the joke. Quit bitching. <br/> <br/> <br/> Nah, I'm just kidding. Honestly it isn't that AssetBar posters hate "intelligent criticism", as you put it -- it is that  <em>nobody</em>  thinks that you're spurting of vulgarities and idiocy under different usernames is funny. Or interesting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Really, it's just annoying to see stupid crap like that (which you call a performance, despite the fact that you kept no character, you merely acted more like an asshole than usual) anywhere. It isn't funny to anyone, therefore no one is going to give you any credit.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
You don't deserve any type of kudos for your "universal intellectual concepts" -- and you really come off as a prick for giving them such a title. I am glad to see you go, especially after seeing your twisted, self-righteous reasoning behind your childish behavior. <br/>

      Going to try and be brief about this: <br/> 
This troll (and I mean that endearingly) is quite good and I can appreciate what he is saying on an artistic level.   <br/> 
Just a couple small points: <br/> 
Dr Manflesh and this troll are two completely different animals.  Dr Manflesh is not a character in Dr Manflesh's posts.  Perhaps Dr Manflesh's posts are self-serving, but they do not come across that way.  This troll's posts are always about the desire to shock, the desire to inspire a reaction, and the desire for interaction which is self serving if only to test his own limits.   <br/> 
But in America today, self serving is pretty much the order of the day, so while he might not fit on this forum, he fits perfectly in society.  So, try as he might he still never broke any new ground.   <br/>

      As a more serious response, I am enjoying it so far.  I don't know if it is actually worth the fee at this point, but I think it's something a devoted achewood fan would do well to consider.  The discussion is not yet nearly so fun as here in the open Assetbar, but maybe when a "critical mass" is reached, it will also be cool.  Or there will be uncontrolled nuclear fission, which would probably cause me to opt out.

      One day, Mokou was out shopping with the neet. They drank a lot of lemonade and had to piss, so they went to the bathroom together. While Mokou was doing her business, the neet stuck her head under the stall divider. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"So what do you think of that new dress? Shit is so cash, right?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Kaguya, you can't do that!" Mokou screamed. "Get out!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mokou started kicking the neet in the face, but the neet braved the pain and slithered under the divider and into the spacious stall. The neet carefully squirmed her arm under Mokou's leg and began to finger her. This caused Mokou's piss stream to intensify, a golden torrent rivaling a fire hydrant. The piss was powerful enough to knock down the stall door, sending it crashing into the far wall. Picking Mokou up by her underarms, the neet carried her around as a mobile piss cannon, blasting holes in walls and ripping apart innocent shoppers in a wall of hot urine. When Mokou was finally exhausted, the pair stood in the ruins of the mall, knee--deep in a golden lake. Piss mixed with shoppers' blood rained down from what was left of the ceiling. Too embarrassed to even move, she offered no resistance as the neet shoved her head underwater and drowned Mokou in her own piss. The neet whipped out her cell phone and called Cirno, informing the fairy of a whole new lake that just formed that she can play in. <br/>

      :) thank you!  But you are avoiding the question plummet...  There are hints of connections between you and Manflesh...  You just posted something that Manflesh would exactly post.  Did you do so by accident using the wrong account...?  Your avitar is from an Magna-type cartoon (do I have the terminology right?) and by tracing his last post higher up the page I discovered that Manflesh is associated with a group of web cartoonists...
