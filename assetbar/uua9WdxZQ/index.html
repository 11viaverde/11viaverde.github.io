I can only hope for that sort of income, although given what a public schoolteacher makes these days I'd  be better off teaching poor kids how to swim.

      Since most popular songs are simply several repeated bars of a relatively small number of chords, tabs are a much simpler way of representing how to play the song than staff notation.  It's also a lot easier to pick up than staff notation and doesn't require much in the way of teaching or explanation, so people without experience in other instruments can play songs easily without having to learn things like time signatures, clefs, accidentals and so on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or if you don't buy that, "guitar players are dumb" works as an explanation too (this includes me)

      Meh. Last time I got a distinction was back at Grade 6. I only just passed the Grade 8 when I did it... but I put that down to a board change from Associated Board to Trinity... which... was annoyingly more difficult. Still, I'd say I was lucky to have never failed an exam, so... is all fine.  <br/> 
Good on you for getting all those distinctions. ^_^ <br/>

      Today's your lucky day - each of the lines is a string on the guitar. Each of the numbers is the fret that you hold the string down at. ... The end. To get more in-depth, each of the frets on each string represents a note in various octaves (is that right? how loud it is?) and rather than writing it out where all the notes you would be hitting are represented it just tells you where to put your fingers on which string. Entry-level stuff! :D

      Most guitar sheet music does, in fact, have a treble clef and notes.  Only the stuff you find on the Internet is written in tab.  Tab's easier to learn, but more limiting.  Tab's pretty simple anyway--the six lines represent the six strings, time moves from left to right.  When you see a number in a certain position, it means "play this fret on this string at this time".

      Guitar tab has a major advantage over staff notation; there are many ways to play the same note on a stringed instrument. Staff notation is fine for pianos and horns but  <em>where</em>  you play the notes on a guitar changes both tone and difficulty. I can sight-read tab but I have to think about where everything goes (that's what sh..  <strong><em>smack!</em></strong> ) when I'm reading staff notation. A lot of guitarists also use different tunings so staff notation is pretty hopeless in that case. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, most tab has no rhythmic or fingering information so good sheet music also includes staff notation.

      tab is a way for anyone [including people with no musical training at all] to be able to pick up a guitar and play a song. unfortunately, this makes those people think they are musicians. it's a great tool to get kids playing songs quickly, but it only hinders them later on when they want to learn more about music [for example in the music theory class i teach at my high school] and they realize that they have to learn how to read actual notation on the staff.
