I think what did it for me is the Wonderbread bag with 6' ext cord fastener memory, and some of the other visions from Roast Beef's life.  That someone with a broken past can reach the sublime, and that nothing else really matters that much.  Roast Beef would not have dared to dream about this, but he got it.  Something went really really right in the world. <br/>

I also liked the part with Ray covering for Philippe.  Such a fatherly gesture, which is both surprising and expected from Ray.

      The moments from Beef's life flashing before his eyes as his bride walks up the aisle are sincerely fucking poignant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wish we knew more about Molly before she was in heaven. What was she seeing? Was she married in life before? What fucked up things happened to her that this seems like a good decision? Not that Beef isn't amazing. But it takes a special girl with a special, secretive past to really want to be with a guy who has to take special precautions and lamps and rituals in order to leave the house or address people in public in a polite manner.

      I'm not the one who lamed you, but maybe it's because there are already like five posts on here to the effect of "anyone who didn't rate this a five suxorz", just like on  <em>every single other strip</em> . Such comments and the ensuing discussions contribute nothing, and given that the range is something like 4.3-4.8, the ratings are basically meaningless anyway. Just rate it whatever the hell you want and move on already.

      It's been stated by others than myself, but the best clear purpose of the ratings is really that the highest rated up top give achewood virgins some really good places to start.  In this it has succeeded, although I imagine that if this strip stays up there it's gonna confuse some people down the road. <br/>

Also, that complaint always sounded really whiny to me. <br/>

      Um, point. If you don't like the strips and don't like rating the strips then just...don't....rate....the....strips? Am I right? Refrain? I sincerely doubt Mr Onstad has the time or inclination to read our comments, and I'm sure he doesn't really care what strip is rated highly or by who, but it's a forum for us,  and so mocking the general use of it just seems a little bit silly. Why not use it if it's there for us to use?

hamscout, have you been paying attention at all to the exponential growth of this site's fanbase? Shit, there's something like 2000 comments on that page you just linked alone. I don't know about many of you, but I'm terribly busy what with getting laid and German yacht parties and snow-blading (new sport I invented with the Swiss) all the time, so maybe I simply can't read every damn comment on every page every day. Plus, I've been here a little over two years now. Follower for three. Most of these other users, probably at least a year.  <br/>

It was at a sci-fi convention attended for reasons of necessity and duty. Also present was Mon Mothma and three people dressed as Jack Sparrow, one obese. I recommend these fine events to all- don't forget to watch the interview with the fish guy from Hellboy, you may learn something as I did.

Molly looks so much cuter in that flashback panel. I guess a lot of cartoonists struggle to make their female characters beautiful while maintaining a consistent style, but it's unnecessary. Giving Molly a "realistic" neck isn't going to make us like her any more than we already do.

      It's a temporary change for the wedding which gives her a much more elegant look. I don't think Onstad is trying to get us to "like her any more than we already do"  so much as he's making her look how someone getting married wants to look. <br/> 
Also it really helps set her apart from her mother who's got, basically, the exact same face.

      I don't know what kind of Shakespeare the internet deserves, but this is the one we get and I couldn't be happier. Onstad you marvellous bastard! Who else could make an extended webcomic arc based on a marriage, not only one that doesnt make you vomit in your own mouth, but actually be freakin' hilarious, beautiful and still mannish enough to capture the terrible dudes that come here every day to realise there is more twisted genius in the world than our low-fi lives suggest.

      Congratulations Pogo! <br/> 
Still working on my first, and I will say this from my own experience.  My wedding was a disaster, and it haunted the first few years of my marriage.  However, my marriage has been a success because we had a strong enough bond between us.   <br/> 
I think many folks have criticized this arc because they do not understand the circumstances.  Go back and read and watch the bond between Beef and Molly in all their strips together, and you will begin to have an idea.

      Man, I was right. The Passenger does flow real nicely with this. You just have to read it very slowly, savouring it and imagining what is happening and reminiscing on what has happened. It is so perfect that I timed it so that Iggy would start singing on that first zoom in on RB's face, and then sang through out the flashbacks. So perfect.

      The part in minor?  Hmmmm.  I see Roast Beef's whole life as a bit more like the 4th ballade, the wedding like the second movement of the 1st concerto. <br/>

Also, I just was watching some show, and they said that at the end of Blade Runner, it actually wans't supposed to be raining.  I find that unbelievable, given the line that you referenced.

      Even though we know that Molly and Beef's time together will end in tears, it takes nothing away from the fact that the little cat from circumstances finally gets a moment of genuine happiness. <br/>

This reminds of the strip The Future, when someone joked that it would be the last Achewood ever. If Onstad did plan to just stop, this would probably be the way to go out. <br/> 
I'm sure he won't though. Pre-pretty sure.

      With further reflection, I have these points to add... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Phillipe's mouth opens up like butterfly wings. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray is has his expectant face on just after Molly arrives, I really like this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mr Bear needs to say it not spray it. <br/>

Beef has lost all the tone from his skinny, junkie like arms. <br/>

      The Black Keys are awesome. Same time though, probably the best songs they recorded was their EP of Junior Kimbrough covers. Especially "Meet Me In The City" and "My Mind Is Ramblin'." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am the king of playlists, however. In terms of something for hardrockin' and bootknockin' you cannot surpass "All Hands Against His Own."

      Can I say how awesome it is that so many people listen to the Black Keys? When I first got into those motherfuckers, you couldn't even find their lyrics online. My best friend and I went to see them play in San Francisco four or five years ago, and we didn't have to wait in line, and there were so few people when we got there that we just went right up to the stage. I have been trying to spread the gospel and get them rich this whole time and now all of a sudden they are opening for Radiohead and everyone on Assetbar has a favorite song. What I'm saying is: I take personal responsibility for every speck of their popularity.

      Yea, when I read a music-related thread my eyes pretty much start to glaze over at the point that I realize that it will not in any way relate to medieval battles, sorcery, death and destruction, or fantasy creatures. Why would you want to sing about anything else? <br/>

      You can go to metal shows that I approve.  Growling is okay, but too much screaming is not.  If they abuse triple-kicks, it is not okay.  Slipknot is never okay. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for loneal, of course you can play with her.  You can dress her up, stick wigs on her, pose her in all sorts of ways.  I'm thinking of getting the 1950s housewife kit to go with her, so we can show her cleaning the house and baking pies and pregnant and such.  It'll be so much fun!

      She made it clear that it was her aspiration to be the Vile Country Woman in every mildly misogynistic blues song, leavin behind many a no-account fool who could fit his tiny dick into his empty wallet and didn't have nuthin but a guitar and the wherewithal to string some rhymes together. She liked the "Leavin Trunks" but had neither the time nor the sentimentality for "The Lengths," 'cause that's just how a Vile Country Woman is: always strollin down the train tracks with her often-sought-after but rarely-attained pussy, not that she withheld it from men oh no it is just that she knew where to find plenty of strapping, muscly intellectuals to bed with for several nights and still have room in her schedule to fit the insincere cunnilingus her feminism demanded of her. But meanwhile the last man she left is makin his money and improvin his art with the songs she didn't like, boredly bonin many a groupie, turning on a switch in his mind that made him think of his lost Vile Country Woman's swishin ass so he can cum and get whatever tiny screamin girl that has stumbled into his hotel room to stumble the fuck back out; recording a whole platinum album founded the long hazy memory of that seven-month fling, searchin in vain but can't find a country woman as vile as her or a vile woman as country as her, layin awake at night wonderin if she ever found a man that she could ever settle down with, but hopin she hasn't and never will not just out of bitterness but so that the winds might carry her into his arms for just one more night. He wouldn't even bother playin the new songs he'd written for her because they wouldn't keep her around any longer than she planned to stay, and after what she did he doesn't owe her another damn note. It is all he can tell himself to believe he's his own man now. The best lie he's got is sayin "Naw these songs wasn't for you." And if he said they were, she'd just zip that pussy right back up and be on her way down those tracks even faster than before. 'Cause that's just how a Vile Country Woman is.

      Thank you Chris, for not only creating one of the best, most heartwarming AND funniest strips in Achewood's run, but also creating the first strip that can probably never ever be transcribed. <br/>

Although I won't be happy unless there is more Achewood. This would be a nice note to end it on, but at least give us an epilogue. Shit, even the Wonder Years had an epilogue. Don't just pull a Dinosaurs on us and spring the Ice Age on Achewood. <br/>

      <em><strong>Heyo! Decent Idea Alert!</strong></em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pogo's point, as far as I understand it, is that this strip is essentially 47 panels of "Hey, folks. Beef got over  <em>all this crap</em>  to get where he is. Right now, everything's perfect!" It doesn't need to be a Huey Lewis song for it to be a bit saccharine. Consider this strip compared to Achewood strips in the past. There's a certain lack of the usual comical absurdity here.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, if you compare it to other comics and works, there is certainly a modicum of absurdity present. Todd and the cigarette, the idea itself of cats getting married, et cetera. But that is absurd in the same sense that the animals talking in  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Get Fuzzy</span>  are absurd. It's only absurd in considered in a different construct; within the constructs of the universe, it's reasonable and even a bit bland. As the universe becomes larger and larger, the comic becomes less groundbreaking and more stagnant. A higher-class Garfield for a smarter audience.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The point is similar to what fasteddie was saying yesterday. The universe itself is creating a prison for the characters. It's what bested Bill Watterson and what has sapped much of Berke Breathed's humor and tact. When a good (or even merely decent) writer begins a long-running absurd work, their best output tends to be at the beginning, before the world of their work has a chance to impose itself as a roadblock to their creativity. All authors try to get around it in a different way. Some succeed, as Camus did when he wrote short vignettes instead of long. And some, like Gogol, just go crazy trying to write long stories and end up dying horrible deaths.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The point is that Achewood used to be a veritable theater of the absurd. It isn't anywhere close to that, not anymore. Some may like it more, some may like it less. But there is no denying that time has produced quite a different Achewood than that of years past. And, yes, some of us do miss when Achewood was a burgeoning absurdist piece that asked more questions than it answered, a work of comedic art that held no peerage in the genre. And, I mean, I liked this strip. Missing the past doesn't mean we don't enjoy or appreciate the now. But we sing Auld Lang Syne all the same.

      Hmmm, I feel like the last 10 days of March were of the absurd flavor.  The Shrovis-Bishipthorpe caper? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can appreciate the difference in the flavor, though.  Those ones from 2001 are so short and sweet sometime.  That was almost never recaptured.  And there are so many classics around 2005, I think.

      While I applaud you for writing so well for a point that many refuse to hear, I have some addendums. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't feel that Achewood necessarily was an absurdist comic. The very beginnings were, and I'm not going to lie, they weren't the best. They were surprising of course, but not always good. And the longer it goes there is less for the author to surprise us with. But then, to me, Achewood came to its most satisfying part - when it was a character piece. By the time we all knew the characters, and most importantly, Onstad knew the characters, their interactions became the highlight of the comic. I think the interactions between Ray and Roast Beef became an art form in an of themselves. But of course you need a funny, surprising topic to talk about. So I would say Achewood isn't suffering from lack of absurdity, it is suffering a lack of original ideas for the characters to react around. Lately it's been all the wedding, or random crap (Shrovis-Bishopthorpe was not great, to me). I hope once the wedding is over, it will go back to surprising us with situations, and entertaining us with the characters.

      Damn, I know you don't  <em>hate</em>  each other, lady. ('Specially after that fine fuckin' you be givin' each others, AMIRITE?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
But it makes it more comical and increases your weekly viewership if there's sexual tension bubbling underneath genuine disdain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's nice of him to teach you such things and to give you a basement, his own basement no less.  It shows how much he cares.  A lady needs to know how much her man cares about her.  How he needs to watch her, keep track of her, make sure nobody hurts her, make sure she doesn't hurt  <em>herself</em> .  Sometimes, of course, the man has to hurt her in order to keep her from future pain, like if she was going to leave him.  No no, that won't do.  Not if you truly love the lady.  She has to learn, you know?  Yeah, I know you know.  Unlike Jenny, you understand.  Jenny never understood.  It's a shame she never can now, but not as much of a shame as if she kept Not Understanding.  I'm sorry for it, but my dad always said you have to do what has to be done, you know?  Yeah, you know.

      Given that I was lamed into the dark zone for the first time in a while up above, I feel I should break character just for a sec. <br/> 
 <br/> 
People, loneal and I have been doing this faux-creepy thing for like, months here.  She was the only non-tripod to respond to my creepitude early on, so she got the brunt of it since.  Something about how she screwed something up and I told her I was going to kill a guy on Lost and steal her hair, and it got going from there.  She recently said something about being kidnapped and held in my basement.  So I posted something about taking her teeth away, and I think I lost some of the audience. <br/>

Seriously, it's just online assholery.  We haven't met in real life, and if we did she'd laugh her ass off at my one-legged, 600 pound bulk.  She enjoys the rigamarole as much as I do, and you could ask her yourself if I took my sock out of her mouth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Awwww, it's okay.  He don't ejaculate none."

      In reality you could outrun me.  Like I've said, I'm over 600 lbs and the government was careless with my leg once so I have to hop everywhere.  Also my fingernails are too long for me to grasp things. You are a youthful dancer-type who could elude me without even meaning too.  It would be comical in a bad way.  I'm more of a 'lure you in' sort of guy.  Did I mention that I have the singer/guitarist from the Black Keys in this hole here?  That's right, Dan Auerbach, in his skivvies, right at the bottom of this brick-lined pit under my mansion.  Just hop on in, he won't mind.

      loneal I'm not going to speak for everyone on this board but here are the honest reasons I'd like you to shut the fuck up about it already: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. When I was fifteen, I had a  <strong>long distance</strong>  internet relationship that ended with my heartbroken  <em>because I told her I loved her.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. The girl I had a crush on freshman year in college  <em>dated my suitemate senior year.</em>  They stayed together for a while past graduation but then broke up because they couldn't handle a  <strong>long distance</strong>  relationship. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. But on the last night before graduation I tried to kiss the other girl I had a crush on throughout all of college but was rebuked because throughout all of college she had apparently been faithful to her boyfriend in fucking Canada. He was not made up, I met him. He is a really cool dude, therefore, I hate his guts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
4. I developed a crush on a girl at the office who wound up boning a dude at our New York office, and as far as I know they are still in a  <strong>long distance</strong>  relationship that is somehow working, probably because she can afford to visit him every weekend while I am scraping funds together living with my parents. <br/> 
 <br/> 
5. Bixtek Industries is doing  <em>smashingly</em>  on the NASDAQ despite expectations from industry insiders that it would fail. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And on top of that your witty banter with hedonismbot has all the makings of a romantic sub-plot to a bad Hollywood action movie. This is especially irritating to me as an aspiring writer and an internet nerd because I am starting to think that  <strong>long distance</strong>  relationships are central to understanding the zeitgeist of our generation.  <em>How am I supposed to win a Pulitzer when you're giving me Razzie material woman?!</em>

Hedonismbot and I don't have any sort of long-distance relationship. We live in the same house. <br/>

      In all honesty, I think his notion that the misreading of poetry can lead to the creation of great poetry is intriguing, as reported on wikipedia, but I have yet to actually subscribe to his newsletter. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He also seems to discount several schools of criticism that I think deserve to be taken seriously, calling them more interested in politics than what he considers real art. I'm skeptical. I suspect that his position is more nuanced than that, but I intend to investigate his criticism more fully once I've gotten through more of the fiction on my reading list.

      Things I love about this strip: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Panel 10 - Ray is walking in a determined fashion.  He knows his best bud is getting married, but he's going to be right there with him to the end. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Panels 13 & 17 -When they spot the bride, Beef is solemn, while Ray is astonished at her beauty.  He never imagined Molly this way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The flashback panels are pure gold.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Panels 27-29 - Love Beef's contented smile when Molly smiles at him and he recalls their first meeting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Panels 36-40 - Phillipe is obviously in a world of pain, but he delivers the goods.  He is relieved he has accomplished his task without mishap, but when he finally relaxes - Noooooo! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Panel 41 - Ray's concern for Phillipe's embarrassment is genuinely touching.  Ray is truly the most soft-hearted of hard-core partiers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All in all, a fitting pinnacle to all that is Achewood and all that has gone before.  It is obvious Onstad labored lovingly over every frame.

Anyway, there's a large aftermarket "dog-rodding" community for Aibos. I'm sure Ray just picked the tuxes up in one of their catalogs (go ahead and tell me they don't fill his mailbox with their catalogs). I'd be willing to bet that affixed to each Aibo's hindquarters, concealed by the tails of their jackets, is an ugly sticker that says something like "DOGBOT TECH" in a 'sleek' font. The two "T"s run into each other to suggest the upper part an Aibo's face; the rest of the head is sketched in beneath. <br/>

      Man, I don't know what's more embarrassing. That you fell back on that rather tired joke, that you don't know what "Niggardly" means, or that you automatically assumed that a word that vaguely resembles an ethnic slur against a person of African descent means "lazy".

      Okay, I am trying to figure this out, but I'm not sure I have it right. This is my version of what has happened here tonight: I_love_kate is responding to davey-boy and criticizing him for falling back on the "not funny, not cool" joke. I_love_kate does not know that the word "niggardly" means "lazy" and has nothing to do with any ethnic slur, and so he thought davey-boy was getting it wrong and being offensive while doing so. "Niggardly" remains a stupid word that no one would miss if we retired it from the English language. In conclusion, Colonel Mustard in the dining room with the candlestick.

      No, i-love-kate was refering to the davey-boy getting the definition of niggardly wrong. i_love_kate though that by incorrectly defining "niggardly" as lazy, davey-boy was purposely making a racist joke. Then, tekende thought that i_love_kate was refering to his comment. There may be some level of sarcasm in here that I am missing though. <br/>

      Okay, just to clear things up: I was making a joke in reference to another thread that I can't be arsed to look up right now. The one where someone (I think drskradley) made a reference to some song and said "Assetbar is the Nigger of the World" or whatever and someone else said "*gasp* You can't say  <em>nigger</em> " and the thread went pretty predictably from there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, then came the "not funny not cool" part up there, and then i_love_kate's response which seemed to me like it was directed at both of us and I don't even know anymore. Whatever guys.

      It seems odd to me that we assume Achewood must follow the same trajectory as a sitcom that was on TV before most of us were born. Maybe it's time to admit to ourselves that rather than being a real concept in narrative theory, 'jumping the shark' is just another web meme of dubious applicability to this particular webcomic.

      It depends whether you believe the content of the comic has deteriorated or not, I do not believe so, and it is too early to judge whether this is the moment the strip "jumped". There may be a period of adjustment where strips following the wedding event may not have the emotional charge that many so obviously feel about this arc. I have faith that the following strips will be of a quality that will maintain the standards of excellence this strip so often meets. Whether they are greeted as such by the readers remains to be seen.

      I don't follow your reasoning. I see "jump the shark" used when a series begins a downward spiral that it never recovers from. Going by that definition, the term could be reasonably applied to any form of media. Now, many series may go into a slump and recover, and I don't think those are true JTS moments. But then there are plenty of series that go bad and never recover. I don't see why it should be applied to Achewood now, but I don't see why it couldn't apply if Achewood permanently drops in quality.

      I know it was mentioned further up, but I will try to calm the late-comers and can't-be-bothered-to-read-more-that-two-posts-types by stating that this isn't the end of Achewood, or the end of this arc, or even a descent to overly-sweet pap.

      I did, I gave it a 4.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
   I try and use the rating system as it should be and not give every thing a 4 or 5. That's right, I give strips a rating of 2 or even 1 occasionally, a Achewood 1 is still better than most online comics.  <br/> 
   What you need to do is think about the least successful non-guest artist strip for your baseline 1, then your absolute favorite strip, that is your 5 everything should pretty much fall in between. <br/> 
   This is, to me at least, not the best strip ever. I like it a lot, but I feel that there  <em>are</em>  better strips, strips that make me laugh more, strips that push the medium more, strips that have a finer sense of art-direction, strips that have an element of surprise.  <br/> 
   I stand back and observe and then render my opinion. However just remember that opinions are like clitorises... and I am entitled to my opinion as to how the rating system should work and where this strip  should fall in said rating system. <br/>

      The two step look of surprise on the premium updates membership banner ad on achewood.com.  Is that from a strip?  Anyway, that's a good Philippe face, too.

      I feel that it is important to note that Beef does not smile in the strip until he remembers the first time he met Molly. Hell of sweet man. It' like, even though he had a rad friend like Ray, there is a certain kind of happiness that could only be brought on by Molly.

      Agreed. I've come back to this strip several times over the last 24 hours and it keeps hitting me in powerful ways -- I mean, yes, it's just an internet comic strip, but I've stuck with these characters probably more than I have just about any other piece of pop culture in the past decade and to keep all these different story arcs and characters going and developing, and with such an arc (or series of arcs) to it is damn incredible, and really I think the collected works of Achewood are nearly Dickensian in scope and use of language and so on. I don't know who Onstad reads in his spare time but I would add that there is something very much of the Mr Biswas from VS Naipaul's "A House for Mr Biswas" in the character of Roast Beef ... essentially two dudes from circumstances, hit hard by depression, who make good at the end. Let's just hope this isn't the end.

      I'll try to explain it using small words.  You lamed her for simply not agreeing with you.  She did not say anything mean.  She did not post an image of a girl punching her dad's cock.  You lamed her out of spite, because you are childish.  That is what her post was about. <br/>

There is something genuinely wrong with you.  The strip is beautiful, and someone has a genuinely emotional reaction (as I did), and you react this way... why?  Shedding a tear because something beautiful pulled at something in you is  <em>lame?</em>

      No, it's a big beautiful world out there and there are a lot of things that pull at me, but it's just silly for anyone to think this series of images had much merit at all, much less get all choked up about it.

      Oh my God, Lainestin, I just Googled you and it was awesome. Don't worry, I don't have a problem with short guys, I am shorter than you by a couple inches. I also don't have a problem with guys who play online games like UO; my first boyfriend was really into WoW, and it was cute. Neither of us want kids, both of us like LOST. We even live just a few hours away from each other! I see why you have been following me around so obsessively now. We are basically a match made in heaven.

      Oh, I think you have gotten the wrong idea! Do not worry! I wasn't criticizing your following me around obsessively. I've already said having my lames become meaningless is awesome, and I know you saw that, because you lamed it. Searching for every instance of my name on every page of Assetbar so you can click a link under each comment is a  <em>little</em>  obsessive, though, dear. Almost by definition. I try to keep a harem of obsessed boys available at all times, though, so this ain't nothing particularly exciting or new. Welcome to Assetbar, tiny machine elf!

      You do know that all I had to do was look at your profile to see all of your comments, right? It is not like I was scrolling down every list of comments looking for your name. It is very easy for someone to follow you around laming every comment you make, if they so desire to.

      (this is in reference to a post made about 7 or 8 up unfortunately) Every time I see the words "loving" and "caress" it makes me think of the SA forum filter that replaces "fuck" with "caress gently" and "fucking" with "loving". <br/>

      Of course this strip was "for the fans".  No one ignorant of Achewood could read this and understand a damn thing.  But that's not a cop-out.  That makes it rich and deep.  If you want a comic that's 100% non-self-referential, go read Garfield.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's nothing cryptic about this strip and if you couldn't figure out the panels then that speaks more to you than it does to Onstad.   <br/>

      One way in which it could have been better is if Onstad had focused this particular strip on beef and beef only, and had a separate strip with the other characters. Some of the sentimentality was spoiled because the strip went for too much.

      Show, don't tell. Don't explain with a mound of dialog what can be shown in a single frame. It's in the edit, in the sudden impact between two unrelated ideas, that the viewer really finds meaning. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My film teacher told us that the first day of class.  And Beef's series of flashbacks is one of the best examples I've ever seen, film or not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It says so much; he laughs at the J-cups, he's punched in the gut remembering the Wonder bag, and he's resigned himself to cry alone out on the corner... but then he sees how far he's come. Getting over his depression, dressing up like Lincoln to rap with his best friend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The sudden familiarity brings him back. Feeling unresolved, he thinks of Molly. He remembers the freedom of floating lonely in space. He remembers the freedom that brought him to Molly. The one person that matters most to him, the one person pushing him to be more than he ever was before. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And he smiles. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's so perfect, such a beautiful glimpse into the mind of some geeky, depressive cat. The instant roller-coaster of emotions as he scans over his loved ones and reflects on all the memories they've brought him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In all, my favorite nuance to this moment is seeing the calm wash over him. Everyone is looking at him. Everyone is thinking about him. This guy can't even buy  <em>groceries</em>  without a panic attack, but on this day, with all eyes on him... all he sees is Molly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is the best moment of his life to date, and we've got the Beef's-eye view. Beautiful, just beautiful.

Even if you don't think this strip is the best Onstad's ever created, you can 'Five' it for the significance of the event--for the culmination of all of the events/hardships/joys that brought Beef to this point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's the same reason we applaud after a wedding--we know the marriage won't be perfect, but we recognize that it is basically  <em>a thing</em> .

      I believe there's been some misunderstanding of the ter "fanservice." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will explain.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
As we all know fanservice is art designed to cause violent mastrubation.  This is a given, although the tentacles are optional <br/> 
 <br/> 
While I understand that pissing otters and babies in wonder bread sacks are a fetish for a substantial portion of our community (at least every member that uses the word fanservice) it is NOT considered sexually arousing by the majority, and was probably not placed in the strip for the specific purpose of violent mastrubation occuring.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hence, this strip is not fanservice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unlike the one where Lyle pukes on the football.

      I'm pretty sure they mean fanservice in terms of the author gratuitously giving his audience what they want to read as opposed to what he might feel is more befitting the character or circumstances. In this instance, it's because they probably feel like a pleasant wedding ceremony with no major cock-ups or drama is completely and unforgivably out of place given the character of Beef and the negative luck that he is normally afflicted with in the strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, what these people would much rather have seen with this strip is Gramma K, high as hell on crystal meth and  <em>hatred</em> , gunning down the still-smiling Beef from a nearby dugout as he goes in for his first wedded kiss with Molly, causing her to shriek in horror as her bridal whites are streaked with the lifeblood of her beloved. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That was just an example. It could also be something much better.

      I realize that this is probably a modification of an old folk song, but look at it another way: Beef gets killed so often that Molly now knows in advance that his life's blood is sticky as all hell, and will require extra scrubbing to get out.

      I'll say it.  He's not a good artist.  He can't draw well.  He conveys action well enough, and has great ideas for visual work (like cartilage head), but his technical ability is very weak.

      Solid.  I'm pretty sure he understands his shortcomings, and does things like that to work around them.  He's mentioned in interviews that he doesn't think he's great at drawing.  I appreciate that he doesn't try to hand-draw Keith Moon when he wants to convey Keith Moon.  He does what he needs to to get the humor and story across.

      He seems to really grasp how to express things, and the aisle bit is well composed, but I still think he lacks some technique.  Take those godawful collar bones for example.  A more experienced cartoonist would make them much clearer.  He's good enough to know that something elegant like that is nice, but not too great at making it happen.  Of course, the art quality is the least important part of Achewood.  It is less important than the trolls on the forums.

I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, <br/> 
But is there because he's a victim of the times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wear the black for those who never read, <br/> 
Or listened to the words that Jesus said, <br/> 
About the road to happiness through love and charity, <br/> 
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose, <br/> 
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes, <br/> 
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back, <br/> 
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black. <br/>

      The third, fourth, and fifth rows of this comic show are a pretty clear reminder of the depth of the characters, and are likely the most important thing Onstad has done with Achewood.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have watched people here make arguments about how this can, in a way, act as a prison for the author and the characters that eventually kills the story for the readership, but I'm going to disagree. If anything, those three silent rows demonstrate that everything we have watched over the years as fans has culminated into a meaningful relationship, not even between the characters, but between the reader and the characters. We draw the lines and make this story meaningful. Those rows are nothing without the relationship you've formed with Roast Beef. Some of us, seems like a lot of us, love Roast Beef almost as much as Ray does. That's a powerful tool for the author to have, and I really doubt that tool serves as the key to the cage.
