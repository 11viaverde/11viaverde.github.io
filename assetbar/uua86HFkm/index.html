      I think it has to do with Cornelius' Public School Brit sentiments when he's riled; as Borge was a Dane and Connery is a Scot, and although both are brilliant, they are common- therefore 2nd-Rate tools to be used as a metaphorical bludgeon against Teodor- <br/>

      You guys sound like the kids who, in the middle of a music theory class, will condescendingly laugh and state that Ravel and Beethoven is music for old white faggots clinging to a dead age, and then sneeringly show a video on your iPhones of an indie-punk band consisting entirely of heroin addicts who have developed the gimmick of pissing into each others' mouths onstage.

I haven't weighed in on this yet, but I checked out the above link and had a lukewarm reaction, not because he was old and white, but because he was not funny in that same way that old Vaudeville comedians or the kindly uncle who tells you the same jokes and does the "got your nose!" gag every time you visit are not funny. It's the kind of thing you'd need a mental time machine in order to appreciate. <br/>

      I remember that schtick. I'm sure Pogo and redphillip remember it too. We are of the  <em>Baby Boomer</em>  generation, children of the  <em>Greatest Generation.</em> <br/> 
Here is my take. <br/> 
 I hated it when I was a kid. No kid liked it because Victor Borge was not funny. Our parents patiently told us he was also a classical pianist of High Mind and Talent. This did not make that skit funny, but they thought it was uproarious. <br/> 
 They were of the Generation that had things much harder than us; and they told us that, again and again. They believed that with hard work, anything is possible. That was the credo of their generation. <br/> 
 If you notice, Mr. Borge works very hard in this skit to get all his  <em>silly punctuation noises</em>  arranged just so. <br/> 
 They recognized the hard work he put into this skit that was supposed to be humorous. Therefore they found it hilarious. We did not understand.

      See maybe it's just me, but because the sounds he was making were all very kind of squeaky and 'wet' and the story he was telling was about two young lovers I thought the joke was that all the punctuation sounded embarrassingly sexual.

      This post said it all.  Also, Mr. Bear (and by extension Onstad?) does not find it funny either, but old and tired like Sean Connery.  Mr. Bear is not old and tired. <br/>

In that video when you see the crowd laugh, you can see in their eyes that it is the controlled laughter of memories of when they laughed at this before.  Not the loss of control that comes with really letting your laughter flow to the point of tears.

      Eh, I was raised on Victor Borge. I went to see him when I was nine. I still find the concept of "fivehead" to be hilarious. <br/>

On the other hand, I did take it somewhat personally, and overreacted. But come on man, saying Borge sucks is like shouting out your car window that the Ninja Turtles were off rimming each other when they weren't beating the shit out of mutated rates. I will be made  <em>visibly upset</em>  by such a claim.

      Well, as an atheist who doesn't particularly like his family and never really had much interaction with his extended family Mythmas has always been about the presents. Still, when the displays start going up before Halloween that's a problem. <br/>

No Christmas displays or discussions at any time before the beginning of December. We need to restrict holidays entirely to the month in which they occur.

noun <br/> 
 <strong>the constant low-level activity of a body tissue,</strong>  esp. muscle tone. <br/>

      Funny story that I can't verify in the slightest: <br/> 
 <br/> 
My sister's friend was at the airport a few years ago, waiting for something or some shit - anyway, she was reading a crappy magazine and generally trying to stay awake, and decided to do some people watching to keep herself amused, when who should come along but one Art Garfunkel.  Either nobody else was around, or nobody else recognised him - but I doubt anyone was going to mob him anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He went up to the food stall to get a drink, and then stood and looked around for a second while he waited for the attendant to arrive so as he could get a drink.  Then, when there clearly wasn't anyone around that he could see, he goes behind the counter and grabs a drink and walks away  <strong><em>holy shit I just saw Art Garfunkel steal something</em></strong> <br/> <br/> <br/> ....then he comes back a minute later with the attendant and pays for it, as he clearly only left to find her. <br/> <br/> <br/> True story.

      my old lady geezer alter ego takes offense to the sentiments expressed by Mr. Cornelius Bear. that little strumpet probably thinks Sibelius is the name of the new Cadillac model with a hybrid engine and an interior woodgrain trim. my old cunny is seasoned! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cornelius disappoints me, truly. rather than regaining his youth through such exploits, it has made him seem all the more elderly, and dare i say, even a mite  <em>desperate</em> . (here come the lames.) what i appreciated so much about Cornelius in the past was his effortless class which shone through despite his aloof modesty. here he assumes an air of defensiveness and arrogance, but i suppose traipsing around with a woman young enough to be your granddaughter will do that to a man.

      Well, it's kinda radical, and not guaranteed. You'd want to save your bookmarks and pw's and all that crap somewhere, then proceed to not only uninstall FF, but then manually delete Mozilla\firefox from Application Data in Docs & Settings.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It would be nice to know more about the way it's built so maybe one file could be replaced instead of the whole schmeer. <br/> 
 This is assuming that the latest java is installed and is not the original issue here.

      I chubbied you, my Deadala, for a few reasons.  One is that you picked up on that wonderful old word  <em>cunny</em> , which should have more currency to brighten our era of degraded txtng and OMG English.  Twom that you have so enthusiastically embraced your inner ladygeezer, so full of seasoning!  Third, because you challenge Cornelius, whether your challenge be found justified or not.  Dating someone young enough to be a grandchild of mine would land me in jail for statutory rape or child abuse; I have a few years to go before that demographic is legally within my purview.  I do know I have caught myself with perhaps  <em>a little bit too much eagerness</em>  when I get to meet my little college boy, and that eagerness has a whiff of the desperate about it.  Maybe this is true for Mr. Bear as well.  As our friend Stereo likes to say, "There comes a time."

      The two are not mutually exclusive. The two English professors at my school that I admired and respected most both ended up doing a Cornelius kind of thing. The charming Scottish professor of Gothic and Victorian literature ended up not getting his contract renewed amid a flurry of rumors and accusations of midnight trysts with sorority girls in his department office. And the nerdy Restoration expert suddenly divorced his wife and took a year's leave of absence; when I knocked on his door to get my recommendation letter, I was greeted by the hot art major girl whom I had been too afraid to talk to in class. The thing that makes this even more messed up is that the department only had like eight people. This was the beginning of my disillusionment with the idea of noble intellectual asceticism.

I never understood why everyone hated  <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em>  so much. I'm not saying I thought it was great or anything, but there are clearly things out there which are so much worse but end up being spared the sort of intense ridicule which that movie has been the constant target of. It's gotten to the point at which a person is considered to be terrible for not hating it appropriately and that level of cultural disdain always bothers me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anybody care to explain this? I'm really curious.

      Because when something suddenly becomes hugely popular (and Napoleon Dynamite did become VERY popular, often amongst types of people who "aren't supposed to be able to GET this, you know?", like frat boys), there is an inevitable backlash which is usually disproportionate to the thing in question's quality (or lack thereof). <br/>

      I understand what you're saying, tekende. It's basically exactly how I felt when I finally got to go see Radiohead a couple of years ago.  <em>All</em>  jocks.  <em>All</em>  frat boys. What do douche bags like these get from a song like "No Surprises?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, yeah. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But on the other hand, I didn't stop liking Radiohead just because of what their fan base had apparently become. I guess that's where I differ.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I saw  <em>N.D.</em>  for the first time a year or so after it was released and I was mostly unaware of it's popularity when I finally did see it (and completely unaware of it's popularity among frat boys, or whomever). I guess I just watched it as I would watch any movie and I thought it was alright. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Again, let me say that I'm not, like,  <em>fighting</em>  for this movie. I just thought it was OK and it always blew my mind to hear people talking about it as if it were...I dunno... <em>Crossroads,</em>  or something. That's all.

As for Napoleon Dynamite I had the option to see it at a pre-release screening and, for whatever reason, I failed to follow up on this. The ensuing popularity really made me reconsider wanting to see it in the first place. I think it was a year or so later by the time I actually managed to watch it.

I got to the part at the beginning of the movie. The one with the two kids, the bike, and the ramp. You remember that part, right? <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL, BY THE WAY.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was groovin' on the movie, even though it wasn't really my thing, when I realized, suddenly, out of the blue... <br/>

That this was my life. If I had stayed in North Carolina. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And this would've been my children's life, if I had stayed there. <br/>

      He is, ultimately, principled in that he has principles and he refuses to compromise them. <br/>

He is, however, willing to use the coin toss to accept that there is, perhaps, a fate to all people. He may be wrong, but the coin will tell the truth. The coin will be the instrument by which fate makes itself known. <br/>

      Bah, that is totally not his style. Nice Pete is a fan of  <em>Blood of the Beasts</em>  a 1949 documentary short of actual animal slaughter in Parisian slaughterhouses. You can view it on YouTube  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101835/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFAUA8_mfXs">here</a>  in three parts. The director later went on to make  <em>Eyes Without A Face</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is, quite honestly, the most horrible thing I have ever seen. One second it is a horse being led around by people whom it trusts, the next second it is lying on the ground and it is meat and it is treated as meat with no regard for it being alive just a moment before. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not a vegetarian, but watching this really made me want to be.

      Zapatos, hijo lindo, what I pine for and want is without question big.  It can be soft, but  <em>must </em> have the option of a change of state.  And if 'Nutter Butter' is what I hope it is in this context, why I just eat that stuff up.

      I have been told that one of the best things you can say to a German is that you do not regard him or his countrymen as a threat or harbor any ill will against them. <br/>

They really do seem to be very devoted to trying to show how they are totally different now. They were going through some bad times then, they'd lost their job and kinda got into a bad place, but that is so totally over now. If anything I think they're overcompensating far too much.

      I'm pretty sure the Middle example is from Canterbury Tales. Partially because that's the most common example everyone uses for middle English, but also because I seem to remember that this is from the very beginning, and he's about to say that this is the time when people go on their pilgrimage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The most common example people use for Old English is Beowulf, but that's not where this one is from, since it talks about a king and some archbishops and England... and the use of alliterative verse makes me think it's from Gawain and the Green Knight.

      I remember Gawain and the Green Knight.  For some reason I was the only person in the entire class (including the teacher) who noticed that  <em>every single line</em>  has alliteration.   <br/> 
I did just use examples from the Wikipedia page.  And I did basically use the basic go-to examples (Beowulf and Canterbury Tales).  Beowulf is the only Old English piece of literature people can name, and I always, always see the beginning of Canterbury Tales used for the example of Middle English.   <br/> 
If anyone from my senior english class was not able to get these examples instantly, then I would classify them as being an unintelligent person.

      I didn't read Beowulf either. I did, however, read the Aeneid, but in Latin so that doesn't really count. Canterbury Tales had a few segments involved in AP English II (Senior Year). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also read The Divine Comedy in 9th grade, but by choice and there was definitely an element of wanting to show off involved. It was certainly nice that when I was required to read a bit of it for my Medieval and Renaissance Humanities course in college I didn't have to really worry about it. Because nothing is more important than knowing which Medieval popes and Florentine nobles Dante had a beef with.

      Haven't read it. How does this BBC adaptation sound?: <br/> 
 <em>The Miller's Tale, adapted by Peter Bowker<br/>
<br/>
John (Dennis Waterman) runs a pub in suburban Kent. He hosts a regular Karaoke night, where his much younger wife Alison (Billie Piper) is queen bee. One night a smooth talking stranger, Nick (James Nesbitt), arrives claiming to be a talent scout and declaring that Alison has what it takes to be a star. Alison is drawn to him by the promise of fame, but his motives aren't quite what they seem.</em>

      It has tales of a variety of types. It's really more of an anthology than anything so you can't necessarily claim that it's entirely boring. Some stories are certainly boring, but there are also ones filled with bawdy humour.

I'm pretty sure that it all depends. <br/> 
"The team put on their uniforms" is correct. <br/> 
"The team won its first game" is also correct. <br/> 
If you are talking about the team as a collection of individuals, it is plural in meaning.  If it is viewed as one entity, it is singular. <br/>

      The difference in those two sentences is because of the object, not the subject. You can't say "the team put on its uniform" because a team has more than one uniform, and saying "the team put on its uniforms" sounds wrong because once you acknowledge that there are multiple uniforms it's weird to think of them being put onto one entity. So by necessity, team becomes plural in that case. And if you really wanted to be a dick about it, I think you could possibly argue that this usage is still incorrect and you would have to say "team members".

Excuse the Wikipedia <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Formal and notional agreement<br/>
<br/>
In BrE, collective nouns can take either singular (formal agreement) or plural (notional agreement) verb forms, according to whether the emphasis is, respectively, on the body as a whole or on the individual members; compare a committee was appointed... with the committee were unable to agree....[5][6] Compare also the following lines of Elvis Costello's song "Oliver's Army": Oliver's Army are on their way / Oliver's Army is here to stay. Some of these nouns, for example staff,[7] actually combine with plural verbs most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
In AmE, collective nouns are usually singular in construction: the committee was unable to agree... AmE however may use plural pronouns in agreement with collective nouns: the team takes their seats, rather than the team takes its seats. The rule of thumb is that a group acting as a unit is considered singular and a group of "individuals acting separately" is considered plural.[8] However, such a sentence would most likely be recast as the team members take their seats. Despite exceptions such as usage in the New York Times, the names of sports teams are usually treated as plurals even if the form of the name is singular.[9]<br/>
<br/>
The difference occurs for all nouns of multitude, both general terms such as team and company and proper nouns (for example, where a place name is used to refer to a sports team). For instance,<br/>
<br/>
BrE: The Clash are a well-known band; AmE: The Clash is a well-known band.<br/>
BrE: New York are the champions; AmE: New York is the champion.<br/>
<br/>
Proper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in both AmE and BrE; for example, The Beatles are a well-known band; The Giants are the champions.</em></div>

      Chuck nibbled his fingernails midway through the 4th period of the Knicks game. He jittered with nervousness over the [waiting for the beautiful iota of time as the last breath leaves the soon-to-be corpse]132. This [murder]133 was of extreme importance to Chuck and his Knicks. His team scored again. Could they actually win? Chuck pondered this when suddenly he imagined inexplicably the face of [a pizza cutter sharpened well enough to slice through bone]134. After this fleeting thought, Chuck looked up to the Jumbotron for the score. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Suddenly, the lighting in the stadium flashed off, then on again. On the Jumbotron was not the numbers Chuck expected. On it was the face of Leopold, the ex-husband of Mary. Leopold stared outward blankly, with no expression outside of his eyes. Then, slowly, he began to smile. The corners of Leopold's mouth drew closer and closer to his ears as he smiled. The crowd around Chuck was [the expression of the man who found the finger in the chili]135. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just then, Leopold stepped to the left, and Mary was on the screen. She was tied down by leather and hooks and blindfolded. Leopold laughed off screen. Mary was on her knees with her hands tied to her front, like in prayer. Leopold returned to the screen holding an axe from a nearby fire station. He laughed again. Chuck cried. Leopold swung the axe like a golf club, a good and full windup most brilliantly executed. His weapon struck the woman just below the chin. Upon contact, the screen flashed back to the basketball game. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chuck cried and hoped he had imagined it, but his fellow audience's screaming shredded that notion. <br/> <br/> <br/> 132 score <br/>

      Man ladies and gentlemen your old boy falseprophet is feelin a little like an SAT prep book whose owner has gone to college and left me to let my pages yellow. A lady I met through a friend decided to come to a party with me and we were basically talking to each other all night about matters of life and sharing cherished memories but when it came time for the night to end I leaned in and  <em>she gave me the cheek</em>  and I am in a state of a tired frustrated boredom I am used to because it is not that I wish we had gone all the way because if my life were perfect it wouldn't have to be that way on a first date in the Go-Go Nineties, no I just wish she hadn't turned the wrong direction then looked at me and said "Thanks!" because that is a hella strange reaction to have to a dude who has just tried to make out with you and this is usually a signal that no further dates are necessary, the amount of fun that is possible to have has been had and I am off to look somewhere anew and it would be nice if I could say my  <em>Achewood</em>  is like a comforting webcomic pillow but seeing Cornelius's love just fills me with a quiet rage that I am too familiar with to get all up on the fast-track about so I will just leave you with the knowledge that no matter how realistic, no matter how literary, no matter how convincing, no matter how moving, we must all keep in mind that all fiction is a simplification, all moments of action and thought that make the world happen cannot be distilled in even the most verbose-yet-concise of pages.

      Maybe it's because you let it slip that you make snuff porn. Happens to me all the time. You're talking to a lady at a party all night, you lean in, she gives you the damn cheek and you're all "did I mention I make snuff porn?" and she's all, "yeah, a couple of hours ago", and you're like "shit, I really thought I'd got through that one". <br/>

      It is the sad, old, Charles Foster Kane, clapping loudly, roundly, and in an unhinged way for the woman who he put up on a pedestal as his own  <em>Venus de Milo</em> , roundly ignoring that his Venus was not only missing her arms, but any speck of talent for the stage.

      Citizen Kane is due to be remade in 2011. Perhaps you can lobby for Simon Pegg to play Kane in it. We'll probably get Matthew McConaughey though.

      at "i leaned in" i was all "dang falseprophet, you go player!" cuz most dudes i know don't even get to that stage, they just mainly imagine with all their might how it would feel to hold hands with the lady, eat her cooked meals, and somewhere in there is the thought of coming on her face, not because she is an object, but because she is your gf and she is down. but they don't do shit, and then they go home and dismiss it as something that could never have worked out anyway. but you acted, and that's hell of commendable. like my mother always used to say, "if you don't apply to Harvard, you'll never know if you could've gotten in". i applied. i didn't get in. but that's beside the point.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i'm pretty sure that if i weren't a lady i would never have had a relationship my entire life. i don't understand men, and i understand fellow ladies even less. in fact, it boggles my mind how people ever manage to connect in the real world. physical attraction is cheap, you can get that anywhere. but like, i've never met a dude in real life who i've felt both an intellectual AND emotional connection with. whether this is an issue with the dude or with the medium, i don't know, but i'm sure the medium doesn't help. like it's really hard to know if a dude is sincere irl.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
there was one time where i felt like i really connected with a dude i met at a party we were throwing at my apt, and on subsequent hang-outs, we talked about a lot of deep shit and he kept telling me i was the coolest girl he'd ever met at our school and the other chicks here just don't "get it". considering the content of our conversations, i was pretty convinced that this was actually true. he lent me his copy of j.g. ballard's "crash" and i lent him my copy of nelly arcan's "whore" and i really thought it was going to be a Thing. after a couple of makeouts, i suppose he became frustrated that i wasn't "putting out" so he decided to never call me again or answer any of my calls. and i am left angry and wondering if everything he said to me earlier was pure bullshit, or whether it was true, but still totally secondary to getting off. to this day i can't decide which would have been more insulting. the point is, this is why girls are suspicious of and guard against your advances irl, even if there seems to be hell of "cherished moments". it's like how imperfect information leads to market failure. we just can't see inside your heads. but you know where you can see inside people's heads?  <em>on the internet.</em>  and i will just leave it at that. ALL SMART PEOPLE SHOULD INTERNET DATE. ok i'm finished.

      Daedala, I am sorry that you have to deal with assholes.  We are all over the place and we just want to get laid... Most of the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am that guy who goes out and gets ladies, then goes home with those ladies, and has sex with those ladies.  Then I don't call them back. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However!  I try to let them know before hand.  Something along the lines of, "I am a big giant slut, and I am not down for a relationship right now."  If a man says something along those lines, he is probably not lieing.  If a man tells you are so super great and all these things, he probably isn't lieing to you, because honestly you are so super great Dae. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are smart, you talk about tentacle rape, you love the Achewoods, and you are rockin' hot.  These are things I look for in a lady, the other thing I look for is me.  In her.  Doing the sex. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Uh...  Yeah!  Party!

      Damn girl, this is not a happy story at all.  <br/> 
Yet for exactly the exact same reasons, all smart people should not internet date, methinks. If only so that they don't leave dating irl to the  <em>others</em> . That would be a mess.

      I applied to, among others, Cornell. My guidance counselor failed to send in necessary materials from my record despite being provided with an addressed, stamped manila envelope. I was notified of this when they sent me a letter after the application deadline saying that my application was incomplete. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only application he sent in was to a state school. I try not to blame him exclusively, but he basically fucked me over more or less completely. I'd even flown out and scheduled unnecessary application interviews.

      Thanks for the kind smart words daedala. Sounds like the guy you are talking about is exactly the kind of dude I am afraid I might become if I decide to stop being rizzeal and start trying to get lizzaid and then I would hate myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for your later comment about black dudes being too smooth and confident, come on man look at our boy Barry O. and look where it got him. There is a difference between being smooth and confident and having nothing to back it up and having plenty to back it up. I'm workin on it. But it's hard to be 23 and have plenty to back it up with, which is why the hot art major types sleep with the professors. So it goes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And also, on retrospect, she may have just been thinking "Oh shit oh shit man this guy is fun but I am just a young intern in Washington DC and I have no idea whether I will even be able to keep living in this city in a month and a half so now is not a good time to start a relationship oh shit oh shit." And even if that is the case that is pretty much the only way to think about it that will keep me from gettin all depressed, even if it is a self-delusion. So I'll just keep on keepin on.

      I am not being sarcastic when I say that if thinking this makes you feel better, by all means keep thinking it if you are able to. But we know that most of the time this is NOT the case, because it could not be farther from the current cultural paradigm, in which girls have interpreted the gains of feminism to mean that letting dudes bone them without expecting any kind of commitment, intellectual connection, or even phone call from said dudes is 'empowering', and these are not just trashy sorority bimbos, but also the 'nice' girls of the sort that guys like us would like to be with, so while we sit here wondering if maybe we came on too strong or she just wasn't ready for a relationship, millions of girls, possibly some of the same ones, are out getting boned by dudes who couldn't care less, and it's not that we want to be like those assholes when in fact we would be perfectly happy with a world in which people go out with each other for like a month or at least a fucking  <em>week</em>  (you know, long enough to actually connect as human beings) and  <em>then</em>  have sex, but at the same time we see that the world is NOT like that, and when we are constantly made to believe that your worth as a guy depends on how successful you are at tricking girls into doing you or how much money you are able to earn for the purpose of gaining leverage over women, and when our best hope is being told not to worry, our time will come if we just wait our turn until eventually some of these nice girls settle down with us once they are all worn out from their years of wild, consequence-free sex with guys like zapatos (nothing personal, just using the closest example at hand), who will, for their part, probably find someone as well when they decide they feel like it and thus have had the best of both worlds, and that even if you finally find the perfect girl it may never fully make up for the deprivation you've felt until then... well, then you just can't help but feel a little  <em>screwed</em> , and not in the good way.

      Wow I never even made that connection. It's a very tenuous one, though. The Underground Man is hyper-conscious, while Trevor struck me as barely self-aware. Yes, both of them try to rescue a prostitute, but for entirely different reasons and with entirely different results.

      Paul Schrader apparently said that Notes From Underground was an influence on Taxi Driver.  But it was actually cited on Wikipedia.   <br/> 
I don't know if Travis is hypoconscious.  Why can't he be hyper-conscious?  We do not see what is going on in his mind.  Perhaps he knows that he is destroying himself and decided it.  I do get the sense that Travis is grasping meaning from revenge (assassinating the senator because he is somehow to blame for the failed date, and then killing the mafioso).  Underground Dude gets it from trying to assert revenge on the officer who makes him step aside, and the guys at the party.  It's all about how the universe is inherently meaningless, and you have to pick your own meaning. <br/> 
This sounds like a response for Senior English.  I don't know what I'm talking about. <br/> 
Either way they are both kinda existential, in tone.

      from what i recall of the movie, Travis is like a small child who is unable to understand or accept the nature/meaninglessness of the world in which he lives. the underground man, on the other hand, accepts fully the meaninglessness of his life, and it is for this reason he constructs such mind games for himself and others, in order to infuse his life with any meaning at all. Taxi Driver displays a bleaker tone than existentialism (nihilism? idk). there is a refusal to deeply analyze the meaninglessnss of his life, because such an analysis would itself be meaning. the movie seems to say that we are not responsible for the meaninglessness of our lives and therefore if meaninglessness is inevitable, why do anything, why follow any rules. but this leads to a complete disintegration of the psyche because the mind itself is composed of rules that determine what is meaningful and what is not in terms of language, concepts, and thought. this disintegration is what i interpreted as happening to Travis at the end, anyway. but i could be wrong.. i had some alcohol and was pretty sleepy.

      i probably do live in a bubble, but if i never said anything, i'd never learn from people calling me out on it, would i? the reason i understood the movie the way i did is because i honestly could not understand why Travis would want to assassinate Senator Palantine. to me, this is either because he is childish, or because he is mentally unstable. i thought the only social commentary of the movie was that being a Vietnam veteran can really fuck people up psychologically because it reveals to them the failure of politics, and forces upon them the subsequent realization that the purpose of their lives up to now has been for a meaningless cause, and now they have to deal with the meaninglessness of their post-war existence, thus resulting in a dissolution of the psyche, etc. if there is deeper meaning behind it, please tell me, i'd really like to know.

      Everyone lives in a bubble until they break out of it, but have you heard of or know anyone who has? <br/> 
  Talking and thinking  never make it happen. Nor does taking drugs. Sometimes you can get a glimpse outside that bubble of your life. It is Reality out there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 I never sat through this entire movie, but I have the gist of the story. And it's just a movie. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Your take on the Viet-vet angle is incomplete. Forget about mental instability or dissolution of psyche. That happens in bootcamp, or the guy will fail his mission. He's been brainwashed into an amoral killer, then cut loose to fend in the Big City.  <br/> 
 A guy who has been trained to kill people sees in ultimatums.  Being a soldier who has killed in combat is mortgaging your soul. He is outside the parameters of 'normal'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In return for that, this guy lives in black & white, life & death world, so he sees mundane existence much more clearly than regular folks for the crap it is.  <br/> 
Crystal clarity, all that neurotic bullshit is long gone because war will not tolerate it....until it comes creeping back when he's home again in the 'World'. <br/>

 He sees how meaningless everyone's existence is, but especially his own. He has done evil for a cause he believed in, and it has  isolated him, left him damaged. He wants to believe in something, wants to redeem himself, but he doesn't have the strength for the long haul. <br/> 
 It was just a movie.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 The hard thing for the Vietnam Vets I knew (and know) was to return and dial down their perception to that humdrum after the ultimate rush of Kill or Be Killed. The astonishing thing to me was the (few) guys who somewhat self-healed after coming back. I'm thinking of one friend who went back a few years ago, to try to get some personal healing by helping people there, spreading some cash around, medical relief, etc. He really needed this to live with himself.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some did that physically but in their heads they never left Vietnam. It was by far the biggest rush they'd ever experienced, and they were fixated, helplessly hooked on it. <br/> 
Does that make sense? <br/>

      Nadir, you are being a TOTAL douche. Sje was speculating about the possible influence of Notes from Underground on Taxi Driver. You came totally out of left field to say that he doesn't know what he's talking about, then went on a rant about how your personal Vietnam experiences made you an expert on the movie. Nowhere in your subsequent replies have you even mentioned Notes from Underground, which leads me to believe that you have never read it, which means that in the context of the discussion that you needlessly butted into, it is in fact YOU who does not know what he is talking about. <br/>

      Actually, achilles, I may have been out of line, but you're out of line also. <br/> 
  Okay, before I go any further, let me proffer an apology in advance of what I'm going to say, to sje here for stomping on his sensibilities. That was rude. Big hugs for the kid too.  <br/> 
And to you and aperson. If you guys get my point somewhere down the line, the apology was not needed. But, if by pissing you off, I got you thinking about things, maybe you'll agree it was worth it. (I think Daedala gets it). <br/> 
 <br/> 
My rant was mainly an answer for Daedala's question. Maybe I'm being a douche, or maybe you and sje aren't getting the point I was making. <br/> 
 I did  <strong>not</strong>  say I was an expert on the movie, I said I hadn't seen it. I don't really intend to. But I do not see that plotline as being existentialist. This guy is not existentialist. What was that existentialist story by Sartre, the guy in prison- in Algiers- on the his last day of life? That's existentialism.  <br/> 
 This guy becomes so focused in the reality that he's dying today, that he breaks through that bubble we were talking about. Everything shuts down, and he wakes up. His death is first the catalyst for this, then becomes inconsequential, as opposed to, say the death of David F. Wallace, which was an utter tragedy. Sartre's guy's death becomes inconsequential to him because he has transcended the life/death experience. This is a true thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 In my view and experience, existentialism is the Western version of zen. Being here right now. Not tomorrow. Not dancing around concepts. Not having beliefs, opinions, views even.  <br/> 
 There are a few things in life that get us focussed to that place. Our own Death can be one of those events, if we use it for that. The very best time in life to get an experience like this is when one is young- your age. This happened to me, seemingly by accident at the time. And no, not in the war, I wasn't in the war. Just my friends.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Yes, I was picking on sje. He says he's atheist. That's a start, because in my experience, belief of any sort gets in the way of experience. Existentialism is pure inner experientialism. And the thing that happens is all the mental racket dies away. The way to cultivate having a shot at that is to discipline oneself to still that racket, to develop ultimate focus and one-pointedness. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, in reality, to get a whiff of the existential experience, one must shut up. You attention has to totally cave in like a black hole. If one is focussed, one may get it, and I can tell you this much- it is freedom. The real deal. No drug experience can come close; although I cannot say I tried every one of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Rude of me? yes, absolutely.  Again, I apologize, poor sje. A zen slap, and  you responded like a normal human being. WTF, guy?  <br/> 
  I thought I'd give you some time, clown around some with you, get you to laugh and see the inconsequentiality of it, maybe the zen would work through. <br/> 
Which is fine. Whatever. <br/> 
You're all amazingly bright young folks, and I enjoy your banter and wit tremendously. Many of you are way, way ahead of me in that respect, and I find it heartening. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I see some of you saying you're depressed,  that saddens me. You're depressed by things you can't control and aren't responsible for, yet feel deeply about. <br/> 
 Things should not be that way, you should not have these clouds in your world,  yet you are inheriting a world from my generation, a world that has alot of shitty, scary stuff. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 If you could step out of what you think you are and experience the now, all that sadness goes away, never to return. Sometimes a well-timed slap can do that for a person. Sometimes, not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Okay? <br/> <br/> <br/>

I know. But give it some room in your head. Play with it as a concept first. Try this, when you  <br/> 
have some time and a quiet place- <br/> 
 Visualize Time as an infinite line of energy, for that is what it is. And your existence is exactly  <br/> 
dead-center on it, a pearl on a string between the infinite Past and the infinite Future. The  <br/> 
Now. This is where you have actually existed your entire life, but no one ever told you. But, thinking about it now, you realize you've always known it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 It may be scary at first for you are truly alone in the Universe. <br/> 
 And like, oh maybe it was Belgand who <br/> 
was saying a few threads ago- nothing matters- disappear, let go of everything, and only your own awareness is all that remains. <br/> 
That's existential. It is freedom.

      that makes a shit-ton of sense. it really helps to imagine the affliction in positive rather than negative terms. like it's not some terrible experience they wish to escape (though it might be that too), but some terrible experience that made such a deep and irrevocable impression that perhaps they want to recapture. in this light, Taxi Driver makes a lot more sense.  <br/>

I can't believe in a world, created such as this one is, that does not have ultimate meaning somewhere. <br/>

      Both, actually. One does not preclude the other, and in fact, the two are supposed to, at the best of times, compliment one another. The fact that there exists in too many people's minds a separation between one and the other is always something I've never understood...how can such unbelievable order arise out of nothing, without any kind of external Force acting upon it? How can you live in a world of miracles firing like the pistons of an engine, and not feel drawn towards Something? But too often the most vocal are those at the far poles of either spectrum, driving wedges of ignorance and condemnation into a symbiotic relationship that, for thousands of years, supported one another beautifully. <br/>

      Honestly, on one level you're right - That it exists, is enough. Also,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101835/https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Universe">others</a>  seem to agree with you. However, how can we think about where we're going if we don't look at where we've been? I don't believe that Science holds all the answers, or, more accurately, that Science can ever get to the end of the coil that it's trying to unravel, but we can learn quite a bit from it. And given the experiences in the past few centuries of great scientific ideas affecting society as a whole (as mishandled as they were), perhaps a greater depth and bredth of appreciation for the world around us would assist the world's cultures into a little bit better place.

      Here we have a bit of a quandary. Namely, as C.S. Lewis pointed out (Have I mentioned that he's dreamy...?) if you're convinced there's no such thing as a miracle, then there's no way you're going to believe a miracle occurred. This goes for any supernatural phenomenon - although it seems to me that nowadays people are much more willing to see the paranormal than the divine in a situation. I have a simple definition for a miracle - something that Should Not Have Happened, but is also Good. I mean, demon posession is definately not normal, but I would hesitate to call in miraculous. Further, for your sake, I'll stick to "external" miracles, rather than the several that I've seen (and been involved in) that have no visible component...but left lives completely changed. Now, all that being said, miracles that I've been involved with, that I know off the top of my head... <br/>

- A young woman who had her gall bladder taken out had severe dietary restrictions. Bad Things happened when she strayed from them. She said that she felt healed while at a revival, and since then has been able to eat whatever she wanted. Last couple of times we had dinner together we made boiled dinner and split-pea soup. Very greasy. Very tasty. <br/> 
 <br/> 
- A man I know went to the doctor and found out he had a tumor under his shoulder "about the size of a shoebox". He eventually made a full recovery. Shortly after his surgery, he was driving past a field by his house, and saw a moose standing in the middle of it. So being the guy that he is, took his rifle and popped the moose. The gun he used he affectionately calls the "lazy man's hunting rifle". It was not a good thing to have braced against your shoulder right after major surgery in the general vicinity, but he didn't hurt himself. He'd been hunting that field for over ten years. It was the first time he saw a moose there, or even signs of a moose. Of course, he went back, many times, but never saw any signs of any more moose. So everybody thinks that the moose was just a little bit of icing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
- A friend of mine was arrested, and then afterwards became extremely involved in our church. His story inspired and helped many people, first in our church, then in a school for at-risk students where his particular story resonated with many of them. That started him to running a bible study and hang-out time for these kids so they have something to do that was positive and kept them on the right track. Meanwhile, he was still fighting his court battles, and it was going very poorly. A lawyer backing out mid-trial, misinformation and confusion causing him to look worse in the eyes of the court than he was, and setback after setback financially made it look like there was no hope for him. The very minimum sentence that he expected to get was eight years. He was found guilty of all counts. On the day of his sentencing, we were all praying for the best, but expecting the worst. He asked his friends and family to come to court with him, some to say a few words to sway the judge towards leniency, most to offer comfort and support. I could write for pages about the courtroom that day...in fact, I may yet...but at the end of it, I don't think there was anybody who wasn't affected. You could feel the Presence in the air. It was a beautiful, miraculous day...topped by a mere 90 day sentence instead of over a decade behind bars. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know that looking at them with a cynical slant, these are all things that perhaps could be explained without bringing the divine into it. But after you've seen things that you can't unsee, you begin to get the "taste" for something more working around you. You do have to keep your eyes and your heart open for it, though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the end of the day, I'm not looking to convince you. All I can do is tell you my story, and the stories of the wonderful people God has put into my life. After that...well, if you knock, the door'll be opened. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(One of these days I'll write something short and to the point!)

 <br/> 
Thank you for assuming it is wild. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The funny thing is, I hate it.  I mean well maybe I don't because I keep doing it, but, it bothers me that I get sex so easily.  I remember in high school it would be years between partners, but now... its like weeks if not days.  I don't even try! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I actually do not try at all.  I'm there just doing my own thing, leaving them alone, and then BAM I'm on my back and her head is in my crotch.  Its fun at first, but the novelty fades. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The reason I bitch is because I cannot find a relationship.  Yeah yeah, stop using women and you'll find someone blah blah blah.  No.  They use me, because they need to get laid and I put out.  There are girls I like and I do not sleep with them, then they stop talking to me.  So then there is a girl a like, I get the chance to sleep with her and do... then she stops talking to me.  So I meet a girl I don't like, fuck her, and she keeps trying to talk to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO ABOUT MY PROBLEMS.

      I understand. I've been on both sides to varying degrees at different times. But I do not currently share your predicament. I live with my girlfriend, so I'm not really on either side of this situation. I'm in a good relationship in which the sex ebbs and flows. But I remember knowing guys like you when I was in the kind of place in which sje or achilles are in, and, if they're like I was, they won't want to hear about that sort of problem you're having.  <br/>

      Not an expert on this subject by any means, but if you guys don't mind I'll share my experience: <br/> 
 <br/> 
First, for all you cynical bastards out there, a disclaimer:  I'm not 5'4 and 300 pounds, I don't have any physical deformity above or below the waistline, etc.  So fuck you very much for thinking looks play into it.  On with my tale: <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I was 24 (as elbow and tekende state they are) I felt the same way.  I had no desire to manipulate women or situations to get laid under false pretenses.  I boiled it down like this...my life, and my mind, were fucked up enough without adding the drama and layers of lies. I would not have been able to keep track anyway.  I liked books and computers, neither of which was likely to introduce me to any new women.  Online scenes were a barren wasteland of lies and hopes never fulfilled.  I played soccer twice a week and met a few girls there, but that never went anywhere.  So, when the .com boom went pop I was losing my job and sitting at home on my own depressed.  Something had to change.  Thought processes are different for everyone, but I just finally said fuck it, I'm doing what I want to do, no matter what the cultural conventions of common sense.  I ended up selling everything I owned (not much) taking massive loans and going to grad school in Europe.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It shook up everything in my life, including exposing me to all kinds of different women...smart sexy women who knew what they wanted.  Frankly, changing my life and doing the the things that made me happy made me more interesting and attractive person to spend time with, and my social life reflected that.  I stopped being so cynical about other people for a little while and took social risks.  Sure I was embarrassed from time to time, but my real friends didn't care so it didn't cost me anything.  Money is just the biggest red herring.  The girls who look at money first...fuck 'em.  They aren't worth wasting time on.  However, I found that, like there are many guys who just pretend to be macho for the guys, there are many girls who just pretend to be about money for their girlfriends. <br/> 
Long story short, I took a risk and it paid off.  It might work for you.  You'd be amazed how change can seep into every aspect of your life.

      i just realized, just like there's macho men and regular men, there's macho geeks and regular geeks. like macho geeks are all "do research? care? that's GAY. i'll do research and care about (some totally obscure video game reference). being sensitive to chicks is for newbs."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
but the lady, realizing the geek is a geek, wants to make him feel confident and virile, so she pretends it's really good, and the geek is like "awesome, that totally worked, one less thing for me to worry about" and the lady resents this for a while and finally brings it up, and the geek gets angry and is all "well now i don't even wanna try cuz we already know you basically think i got no skills" so now he refuses to care or do research out of anger and embarrassment. it is basically a lose lose situation for the lady.

      Depends. Many times the geek's natural lack of self-confidence causes him to constantly worry that the lady is not enjoying herself and is always working to try and be better and better. The lady does not pretend, but the geek still worries that her response is perhaps not as strong as it ought to be. Is she really enjoying it enough? <br/>

If she ever were to express such effusive praise he would doubt the veracity of such statements and find it even more likely that she is just lying about his terrible sexing just to make him feel better. He is OK with being told that he sucks, but has trouble accepting that it might really be good. Either way he keeps trying to improve himself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The anger and embarrassment seems entirely unexpected and odd to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are totally macho geeks and they are scary and weird. They are basically half frat boy but obsessed with something other than sports, drinking, and sex with cheap skanks.

Belgand I that guy, the one who doesn't believe the moans and the panting.  Probably because I've had a few fakers and it is just stuck in my head.  Were I with a lady and she gave me some constructive criticism afterwards... I would totally be happy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I feel that maybe the ladies need to realize we're on a team, trying to defeat the elusive matched orgasm.  Its like I am a tank and she is a healer, but we need a DD. Come on baby, look for those green question marks. <br/>

      Wow, you get actual moans and panting? Must be nice. I have never been with anyone who was particularly vocal. I mean, yeah, I can tell she's enjoying herself, but in a quiet sort of way. Not frigid. Well, she's  <em>is</em> frigid most of the time, but at least not during sex. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Most sex ends with a post-sex discussion of things that maybe could have gone better, areas for improvement, things that were really great. All the sorts of things that weren't a big deal at the time and mentioning them in any greater detail would have just ruined the mood. She gets tired, but I do not. She is also the one who never wants to go again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I swear sometimes I really feel like the woman in this relationship. Not just because I enjoy shopping, care greatly about my hair, and stay home while she works either.

      She is not entirely happy about that last bit though. A shame too as I think I'd very much enjoy being a housewife. As long as I wasn't socially oppressed in that status and didn't have to take care of children (children are terrible). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't understand how some women make it out to be a big deal. Staying at home totally isn't. Then again, it depends heavily on your standards for cleaning. Then I could maybe see it taking a day or two of work every week. Otherwise, not so much.

      The one with money is worse, because he is not going to recover from his addiction.  The poor one will not be having fun and will maybe get some help eventually, where the rich guy will just keep doing coke until he gets shot by the poor guy who needs to get high.

      Unlike drugs or alcohol sex is at least moderately aerobic exercise and as long as you're practicing safe sex with undiseased people it's not hurting your body. I doubt it will also manage to consume that much money provided you're getting sex regularly and not having to pay for it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seems pretty good to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Having all the coke you want sounds like a quick way to end up with a really crippling habit and a possible overdose.

      It isn't so much the word itself, as it's use and inference.  Calling someone a fag (in the context of "furfag" or "don't be such a fag") suggests that being a fag is something intrinsically bad, something that you should consider an insult as a non-homosexual. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nothing is black and white, of course, and humor changes things around, but it is considered homophobic if used in a disparaging way, yeah.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In short, stop being such a tekende, sheesh!

      My take on it is this: you know how marginalized groups "reclaim" derogatory words to give them a positive connotation of pride or whatever? This is sort of a similar process, only instead of changing the connotation of the word, people change its referent. So while gay people are using 'fag' to still refer to 'gay', but in a totally awesome way, straight people are using it to still connote 'gross deviant' but to refer to furries instead of gay people. You can argue that one usage is more ethically acceptable than another, but I don't think any one group has a particular claim on language.

      That's it exactly. That's what I meant by saying "casual homophobia". It's not direct, but it is fundamentally offensive to use it in a negative context. Like calling something "gay" because you dislike it for some reason. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If it's not a carefree exuberance, man-on-man love, or whatever crap that Madonna has most recently done it's not gay.

      Well, the "their" part was not modified by a conditional, so you could be taken to mean that all black guys or black guys in general are indiscriminately skeezy.

Dragon lover of Sean Connery. Phrase originated when Sean Connery impressions were used to say, "I fuck dragons!" and thus Suzy was born. After further joking, it came to be known that Chuck Norris is the product of Sean Connery and Suzy the dragon. (seriously, if Sean Connery fucked a dragon, what else would happen?)<br/>
Suzy has a myspace for those who need further evidence.<br/>
Sean Connery: Suzy, is that you?<br/>

      Despite the fact that it's deliberately set up in little vignettes, this strip still seems like it's retreading on too many things at once, especially after such a long hiatus, and as a result, comes off as stale. It features erudite references to relatively obscure performers (as opposed to the ebonics-influenced "Web 2.0"-heavy palaver about overexposed celebrities in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101835/https://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=10232008">recent strips</a> , an analogy that betrays the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101835/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=04092003">mental state of its speaker</a> , more of the same  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101835/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=03032008">writer's trick,</a>  and Ray's   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101835/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=02062007">questionable taste in periodicals.</a>  Of late, where has the anything-goes originality that made this comic great in the first place gone?

      After rereading the above and tsk-tsking my own incomplete bracket (manual bbcode tends to make me forget where I am in a sentence), the thought came to mind that maybe I was letting nostalgia for "the better strips of yore" cloud my judgment of both them and the more recent postings. For science, I clicked on the random comic button, and got  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101835/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=12272004"> this</a> . The next couple of strips chronologically are all completely different but equally entertaining, except maybe the map of Achewood, which serves as effective world-building. This stream of excellent stand-alone strips continues until the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101835/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua2qR3R7">Two Thousand Flushes party</a> , which deals with as many distinctive personalities as the latest posted strips do, except (in my opinion, at least) funnier. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If the next book project is indeed a reprint of the first year with added material tossed in here and there, and provided that the next bunch of strips are either going to be days apart or otherwise like the ones we've seen recently, then maybe Achewood has in fact passed its prime. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I'd love to be proven wrong.

      Aw, come on. We're all supposed to be friends here, no? I hope so. And if you can't talk about your problems with invisible internet people, who can you talk to? I don't mind people helping each other out and talking stuff out. I think it's nice that random people can come here and not be judged (unless they break the number 1 rule of Assetbar: No one should be a cock to a stranger, ever). But I dunno. I feel like some of the warm fuzzies here have been replaced with the cold pricklies lately. <br/> 
Plus, not every conversation can be "Reference!" "Reference?" "Reference, reference. Reference!" <br/> 
I don't know. The last thing I wan to do is be the "OMG assetbar jumped the shark!!1!one1eleven!" guy, but... I dunno. Lame me if you want, if you think I'm being a downer or whatever. But is anyone else feeling it, or is it just me?

      Well, I don't think every post should be a series of acceptably alternative references or anything; but a balance of maybe some original humorous content, strip commentary, the references, and even the occasional clever anecdote that can somehow be connected (however tenuously) to the strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just noticed the last few strips, a trend towards just complaining about your life.   Maybe I just can't relate; I'm a Ray or a Pat, and not at all a Roast Beef, after all. <br/>

      actually, i agree with autrepoupee, even though i am totally guilty of initially jumping into the fray with my "experiences". i said what i said cuz falseprophet sounded down on himself, but all of assetbarworld is getting really depressing and i kind of wish i never said anything in the first place. not that everyone wouldn't have taken off even if i didn't, but i probably contributed some momentum.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
like what started out as one man's problem has turned into a free-for-all with everyone trying to compete over who has the most problems. what do you get if you win, huh? everyone will take a step back, inhale sharply, and say "christ, you really are the most pathetic and lonely dude on assetbar" and then you will... be happy?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i liked it better when people were cleverly being dicks to each other. seeing a group of grown men mollycoddling each other is a bit vomit-inducing. then again, what is achewood if not a strip about cats with strange cares expressing them to the delight of others? i'll bet you 90% of assetbar identify more with roast beef than any of the other characters. up til now, they've able to keep their patheticness in check because roast beef was singlehandedly pathetic enough to make them all feel better about themselves. but now he's more or less contently married. and cornelius is getting into a thing. i surmise this has been a silent rage building in a lot of the readership, who are all goddamn it now who's going to make me feel better about all my problems??? the only way i see this being abated is with a reemergence of pathetic roast beef through complaining about the trials of marraige (there's already been hints), and i REALLY don't want to see achewood go down that road. i swear, if RB and molly have a kid and start complaining about it i WILL up and leave. well, i'll still read it probably, but damned if i'm not scowling the entire time. maybe this is onstad's message to all of us that we need to.. stop being pathetic, get a lover, and enjoy life?  <br/>

      As pathetic as some of people might seem on assetbar, it's a rare breed and not a proud one that is really measuring their lives against a cartoon cat like Beef.  Give a geek an inch and he'll try to be Carl Lewis, no matter the background. <br/>

      this is a comic about a cat who sucks (plus he's got depression), a bear that sits in his underwear, playing songs by the Smiths at ladies in chatrooms, and Lyle. <br/> 
 <br/> 
it's pretty much tailor-made for the "MY GIRLFRIEND"/"WHY DON'T I HAVE A MY GIRLFRIEND EVER" type of degenerate

      I just "caught up" with the entire archives! In this strip! Go figure! <br/> 
Actually, this is pretty damn cool. Now, I don't know if I'm going straight through again right away, or if I'm going to venture the waters of webcomics once more in search of a new fix before I return to this land of Achewood that feels like home. <br/> 
On my return, I'll probably find everything is buried under billions of inane comments about  <em>nothing</em> , people. <br/> 
Anyway, see ya'll. I'm kinda sick of a lot of you. And if anyone ever wants to vote on who's the coolest poster ever on all of Acheworld, my vote is for xiaomimi. Yes, even cooler than onstad.
