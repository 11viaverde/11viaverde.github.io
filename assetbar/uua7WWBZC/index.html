      Misleading statement. <br/> 
The penis of a blue whale isn't itself blue. <br/> 
It is a similar shade of pink to a cat's anus, but less hairy. <br/> 
It is also longer than a horse (a whole horse) and can shoot many gallons of ejaculate. <br/>

      You can lame me all you want, but I kind of liked that movie. Sure, huge letdown, but I still enjoyed it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, according to wikipedia: <br/> 
"Carvey may hold the distinction of being the only comedian ever to be imitated by a former President of the United States at the funeral of another former President of the United States. At the January 2, 2007 funeral of Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush reminisced in his eulogy about how Ford took it in stride when SNL's Chevy Chase made Ford the object of his own imitations. Bush cited this as a valuable lesson in learning to laugh at one's self as a part of public life. "I'd tell you more about that," Bush continued, "but as Dana Carvey would say, [imitating Carvey imitating him] 'Not gonna do it! Wouldn't be prudent!'"."

      When the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels were still a mere fancy in our minds, and the Curse of the Black Pearl was  <em>the</em>  movie to watch over and over again, some friends and I discussed what the sequels would or could or should be.  The only solution, in my mind, was the obvious one: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jack and Will find out about Barbossa's vast buried treasure, but they have to find out more from contacts in Tortuga or there's a voodoo curse that stops them from getting the gold themselves or something, so they have to dig up the Captain's rotting corpse and pretend like he's still alive.  Is obvious choice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thus: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Weekend at Barbossa's</em>

      Beautiful! I think I would have preferred your sequels to the ones they  <em>did</em>  make.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I've had similar experiences with Totino's Pizza Rolls. When you're hungry for them it seems like you can sit down and eat a whole 80-count bag, but around 20-25 the world starts sloshing and gurgling around you, and somewhere in the 30s you sink into a kind of green hell-trance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway. I leave you with this thought:  <em>Gentlemen Prefer Barbossa</em> .

      Hmm, that could explain Ray's motives for running.  He knows that his dad votes, maybe he's seeking the attention and support that he lacked as a child... <br/>

Of course, Ramses is too hard for nepotism.  He'd probably vote for Ray's opponent to instill some character from afar.

      Ach, Ramses doesn't seem to me to be a tactical voter, even if it is for reasons of Moral Learning. <br/>

As a true badass, he weighs up the candidates and makes a reasoned decision based on the issues at hand. He might vote for Ray. He might not. But the fact that  Ray is his son will not sway him one bit. To take that into account would be  <em>silly</em> . It would be a  <em>silly</em>  vote.

      It is specific, as is vreeeee's example.

In panels 4 and 5, we no longer see the mirror view, but are looking directly at her.  She has switched the handset to her right hand, as well.

      Men's buttons are on the right because knights held the lance in their right hands while jousting.  The left side of their armor had to overlap the right side, or else it would catch the tip of a lance and direct it into the chest, killing the knight.  Women's buttons are on the left because that's the opposite of the fashion for men (read: knights who about doing violent things). <br/>

That's what I heard, anyway.

      Yeah, pretty much correct, except men didn't dress themselves. Nope, those austere gentlemen had pages to do it for them. The reason the buttons were on the right side is because men drew their swords on the right, and they didn't want it catching. And fuck the page. (On that note, does anyone get a severe feeling that being sent off to be a page is a condemnation to years of being terror-laid? Maybe it's just me, but I am certain that those boisterous old lords saw any creature with a high enough voice as raping material after a few drinks.) So...yeah, it's a combo.

      I had an elementary teacher named Sondra, I believe in third grade. Real nice lady, the daughter of German immigrants. Similar hairstyle and glasses, though, and were she to call me now and tell me I can't be President I'd probably abide by her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fun fact: I once unintentionally stole a Transformers 'Choose-Your-Own-Adventure' novel from her class. To this day I feel terrible about it.

      regret is the first step to rehabilitation, but you sir (or indeed mandam, either way it doesnt matter to me or the good people of this message board) have commited a crime that is beyond pardon. the theft of literature is oen thing, but to steal an interactive cartoon series cash in form a hallowed educational establishement is to rob the education of thousands and in the words of John Stewart Mill "That is robbing the Human race, posterity as well as the present generation" and that sir (or madam) is despicable. <br/>

      John Quincy Adams was something of an asshole, for real, and he straight up had no problem with telling you that. I believe I read a quote from him that said, "I am not one who is ready to show compassion to strangers. I am not sociable. I have little need for good graces or for shallow shows of affection, all of which have overtaken the minutes of the day until most of one's time is spent reassuring someone they have never met before that they are well-liked, and consequently very little is accomplished at all." <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's from memory, so it may be off a little, but he was a real bad-ass.

      Kind of nice not to see Onstad (or "The O man" as i'm sure he is affectionately known by his household staff and clients) Isnt going to be tied down by the X runs for president arc every four years, dont get me wrong this was a good arc, but i'm worried about the "Teodor runs for california state congress for the progressives in the the 2010 mid-terms" arc this pattern could inevitably lead to.

      I was listening to NPR this morning. Apparently some people don't want to vote for Obama because they are afraid he'd get assassinated. This was sort of a preoccupation for me as well. But I figure another high-profile racially motivated political assassination is exactly what this country needs to tip us into the brink of anarchy and revolution.

      If you ask me,  <em>that</em>  is terrorism. Yeah, thousands of human beings died because of the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, but the legacy of racism is so long and storied in this country that this fear will come up whenever a candidate like Obama steps up for centuries to come.

      Sorry, I kinda wanna explain what I am thinking? Is that OK? Do you mind? <br/> 
 <br/> 
In my mind, the best arcs (all of them) dealt with some pretty surreal subject matter--your subaru brat in hell, for instance--and adding a normal human element to it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is more of a satire or a commentary, I think, then a truly original surreal & bizarre concept, so for me, it falls a little flat. I am really looking forward to more bizarre story arcs.... fake manes, wearing cups full of water around the waist, etc.

I've been keeping an eye on your comments in this assetbar of ours. They're wonderful. Everyone must really like you. Keep up the good work. <br/>

      There are at least three comments from 2 days ago above that echo similar sentiments, as far as I can tell.  Just do a "Find" search in your browser for "nephew" and/or "l.n." and you'll see.

      Honestly this was my favorite of the arc so far. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This one and the first one... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like pretty much EVERY arc, but I think maybe, for me, the idea of ray becoming president is just too real & not at all the bizarre surreal adventure that achewood usually provides... a 5 year old otter going to the super secret ice cream shop, or to the trash dump to rescue the couch? Buying AirWolf? Cartilage Head, Stoned Lightning, I mean, heck, I could write these out all day, and you don't care. None of you care at all. Forget you guys.
