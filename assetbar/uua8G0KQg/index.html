      I think it's worth pointing out that that paragraph gramatically says that Ray hasn't successfully "described that awkward phase in a band's life" since he did it about Judy Blume. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Which means there have been other, failed attempts. <br/>

      put a different way, but meaning the same thing, the sentance says "ray smuckles has not succeded in describing that akward phase in a band's life when it becomes a woman, since Judy Blume." <br/>

      This happened to my mother due to her being an athlete during her teenage years, which I'm told can result in not stunting, but holding off puberty and endocrine activity for a few years (see Olympic gymnasts.  The older ones, not the 12-year-old ones). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Resultingly, she didn't have me until she was 42, and I seem to be fine and not Downs syndromey at all.  But then it gets more confusing because surely developing later would not stop your ovaries from ageing, which is the problem in the first place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have no idea why my mother told me this.

      The risks associated with women having children late in life, is not related to when they became sexually mature, but to her age. Eggs are formed in a girl's ovaries before she is even born, and no more are made in the course of her life. Certain genetic defects, such as that which causes Downs' Syndrome, are caused by DNA degradation, which occurs in all cells in our bodies. The difference with egg cells is that they are  made only once and cannot be repaired - other cells in our bodies die and are replenished.

      "Katherine, heading for her senior year in high school, finds herself strongly attracted to Michael, a friend's friend, after a party. As their relationship unfolds, the issue of sex comes up early on, more as an emotional and health issue than as a moral one. Both of them are aware that physical intimacy is both common and complicating. Michael has been sexually active, Katherine hasn't. Their relationship progresses slowly; they are accompanied on various meetings by her friend, Erica, a grounded, practical wit who has known Katherine all her life and believes that sex is a physical thing not a romantic thing, and Michael's friend, Artie, who, with Erica's help, explores and acknowledges some uncertainty about his own sexual orientation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When they do, by mutual consent, have sex in Michael's sister's apartment, they are sure it seals a love that will be "forever." However, separated for the summer by work that takes them to two different states, Katherine finds herself aware of the limitations of the relationship and ultimately attracted to a tennis instructor, older, more experienced, and interesting in new ways. She takes responsibility for breaking the news to Michael when he comes on a surprise visit, the summer is over, and Kath recognizes the loss as a stage in movement towards a more complex, probably more satisfying relationships in the future." <br/>

      I was pretty goddamn stunned, too. Largely because I had no idea who or even what Jamiroquai was. My first instinct was that the story was going to be about extreme forms of ethnic names, and then I was completely thrown by the use of the pronoun "it."

      The ending of the book culminates in Jamiroquai realizing that the awkwardness of becoming a woman is overshadowed by the amazing ability to move so fast that one never sees its feet. The ending scene of the annual junior Spring Fling features Jamiroquai dancing its blues away--the final theme being that it knows this boogie is for real.

      Aerosmith on the other hand, grew up a very confused band, its puritan parents shaming it in matters of the flesh. After years of inner torment, documented in the confessional song 'Dude Looks Like a Lady', the band finally found inner peace when it had a sex change in the late 80's and celebrated by releasing 'Crazy'.

      Blume formed her comma culling cult sometime in the early 1960s. She was young, fresh out of NYU, and ready to educate. Everything was great. Then, a sidewalk ruined her. Only a broken toe, only a broken toe, but as the doctor set the bone, Blume set her mind. That upraised block on the walk, why, commas were no better than it. No, there were worse. They were stubbing the minds of the citizens of earth.
