      Well my house is about 1km from the sea, and roughly 55m above sea level, so I'm going to assume the AP was about 101.3 kPa. The temperature was roughly 20°C. The paper was standard Reflex White A4, and the amount used was 18 square centimetres. The vinegar was Cornwell's White, and the vessel used was an open glass container, properly cleaned. <br/>

      And Martha Stewart Living offers some delightfully tactful handkerchiefs which, when wetted with tears, break down into a rosemary-lemon potpourri which can then be placed in or near the casket.

      I noticed that too. At first I thought it might be a boy scout-style precaution against cutting his own fingers, but then I realized that if he was worried about such things he wouldn't be cutting toward himself. Then I thought that maybe at the point of the perpendicular cut the paper takes on some special property that shouldn't be touched with the fingertips, but it seems his fingertips are involved in the next panel. I settled on the same conclusion you reached: Cartilage Head is quintessentially creepy and does things in strange ways that we are not to understand.

      I always feel like life insurance is a brilliant thing for a grieving other.  I mean, one of my close friends died recently, and I wish there'd been something in place so that I could have just shut myself in and friggin' grieved properly without having to worry about bills and such.  If it'd been my husband, there isn't any kind of way I'd be doing much in the way of self-supporting during such time as I'd be busy busting out in tears at seemingly random moments. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So yeah, I don't think it'd really help in that way, other than not adding a financial burden on top of the actual sadness. <br/> 
 <br/> 
[disclaimer] I don't actually think about this on a regular basis, but it's been a really fucking heavy summer for me.

      It was even worse in the days (the days are still here for many families) when women stayed home to care for children.  When the old man died, there was no income.  They would go on stamps.  Little children, no shoes.  Just because papa bear got heart problems.  300K properly invested can make a pretty passable life for someone in that situation.  A policy that covers that much isn't too hard to get. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, in situations where you have double-income, no kids (DINKs), life insurance is a dumb idea.  You would be far better off just using the money outright

      It's just that I've become a bit kitten-obsessed lately.  My friends have this little fluffball who lost her mother at two weeks (she's now five or six weeks older).  She's the cutest thing.  I run my finger over her back and she closes her eyes and PURRS.  I offer her a bottle of kitty formula and she goes APESHIT, all grabbing at it with her paws, wide-eyed and scrabbling, mewling piteously whenever I take it away.  I just...I love that cat, okay.  Don't judge me.

      I'm fascinated by one aspect of body language: when, in a play or due to drag-king related hi-jinks, a woman tries to act like a man, one thing she always does is put her hands on her hips. However, in reality that is a far more common gesture for women (like walking with arms crossed, though I think that may be something to do with breasts). Where did women get the collective idea that hands on hips is a masculine gesture. Did they learn it in PSE?

      Males standing hands on hips was much more common in 19th and early 20th centuries (I speak from a anglo-centric perspective.) This, and arms crossed, was often a statement of resistance as in a picket line. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There may be an evolutionary element since folded arms make the upper body appear larger and arms akimbo makes the whole torso appear larger. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For women it may be more a statement of assertiveness than aping a man, but I agree there is often a breast issue. I know if half the population spent most of their time looking at my chest I'd be looking for cover too.

      Yeah, I'd agree that it's the whole thing of taking up more space.  When I cross my arms across my chest, sometimes it's because I'm being overly conscious of my breasts.  Sometimes I just want to knwo that they're still there.

      I just realised - every one of Achewood's characters who has gone to the afterlife and come back is a cat - Beef, Ray, Molly (and family), Charley.  <br/> 
No-No looked like some kind of cat, and Trouble Man  <em>might</em>  have been one (not that these two seem to have left the afterlife). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just a coincidence, or is it only cats that have the ability to recorporate, due to their multiple lives? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Possibly a moot point in this case, as Beef is being Hastened off to the queue of Samsara. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, vinegar and brown paper are a folk-lore remedy for a broken crown. Not sure if this has any relation to vinegar and white A4 being used to Hasten...

      Hitler would cobble together some terrible excuse, and stick to it religiously. If anyone ever bought it up, even in a really jokey affectionate way, he'd throw a huge paddy, and storm out of the restaurant or pub.

      He's also been caught slumped over the wheel of his staff car, photographed apparently sleeping at traffic lights in Berlin. He awoke after someone knocked on his window for five minutes, and was "sweating heavily and had his iPod on". He drove away weaving, and then hit a traffic bollard. Later the same month, he was questioned by police after colliding with three cars in the strasse in which he lives.

      I love that trippy wallpaper background. Upon closer inspection, however, I realize that it is the exact same background in frames 1-5 and 8. Probably Onstad was lazy, as the background does change in the two previous strips in which we see it. But a more interesting idea is that Cartilage Head has magic, perspective-changing wallpaper. It's like one of those paintings where the eyes follow you, only it's a crazy-ass wallpaper.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In conclusion, I want one of those.

      I predict that CH is going to hold Roast Beef's hands and drink the confetti.  CH's body being made of cartilage, perhaps it is malleable such that his hands can 'take on' the lash of thanatos simply by being pressed against Beef's hands. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Beef awakes mysteriously in his own bed the next morning, thinking he's dead, until he finds a note in his shirt pocket from CH and finally figures out what happened, and figures out that Teodor and Ray are in hospital, having been rescued by the 5-0.  Somehow or other they figure out that the pamphlet which contains the key to Beef's long-term viability is what rearranged Ray's noggin, and there ensues a hilarious Seinfeld-like wild goose chase to find it.  Agents of the SUV maker have hauled away the SUV in a bid to cover up any possible evidence of a mechanical or design defect in the beast, and it all climaxes in a car chase with a van and Mr. T. and Airwolf and they get there just in time to shut off the crusher which has already partly crushed the SUV.  They retrieve the CH pamphlet from the half-crushed SUV, and it's doused in week-old sauce that burst forth from KFC honey mustard packets, and then our comrades have a hearty laugh as Todd tumbles out of the glove box covered in honey mustard and his own vomit, wearing a tactical vest stuffed with mini pipe bombs, drunkenly brandishing a Todd-size samurai sword and screaming angrily at everyone "WHATCHULOOKINGATWILLS!" as the frame freezes in an ending reminiscent of Francois Truffaut's Les Quatre Cents Coups.

      Glad, I am a female, I am definitely n2 fascinating people; send me a Twitter name or an email address and let's correspond.  Even if you're not Onstad (although the 'i--' is an interesting literary device that Onstad would use; either way, I approve heartily).  And, happy 20th birthday, belatedly!   <br/>

Also:  to Assetbar douches who restrict new posters to one comment per 'day', when a new strip doesn't go up for a WEEK, that's a long time to go without commenting.  Sheesh.  Guess this is my one allowed comment for the next however long. :}

 <strong>Translation:</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>I did elope to Finland over the weekend.  It was my best day.  I did it!  Crazy!  After the lonely times, someone even sang happy birthday to me.  It was wonderful, if I do say so myself.<br/>
<br/>
Tires screamin' during the motor race, second [second-place contestant] on my heels in the corner.  Off the brakes, zoom in the best manner.<br/>

 <br/> 
 <strong>Commentary:</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glad decided it was time to live life to the fullest.  He moved to Finland, got married, and became a race car driver, all in the same weekend.  And that was only the beginning.  After winning the big race, he ate a whole donut, with a candle on top to celebrate his birthday.  Bavarian cream, people.  Bavarian.  Freaking.  Cream.  Because that's how Glad rolls.
