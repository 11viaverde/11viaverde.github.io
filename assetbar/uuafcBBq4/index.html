      You know what?  Fuck everyone who thinks orofacial herpes is that bad.  You know how many people in the general population got herpes?  A good majority, that's what.  You know who almost always definitely has herpes?  People who work in a hospital.  That's right...they get it from contact with surfaces.  You know why people think herpes is that bad?  Because of stigma.

      At first I was also dissapointed in Ray. I spent some time thinking about it though, and I have to support what Ray is doing. When he tells Teodor he feels bad about it, he's serious. The end of the previous strip has a little *snif* when Ray decided he has to take down Philippe, it struck me as a not really almost crying, but definately a reflection of sorrow. Look how stressed and unhappy Philippe is now, up all night trying to think up new products. Ray's putting Philippe's company out of business so he can go back to being a carefree happy 5 year old.

      The thing is, Ray ain't had no hard-knock life, coming up.

 <br/> 
Beef, on the other hand, totally had a 'rocks tied to feet as shoes' upbringing.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is Beef better because of his Circumstances or in spite of them? I dunno.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I do know is that Ray is having some mad hypocrisy on the subject of kids being edified by comin' up hard knocks.

      You're all a bunch of Boden mummies letting your children express their creativity in the form of loud repetitive shouting while I try to buy gin in Tescos.  <br/> 
I am entirely of Ray's camp. Children do not have the right to establish uncontested monopolies in the area of mail order gifts and novelties. The fact that you people think that they do shows just how great the problem has become. My little cousin tried to make a cake out of raw flour, sugar, and tangerine segments. Did our local bakery shut down so the child could feel validated. It did not. It stayed open, my cousin went to play in the garden, and my aunt thew the gluey mess into the bin. <br/> 
The only people who think it is a terrible thing to make a child cry are those who have never been near a child. I knew a small girl who cried because her father threw out an old kitchen flannel. It's people like you who are raising a generation who go on Pop Idol and act all surprised when Aretha Franklin doesn't walk out from behind a curtain and crown them Archduke of Music.

      I know, and I was some of those things.  I was precocious at least; I didn't whine or cry too much because my parents taught me, in a reasonable way, that that is just something you don't do.  Likewise with brattiness.  I didn't piss my pants but I guarantee I was a sticky child because all children are.  I'm trying to make up for what I was back then for unfairly casting aspersions on that whole age group.

      While the words that Ray says are a valid social criticism, they do not apply to his actual actions here.  He's not giving "tough love" here, he is unambiguously stabbing Philippe in the back.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It would be like a father teaching a young man about the capriciousness of male-female relationships by stealing his girlfriend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Think back to when Philippe ran for President.  Ray yanked on his own testicles to save the kid's feelings there, which is certainly a good example of wearing the proverbial kiddie-gloves (this brings up a question, as mentioned below, of whether the current behavior is out-of-character for Ray).  But there's quite a lot of space between that and running a smear campaign against his candidacy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Should we paint the world to be sunshine and lollipops to children, who are honestly pretty obnoxious most of the time? Fuck no.  This does not mean we should go out of our way to be cocks to them.

      I would agree with you in any other situation, but I'm positive that Ray wouldn't seek to make Philippe fail, or make money on his expense. So I have a sneaking suspicion that this was Ray's plan from the very start. <br/> 
 <br/> 
No successful entrepreneur has ever succeeded on their first business venture. I'm sure Ray knows this. His plan was to have Philippe start a business only to fail in the end, with the purpose of teaching him that not all businesses are successful, and that despite our failures we need to keep trying to succeed.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's probably more important of a lesson than any of Ray's other business knowledge, and if he hadn't taught it, he wouldn't be a very good mentor, would he?

      Kids don't need "toughening up".  Well, a bit.  What they really need is better parenting.  Parents who take responsibility for teaching a child how to behave, who care and listen and do their damn job.  Parents who actually  <em>raise</em>  the child. <br/>

Fuck off, you little 20 year old shit.  I know what you're trying to do, but don't even pretend that you have any fucking clue what it's like to raise a child.   <br/>

I don't have kids, thank god, but I have people I know and love who have them, and what I've come to realize is that, ultimately, there's nothing full of more bullshit than childless people talking down parents.   <br/>

      but if you're childless then how do you know you don't know? ?  Isn't the whole premise of your argument that a childless person can not know? ?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, sharing your opinion doesn't do much for me... I don't know you...  It would be better if you shared the reasoning behind your opinion.  Basically I expect that your reasoning is going to be that people without friends with children can't know...

      I didn't say I could raise a child completely.  I said not everyone is dumb enough to completely destroy a little copy person of their self within hours of birth.  And I'm sure you've thought the same of obviously bad parents, it's undeniable.  I've never been a governor or mayor or president, but I can react badly to one if I feel they're not doing a good job.  That's called an opinion.

I even mostly agree with you, having no children I have  <em>no fucking clue</em>  how hard it must be.  I don't really want to find out, either. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But like nice-on-water said, people don't magically get smarter when they have kids, and they don't magically develop a behavioral compass that lets them detect when a child is or isn't being raised well.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, I don't have kids, and don't want them.  But I know a kid that's out of control when I see one (or, more often, hear one).  And in some cases, I've been close enough to the family in question to see the parent(s) doing a piss poor job, too.  I can tell this is so when I see a mother yell at her children to stop jumping on the furniture, only to be ignored.  She threatens punishment, is still ignored, does not actually deliver said punishment but instead gives up and goes outside for a smoke as the kids continue jumping on the furniture.  There is no authority in that relationship, no respect in either direction.  The relationship is reluctant and custodial on the mother's part.  This bothers me, and I see it as poor parenting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again, this is not what we're talking about anyway.  We all know the above example, or the Parable of the North Face Mom who thanks her child for ceasing to throw food at her, are bad parenting.  What we're arguing about is my right as a non-parent to say so.  For my part, I think that not being a parent is insufficient to invalidate my opinion, and that since I get caught up in bad parents' shenanigans because I'm related to those bad parents, I have as much right to bitch about it as anyone else who has to endure Jayden throwing fries at them in a wipe-down Italian restaurant.   <br/>

      Right.  I can acknowledge an overwhelmed parent, and I can't even begin to relate with that massive responsibility because I've never had anything close to it, and it's a damn shame when it happens, it is.  But downright negligent parents shouldn't be put on a pedestal just because they are parents.  To some people it's like they're brave just because they had kids, ignoring the parenting part, which takes much more bravery, I'd wager.  Any horny 14 year old can have unprotected sex; that's not bravery.

      Don't sweat it too much.  It's true the ability for basic self-reflection and insight is vital if you want to be a responsible, self-controlled and consistent parent, but it's also completely idiotic to expect that's the way it's going to play out.  The main credentials for being a good parent are to be resourced enough to ensure you have time to spend with your kids.  If you're working shitty hours all week to make ends meet, your kids will drag themselves up.  If you put in the time, your kids will let you know where you need to be putting more effort in - it all comes out in their basic behaviours when they're little, and when they're older they'll just tell you what they want.  All you have to do is work out whether or not that's reasonable and take it from there.  Humans are pretty high functioning at an early age, and generally a lot more affectionate at this stage too, so it's not all bad.  Just hard work.

      @ ratacattt <br/> 
 <br/> 
While your statements on wealth distribution are generally true on paper, mere comparison doesn't necessarily prove injustice (or inability).   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Wealth is generally defined by economists as assets minus liabilities.  Someone with a $30,000 per year who spends frugally and lives within their means may be more wealthy than someone with $100,000 who incurs serious deficit spending to live lavishly.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've seen this firsthand in the inner city.  Many families who could otherwise afford to support children often spend foolishly.  They order pizza for dinner five nights per week, stock up on groceries at a local 7-11, and buy big screen plasma TVs with 40  DVD collections to go in their ramshackle homes.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not denying the existence of the truly destitute.  However, more education on stewardship in homes and schools would go far to ensuring that children can receive the resources they need for success.

      or at least obfuscating it.  also, distracting from the point that there is a huge wealth gap, and this does contribute in innumerable ways, both blatant and subtle, to a lower quality of life for pretty much all kids in the U.S., and you could easily go far as to argue that this contributes to death and destruction for millions of people worldwide; if American kids weren't quite so dense, they might not be off merrily engaging in that boondoggle of a humanitarian catastrophe that is Iraq...  Maybe some warm and fuzzy PSAs could be run to clue the kids into the idea that they're each spending over a million a year of their descendants money for no purpose other than to waste their own lives and the lives of those who are caught in the Iraq quagmire... I wonder how such a PSA would go... I bet I could write a good one...  mine would be rather direct, and would include the phrase "fucking nimrod..."

      In 1924 a genius by the name of Clifford Hugh Douglas invented a new form of government called "Social Credit."  Social Credit solves all the problems we as a nation now face.  Robert Heinlein's first novel, unpublished in his lifetime, called "For Us the Living" is a poor read, but an amazing description of how life in the United States would be a totally workable utopia under a Social Credit government.  Google and read!  I did, and I have been converted from a life-long Libertarian to a Social Crediter.  I still can't believe that I would ever abandon  Libertarianism, but Social Credit opened my eyes.

      Not that I have abandoned the social freedoms guaranteed by Libertarianism.  Those are sacred, and held as so by Social Credit, as much as by any version of Libertarianism.  Social Credit would end poverty, and yet, because it is not Socialism, would do a better job of encouraging private enterprise then Capitalism.  <br/>

      from what i read, it sounds like another great economic system devised by someone who has never created or run a business. it's like libertarianism and socialism had a weird, ugly, dead baby. you should definitely go back to the free market system (which is not at all what we have today, incidentally) because it would solve all the problems presented by this philosophy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
the bottom line is that when two people want to barter goods, services, work, money, whatever, no one else has the right to tell them how to do it, because their two interests are the only ones directly involved. if someone wants to work in a factory, he should decide if the wage is worth his time. if it's not, he should find another job. if he can't get another job, he should get more skills.  he doesn't 'deserve' money in any sense beyond what his time, skill, or intelligence will command in a free market. whether he is able to buy what he produces is entirely irrelevant. if he thinks he can run a better factory, he should take the enormous risk of getting a business loan (like the other guy probably had to at some point) and try to compete. if he doesn't want to, he should figure something else out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i had a socialist friend who worked at a subway and complained that if he churned out ten sandwiches in an hour, he should at least get most of the $50 or so that was paid for them, because he was the one doing the work. i pointed out that all of the components of the sandwich belonged to the employer, that people were only coming into the store because of advertising paid for by the employer, that if someone got sick from one of the sandwiches the employer, not him, would be sued and be shit out of luck, that if the sandwich market suddenly tanked the employer would lose his business and probably a lot more than that while my friend could just turn in his apron and look for work somewhere else. business owners take risks and should be rewarded when they do well, and no one else deserves what they earn, no matter how much it is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
of course that applies to a free market, which is unfortunately not what we have today, although i guess selling sandwiches is as close anything going to that. sigh.

explain it to me Randy.  I know you linked to slide show on it many months ago, but that too was a mess that didn't help.  I can do college algebra but I can't understand social credit.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for the free market, no offense, but anyone who thinks the free market is acceptable is an idiot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
yes the business owner takes a lot of risk and should be rewarded for that risk, but the problem is that in the free market, the phenomenon of  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145541/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increasing_returns">Increasing Returns</a>  dictates that the ROI is exponentially disproportionate to the initial risk which translated into plain English means that the factory owner soon comes to own the entire fucking world which is quite a different thing from the naively inaccurate utopian picture painted by free market advocates.  There simply is no such thing as a free market that doesn't result in the majority of society becoming the slaves of the minority of society.  There is no middle class in a free market.  Sorry, but that's just how the math works out.  Put on your dunce cap bobby and go sit in the corner. <br/> <br/> <br/>

      that's awesome logic. i guess that's why everybody just goes out and owns a factory and gets rich and lives on a cloud. douche. <br/> 
 <br/> 
owning a factory in a free market doesn't mean anyone will come to own the world, it just means that he will be able to take his best shot at offering his market the best product he can. as he long as he does a good job, he will continue to thrive. when he stops doing a good job, his company will decline and fail (like GM should have, for example). <br/> 
 <br/> 
the risk inherent in owning a business is enormous. it's why probably almost no one on this board actually owns a factory, even the whiny bitches like yourself who pretend that deciding to own one automatically puts money in your pocket and a crown on your head (if it's that easy, why don't you do it?). <br/> 
 <br/> 
here's the other thing jackasses like yourself can't seem to grasp: they say 1 in 10 small businesses fails in the first year. this is not a random selection; you don't start a business and hope that you get picked to be the one that makes it. the one that succeeds does so because it beat out the others. in other words, the one that gets through that first year has something the others don't--a better product, idea, system, whatever. every successful business in a free market represents a person who has made a positive contribution as deemed by the customers who give their money to that business. so they fucking should be rewarded because they don't sit on their asses and play it safe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
the great thing about a company is that your interaction with them is voluntary--the only way someone in a free market could ever come to 'own the world' is if he's really good at providing everyone with exactly what they want, so much so that they decide to buy everything only from him. if he stops doing that, someone else who comes a long and does it better will gain market share, and take over. <br/> 
 <br/> 
increasing returns to scale in the real business world--and in a free market--only happen when you continue to a good job, and guess what--they aren't a problem, they are what drives innovation and progress, and keep businessmen doing fucking good jobs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
there are no slaves in a free market, because labor is a free market as well. people can earn whatever wage they actually *deserve* according to their skills and abilities. if someone's abilities are not worth more then $8/hour, then $8/hour, or whatever it is, however low or high, is a 'fair' wage, in the original sense of the word.  how can you be a slave if no one is forcing you to work for anyone, and you choose your employer based on the abilities you've developed for yourself? <br/> 
 <br/> 
here's the amazing irony in all of this--you use the word 'slave' to describe workers in a free market society.  but what are you? clearly you don't own a business, or else you wouldn't think what you think, so that means if you are employed that you work for someone else.  you get paid a regular wage, on some scale, in return for the work that you do. you have a reliable stream of income (as opposed to someone who opens a business on his own and only makes money when he's selling). you clearly advocate a more socialist, less free society, where every citizen (except the ones who don't feel like working) must give a large portion of their earnings to their government because they must support government programs or go to jail. so instead of favoring a society where people must stand on their own merit, you prefer taking the fruits of people's labor and jailing them if they fight it--and you yourself refuse to leave you reliable, smaller income, and take a risk and start a business (and then make all that magic, instant money that some economist told you is out there) because the reality is you're afraid of what might happen. so not only are *you* a slave, but you choose to be one, and you like it, and you wish it on other people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
if you want to brand yourself a slave because you think someone, somewhere should be giving you more money for no reason, then that's your business. please don't destroy everyone else's freedom because you can't grow a pair and make the most out of what you've got.

      last time I checked the U.S., where I live, isn't a free market... it's heavily regulated...  If it were a free market, then yes, I would be a slave...  and there would be no middle class... <br/> 
 <br/> 
second point... you don't understand this 'increasing returns' concept.  Look at your keyboard.  QWERT.  This key layout was designed to be as inefficient as possible for the user.  Why are you using it?  Answer:  Increasing returns.  Absent artificial regulation, the free market does not result in the best product at the lowest price.  The free market disproportionately rewards those who come to market first, regardless of how sucky their product is... so much so that a key layout that was designed to suck can not be displaced...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Look also at the A/C distribution system in the U.S.... 110 volts... that's bullshit... it's totally inefficient as compared to 220 volts... The conductors have to be twice as large in a 110 volt system as opposed to a 220 volt system.  220 volts is in this and many other respects less expensive and safer too.  Why do we keep going with 110?  Answer:  In a free market, the up front cost to change from 110 to 220 is too high, even though this cost would more than pay for it's self in the long run.  The essence of the free market is a combination of throwing good money after bad, and the concentration of power in wealth in the hands of a small elite.  The markets in the U.S. are some of the least regulated in the first world, and what do you see, you see wealth disproportionately concentrated in the hands of a few, to the point where much of the population is denied access to basic human rights such as health care.  But hey, maybe if we eschew regulation even more, that will fix things.  maybe.  keep dreaming. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you love free markets so much, why don't you go live someplace where there is artificial regulation in name only, some place like say Nigeria.  See how much you like that.

      i said several times already that we don't live in a free market. how, specifically, would a free market make you a slave? <br/> 
 <br/> 
as for your second point, we use QWERTY keyboards now because we're all used to them. obviously. in a free market, though, anyone can invent a better keyboard and start selling it. if it actually is better, it will replace the QWERTY. the problem with alternate keyboard layouts is for people who are used to the standard layout, an alternate one is not actually better, even if it is in theory more efficient. you are stuck on the idea that it would have been better if everyone had been trained on it in the first place. however, we live in the real world, and in the real world the QWERTY keyboard, being the best known, is the best one.  anyone who wished to change that fact can develop their own keyboard, and if the improvement in performance is worth the effort to switch over, and if that person can demonstrate that as much is true and market it accordingly, then he can become rich and change the norm. <br/> 
 <br/> 
however, no one is going to (successfully) do that because there is no widespread market demand for a better keyboard layout. this is another reason why free markets work--they address actual problems, not theoretical ones, because actual ones need solving and make money, while theoretical ones do not. in a free market the 'problem' of the keyboard is ignored, and other problems that people actually want solutions to are addressed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
the same applies to a/c distribution. because it is the established standard, it is the best option for everyone. what you are concerned with is the idea that if people could have seen the future, they could have planned better. well no shit. but as it is, they came up with what worked best then, and because it became a standard, there was no compelling reason to change.  if you want to custom-wire your own house, and rewire everything you buy, and so on and so forth, you could go for it. but because everyone operates on the existing standard, sticking to that standard makes much more economic sense then forcing everyone to change and making every existing household electrical appliance obsolete.  the guy who can come up with an attractive, workable solution to that can, in a free market, guess what--make a ton of well-deserved money with his solution.  if not one can come up with an answer, then there actually is no good reason to change--not in theory, but in actual practice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
what you seem to be advocating is not any political or economic system, but the ability to see the future. i think we all agree that would avoid a lot of problems and inefficiencies. short of that, i think it's best to let individuals make their own choices, since they are best acquainted with their own situations. <br/> 
 <br/> 
incidentally, government regulation is what *keeps* wealth 'concentrated' where it is right now. furthermore, in a free society, wealth is not distributed, it is earned by people, and since people are different they *should* have different amounts of money. and, health care cannot possibly be a basic human right, because it requires the time and resources of other people, and by definition you cannot have the right to someone else's time and resources without--yup--making that person a slave.  that's not to say that our current health care system (not a free market) is any good, because it's largely not. but regardless of how passionate anyone is about health care or some of the bad situations out there, it can't ever be a basic human right on a strictly logistical level. i'm talking about in the real world, not in theory, because what happens in theory is meaningless. <br/> 
 <br/> 
also, the whole nigeria situation is kind of fucked up as a result of widespread corruption and due to, wouldn't you know it, excessive and unchecked power for the government.

      so okay.. I'll ask you this... with the QWERT... or the 110 vs 220... or the less efficient thing of everyone using their own car, vs public transit... <br/> 
 <br/> 
how much of a country's GNP will be wasted on inefficient ways of doing things before the free market kicks in?  just on a theoretical level?  Since you admit the free market isn't going to always bring about the most efficient system...  you said as much in your incoherent rambling about 110 vs 220...  so I mean, hypothetically speaking, how much of a country's GNP would have to be wasted on the inefficient 110 system before the free market kicks in and causes a shift to 220?  .05%?  5%?  50%??? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now my next question is this...  how do you know that the free market is always right?  I mean, whatever number you came up with in the first question.. say it was 2%... say after 2% of the country's GNP is wasted on 110volts, the country's free market kicks in and causes conversion to 220...  how do you know that there isn't some other paradigm other than the free market which might cause that shift to happen at 1%?   <br/> <br/> <br/> "sticking to that standard makes much more economic sense then forcing everyone to change " <br/> 
 <br/> 
yes... it makes more economic sense in the short term...  You know what else makes more economic sense in the short term?  Pay day loans...  that's right... a loan whose interest and fees amount to 500% of the principle makes sense... UNTIL YOU HAVE TO PAY THE LOAN OFF....  Smoke much crack do you?

      "regardless of how passionate anyone is about health care or some of the bad situations out there, it can't ever be a basic human right on a strictly logistical level. " <br/> 
 <br/> 
other countries seem to manage it, meanwhile the USA manages to spend trillions on wars...  Explain to me why the US is so special that it can't manage to provide everyone with health care while other countries manage it just fine, while spending half as much as we spend on health care...   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm thinking that one solution might be to logistically put a bullet in your head and enough other people who think like you until people like you start to reconsider just what is and isn't actually possible...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
you're pretty dumb, but the sad thing is you don't realize how dumb you are.  You aren't even beginning to have a clue about how dumb and uninformed you are.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's awesome that you understand the political social and economic situation in Nigeria.  How much time have you spent studying the situation in Nigeria?  All of zero minutes?  That's pretty impressive.  I'll bet you understand the situation in all 200  countries in the world.  You have it all figured out.  You're frickin' brilliant.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
You'll have to excuse me if I don't continue trying to answer your queries, but after only a few times back and forth I already have the distinct impression that I'm chasing my tail.  Go read a book or something.

      Yes, First World poverty does spring directly from sloth. Somewhere down the line, somebody was too lazy to do something. Even if Johnny, himself, never did anything to deserve such a shit life, you can bet his father or grandfather was a lazy piece of shit. And even if you are handed a rough lot in life because a lazy ancestor of yours made a life of mistakes, a little initiative can go a long way toward easing your inherited poverty in countries like the ones in which we all live. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Suffice it to say, wherever there is poverty in a First World country, there are lifetimes of poor decision making and laziness to blame. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And if you're wondering, I'm not guessing on this. I didn't hear this in college. I've been seeing it from the inside for as long as my brain has been understanding the things that have been happening in front of my eyes. I was born poor because my parents had monumentally poor decision making skills. I remain lower middle class because I lack initiative. It was their fault that I was born this way and my fault that I remain this way. <br/>

      Yes, I saw this comment on touamb and was wondering when someone was gonna bring it up here. Everyone seems to be arguing if Ray bringing Philippe up hard knocks is the right thing, ignoring the fact that Ray had an EXTREMELY easy childhood and is successful now. Whole thing reeks of hypocrisy. Remember folks, this is the boy whose mother would serve steak fries and duck when he was Philippe's age.

Tangent:  The spell-check in Firefox can differentiate between "all y'all" (correct) and "all ya'all" (wrong), but it thinks "Achewood" is an error.

      Because for the last decade or so the main people in the parenting business have been drawn from the pool of dudes whose big claim to history was proliferating sexually transmitted disease and establishing getting high as the core of social rebellion; who saw the Vietnam War and the fallout of Soviet privatization and said "Hey, that was awesome, when I grow up I want to do it all again but more nihilistic and pointless"; who decided that Ayn Rand was a genius because she called them awesome for sucking and decided the music of the Beatles should last forever because it's what they liked in high school. The only way society could handle these people having children was to treat them like Lennie when he gets in mouse-petting mode and hope enough of the offspring physically survived their years of minority to maintain the vast national psychiatric support system that's sure to be as vital to the beginning of this century as the electrical infrastructure was for the beginning of the last. Encouraging the aging toddlers to beat the crap out of their actual toddlers when they get angry is  <em>not productive</em> .

Pot and LSD got many off the treadmill long enough to re-evaluate careers and work. The rest I don't understand, and would probably be about other groups I didn't interact with.

      Not every Boomer was a hippie, although plenty who were hippies back when they had no money are libertarians now. There is a broad range of cosmetically different philosophies and ideologies represented among the Baby Boomers, the unifying theme behind all of them is self-indulgence and irresponsibility.

      It's a false "generation" anyway, running way too long (1946 to 1964, I believe) and only identified by an increase in the birth rate.  Hardly a good common trait, although useful for predicting school construction, I suppose.  We need to at least talk "Early Boomers" (46-56) and "Late Boomers" (57-64).

      Given that "generation" is sort of an arbitrary concept since people don't come in distinct waves but rather are bein' made pretty consistently all the time, describing the vaguely coherent social phenomenon that comes with a certain set of years works fine for me. 64 is definitely pushing it, though.

      I really wish I had known/realized that when I read the book.  It sort of makes me want to reread it now... but I didn't really like it the first time.  I guess I wasn't able to relate.  Which was weird, being an angsty teenager and all.   <br/>

 <br/> 
WORKING GIRLS <br/> 
THE working girls in the morning are going to work-- <br/> 
     long lines of them afoot amid the downtown stores <br/> 
     and factories, thousands with little brick-shaped <br/> 
     lunches wrapped in newspapers under their arms. <br/> 
Each morning as I move through this river of young- <br/> 
     woman life I feel a wonder about where it is all <br/> 
     going, so many with a peach bloom of young years <br/> 
     on them and laughter of red lips and memories in <br/> 
     their eyes of dances the night before and plays and <br/> 
     walks. <br/>

      Ray isn't being Philippe's friend, he isn't giving him tough love, he is his competitor.  When Phillippe came to him to emulate him, Ray's kid gloves came off and his intrepid entrepreneur hat was put on.  Ray is doing what Ray does, completely in character, he thinks of Phillipe as an equal in this arc, not as some 5 year old friend.  Phillipe did *ask* him to make him like Ray.

      Ray is being pro-Phillipe in the best way he knows how: by showing him the "ropes".  Not some of the ropes.  The full Monty.  Consider: a fellow might give you some instruction in a particular art, but show enough promise to rival him, and it is ON!  Ray is teaching Phillipe.  Not that Ray thought this through, it's how he lives.  After all, who was Ray's role model of a "kindly dad"?  Yeah, that's right.  Nobody. Not Ramses.  Not Beef's Pa, whoever he might be.  Nobody.  So, Ray is just doing what comes naturally, and not in any kind of vicious way: "It's not personal, it's just business."

      Do you think Ray wanted to do this? Do you think Ray is deriving some sick pleasure?  <br/> 
He knows this is what's best for the massive little man. It breaks his heart to do it but he knows he has to. This is not the Ray who signed a cute amount of money for a cute little guy. This is the Ray who mercy killed a deer right in front of Phillipe.

I don't think that Ray is acting out of character at all. This is a guy who called his best friend a butthole because he got engaged to the woman Ray told him to get engaged to. He makes dick moves all the time.

There was a time when a roundhouse kick to the face was "time out" enough, not anymore. When I was six my Dad threw my through a wall, that was an important lesson, I learned not all walls are load bearing, and the ones that are not are just some paper over wood. <br/>

That's SCIENCE. You can't get that from a book, because books are all about Harry Potter and the Sexy Vampire Slumber Party now.

When she was a child, Laura Miller wanted desperately to visit Narnia -- C.S. Lewis' fantastic fictional universe in which animals talk and magic is an everyday occurrence. But when Miller re-read the "Chronicles of Narnia" series as an adult, she felt betrayed and tricked.In this hour of To the Best of Our Knowledge, Laura Miller talks about returning to the Narnia stories to discover the wonder and mysteries they hold for adults.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
SEGMENT 3: <br/> 
 <br/> 
    Kenneth Branagh reads a selection from "The Magician's Nephew," one of The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. And Laura Miller talks with Steve Paulson about her long relationship with the Narnia books. She read them as a child and loved them. Later she was put off by the Christian symbolism, but now feels the book are terrific for believers and non-believers alike. Miller's book about her experience with Narnia is called "The Magician's Book: A Skeptic's Adventures in Narnia." <br/> <br/> <br/>

      Try explaining to a fundamentalist slash evangelical that you're an atheist... Invariably, the concept doesn't register, and they start asking you "Why do you hate God?  Why are you angry at God?" <br/>

There's something about being able to contemplate a perspective that's different from one's own which I guess I just sort of take for granted...

      Look, someone was gonna take Philippe down eventually. It was only a matter of time. Better it be Ray, who at least understands the gravity of what he's doing, than some guy from the internet who cares nothing for Philippe (or worse, Nolan from the Internet, who cares for Philippe in completely the wrong way). Ray knows that what he's doing is going to hurt Philippe, but he also knows that he can use this to help Philippe in the long run. He is like a father who, despite wanting to give everything to his children, refuses them certain pleasures in order to teach them about the world. <br/>

Ray would be a terrible parent on the whole, but he is doing the right thing here.

      So at any point while you were stringing together a sentence connecting the concepts "Ray" and "understands the gravity of what he's doing" did you suddenly get the sensation that something was terribly, fundamentally wrong? Like a vague feeling of unease, maybe, nothing you could place necessarily but something nonetheless distinctly  <em>there</em> .

      I apparently overlooked stereo's response to my comment before; after reading it, I didn't get it at all, and wondered why it was chubbied. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I copied and pasted it into google, put the quotations around it (thanks, professorhazard!) because your comment lead me to believe it was actually a reference to something and not a non-sequitur, and hit search. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I see now that it was an honest and good reference to an Avril Lavigne song.  I'll give it a chubby, too.

I like how Ray can just start a sentence "The parable of..." it's great. Cuts the bullshit. Or not. Still, in Achewood world I feel that Roast Beef is a prime example of how old school parenting did not work. <br/>

      Remember Onstad's trip to Google that didn't end in any way other them him not talking about it any more? I think Google is using Onstad as a surrogate AI - a prototype - for developing an automated feedback/response based improvement of ad and service delivery.  Slowly but surely they'll replace him with computers - and they'll use the forum feedback to see when you call tell if it was auto-generated or when Onstad really made it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They're crowd sourcing the problem of passing a Turing test by tricking tons of people into evaluating a piece of art and evaluating on its subtleties, using their computing farms to analyze comment trends, ratings, etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sometimes they have to spend a lot of time with Onstad to get the specific comic out they want to get a response for, to answer a specific type of question about how people respond to a subtle change in the presentation.  That's when it takes the longest to get the next strip out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's just a theory - but post at your own risk.

      Winston Churchill was actually his day and time's answer to one of those Sniffleprofin types. You want hard, ambitious men who played the game from small times and got toughened up by their drunken, abusive dads, you look at Hitler and Stalin. <br/>

Nobody with a carbon allergy is gonna exterminate European Jewry is all I'm sayin'.

      hi erryone  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I has make beta version of assetbarista which displays images once again <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145541/https://midconet.net/achewoodtest/TEST.assetbarista-1.0-alpha2.user.js">https://midconet.net/achewoodtest/TEST.assetbarista-1.0-alpha2.user.js</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
click on it and it will ask you to install say yes <br/> 
 <br/> 
then maybe you should click on the monkey head and manage user scrip <br/> 
 <br/> 
and then disable assetbarista but leave enable TEST.assetbarista <br/> 
 <br/> 
and then try it out.  when done trying it you can do opposite - disable TEST.asstbarista and enable the regular assetbarista. <br/> 
 <br/> 
still in alpha beta feedback welcoem

      So here I am catching up on old stuff since I now have a functional computer, and I run across sketched stuffed animals acting out what I have recently realized is The Lesson of my childhood (aka "I came from Circumstances as did we all") : Drunk adults with large, loud record players will take away the things they gave you if thy realize you are good at and/or enjoying them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dang. <br/> <br/> <br/> (Being In My Cups, this realization has caused me to create an assetbar profile for the sole purpose of responding to something no one else is looking at any more.)
