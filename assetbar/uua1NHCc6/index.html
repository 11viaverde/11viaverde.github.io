      So this finally gets explained. I was confused as to why Ray knew so much about perverts. Now Beef, that I can understand - the man spends his free time paying attention to the worst aspects of existence.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Children being attacked by feral goats? Beef has written an essay about it. Ruthless slaughters going on in some jungle-infested asshole of the world? Beef has made posters about such things and then deleted them because they didn't pass muster. Tori Amos accidentally clicking on an advertisement and then seeing a tiger give birth to a stillborn cub? Beef has written a poem about it while sitting in the soulless blue glow of his computer screen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
No, it did not rhyme, but it's hard enough to give words to such things.

      It's his money acting as an alienating agent once again - although he could just go over and beat the hell out of Nolan personally, he'd rather use the money in order to have a professional do it.  <br/>

Ray will never do anything if he can have his money do it for him.  <br/>

      I believe Ray did not hire men to kill Nolan. Ray is informing Nolan as if it were true, knowing that a Man of the Internet will cease bringing his perversions into the world not of the Internet once that world looks like it will kill him. I mean, look how long it took him to get over the SaniTaco humiliation.

      On second thought, Nolan probably never knew Philippe was a child.  He found Philippe through Potty Pals, which speaks to a different perversion altogether.  Their e-mail exchange made it clear that Nolan assumed he was dealing with a sex merchant, not a five-year-old who was trying to cheer up constipated old people.  The guys all assumed Nolan was after a five-year-old, but we have not heard Nolan's side. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not that I'd want to shake Nolan's hand at this point.  No telling where that thing has been.

      That's almost exactly what I was going to post until I re-read Beef's line: "bragging all over about how he's gonna have dinner with the kid..."  Yes, that could easily be Beef interjecting his own interpretation of Nolan (that he's a pervert and thus a pederast and the main reason the dinner interests him is the kid aspect, not the Potty Pals founder part), and not Nolan's actual comments, but since it's read and summarized pretty quickly by Beef, I was thinking that's more or less what Nolan was bragging about, "having dinner with a kid."   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, per usual, it's all from the mouth of a cartoon cat, so let's not get too worked up over it.

      You know what's funny? In the last comic one character used the uncommon (almost archaic) "pederast" instead of the more common "pedophile."  In the comments under THIS comic, not one single person up to an hour before this posting deigned to use "Pedophile" once. I think a lot of people learned a new word yesterday, and wanted to give it a spin (or maybe we're all just sick of CNN-ese).

      looking up her name only helps to understand why you shouldn't care about her. <br/> 
although people not knowing who Carol Burnett is makes me feel a little better about not having known who Bela Lugosi was.  I mean, Carol Burnett is still  <em>around</em> , poisoning local television with "reunions" and all such manner of saying "LOOK at ME! I STILL HAVE IT!" whereas Bela Lugosi...well, I don't think I've ever heard his name outside Achewood.

Ray has said in his blog that he does not practice self-gratification, so someone was "on the job" with Ray, whatever the precise nature of the "job" (hand, blow, etc). As I see it, Ray, flushed with triumph and hella feeling it, decided that getting his bone on was the bst way to celebrate. And I agree, Just getting drunk would not be good for his latent diabetes.

      It is indeed a common mistake, but I don't think the usage of "payed" in the alt text was accidental.  I rather suspect that the author used that misspelling on purpose to help emphasize to the reader the monetary sense of the payment.  If he'd written "paid attention," we'd all have assumed that attention was the direct object, when in fact the implied money was the direct object and Attention, as personified by Ray's hired squad of goons, was the indirect object.

      I can see your point. But I don%u2019t like to think he intentionally set out to misspell the past tense of a verb to create some subtle nuance for the reader. I think he just misspelled it. I checked several times before I even made that original post, all thinking %u201Cnah, onstad doesn%u2019t misspell things.%u201D  <em>These things happen.</em>  They just don%u2019t happen often with Achewood.  <br/>  But even if it was an intentional misspelling, it was still a misspelling. <br/>  Which is all I was trying to point out.

      I you think about it, being a "main pervert of the internet" is really quite an achievement. I mean, think of what you'd have to do to stand out from that kind of crowd. <br/>

      I think "main pervert of the internet" is part of Beef's and Ray's idiom, like "basic time of friends."  That is,  I'd guess that a "main time of friends" might a wedding or a reunion, something big that you don't do all the time.  So, if Nolan were a "basic pervert of the internet," he'd just be your run-of-the-mill, everyday type of pervert on the internet.  A "main pervert" is somehow exceptional, but it does not necessarily mean that Nolan is in the top ten of all perverts.

I think it might be a sign of respect...Beef called him by his full name back when he was only five, but now that Philippe is five, the more dignified, shortened version is appropriate. Some day, when he is five, he might even be Mr. Phil.
