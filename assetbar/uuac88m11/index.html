      As much as Family Guy may not be hipster-elitist, I think hating on it may be even less so now that South Park has done it. Just because frat guys enjoy mindlessly repeating Stewie's 'evil' lines does not make the rest of the show bad. You give me another show that's clever enough to make reference to The Picture of Dorian Gray in a one-off joke and I'll give you a chubby.

      I'm having trouble with the exact context, but one of the female characters asks a general question about the quality of her appearance, and Stewie responds with something like "let me put it this way. Somewhere in an attic there is a painting of you getting prettier." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I probably fucked it up, but I'm pretty sure that's what he was referring to. But then again, this is 3 months later and you probably do not care anymore.

this back and forth your commenting on is a year old, back when assetbar came out, and no one posted much, I was just tired of hearing catachresis state is hatered of every comic in a row of 6 or 8. it got old. I knee-jerked. but thanks for attacking me.

      Okay then, I interpreted what you said...weirdly. And it was totally lame that I didn't look at the dates on these things.  <em>That's okay.</em>   <em>I can totally admit that</em> . But beyond that, I stand by what you said. To be perfectly honest, I feel that maybe people should be a little bit more critical of this comic. We know it is great, you can stop posting that, but maybe if someone finds some little detail or something that bothers them, they can mention it. At least that is...interestin'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I am shitty and lame for carrying this on, and if you stop talking you WILL be the bigger man.

      In the first panel I thought Lyle was gearing up for a bird-flip, like that was his middle finger half folded down. Like he was just getting ready to flip off all the inhabitants of the dumbwaiter, or the dumbwaiter itself, or the world at large for being boring. <br/> 
Now I think it is the top of a bottle of bourbon. I don't know whether to be disappointed or think it is awesome that he has brought a bottle with him at all times.

      I can identify with Beef's wanting to resolve these unanswered questions.  The idea of a queef, and the books of T. Pynchon, are things I just can't find anybody to discuss with.  I did get lucky though on the 2 Live Crew discussion regarding the song where they say "Heeyyyyy we want some Pus-Say!"  My friend told me, "they're just saying what they want".  And that made me feel like it wasn't so crass.

      My gf queefed once in high school, I didn't know what a queef was so I started making fun of her for farting. Then she told me what it actually was, and then suddenly I REALLY smelled it. Oh god, it lingers to this day
