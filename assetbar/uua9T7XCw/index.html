      I think you mean "pro ice." An ice pro is a man such as a Zamboni driver, or someone that carves a big block of ice into a creative shot luge.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Additionally, an ice pro can go pro ice, such as when a server who is assigned to chip blocks of ice with a pick decides to commit murder most foul upon his elderly employer for the cash stuffed in her mattress.

      Fail at them. <br/> 
And fail at Killer Instinct too.  <br/> 
That really was a fighting game for people of low mind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can honestly say I would rate almost any of the other fighting games of the era and thereabouts above Killer Instinct. <br/> 
I mean Capcom had top notch. Street Fighter, Darkstalkers and to some extent Cyberbots (since almost vanished into obscurity) were total win. SNK's King of Fighters, Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown and later The Last Blade lot were awesome. The Mortal Kombat games had a passable certain something, despite being riddled with more sprite-clones than you could shake a joystick at. Primal Rage was a personal weakness of mine because I always was a dinosaur fan. Clay Fighters was funny, but I never really got into it because it was too bloody silly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But none of that even could justify Killer Instinct...  <br/>

      I never played Killer Instinct, but I've heard tales of entering a combo and then putting down the controller so as to give the combo time to finish.  I was way into King of Fighters (if that's the one I'm thinking of with the monsters, I remember being good at some sort of giant sea amoeba thing) and in arcades Primal Rage was good for showing people who hadn't seen the game how to eat the little people running around.

      Killer Instinct definitely was for the frame-counting crowd, let me tell you. You are absolutely right about the combos. <br/>
