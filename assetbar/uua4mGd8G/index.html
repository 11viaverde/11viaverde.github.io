      Sweet damn, that is one nice Beverly Crusher right there.  I don't recall her being that smokin'.  Sure, she's only a little bit younger than my  <em>mother</em> , but I figure my wife is eventually going to be that age, so I better get used to enjoying the look of all vintage of ladies. <br/>

      Good call. I actually thought he was holding a gun on someone, getting all ready to engage in bloated Tarantino dialogue. Your view is spot on --- but -- either the Roombas are moving very slowly, or that is one big-ass room, or they're going in circles. The latter would be hilarious, were it animated.

      I get the impression that most of the Rhoomba cartoons exist in an alternate reality that is all hallway. If you go back and look at each one there's no way to fit all that into one house, unless Ray paid the guy who designed the crazy Lovecraft apartment building from Ghostbusters to design his mini-mansion as well.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Which I think is unlikely. Ray doesn't seem like a gargoyle kind of guy.

      So you don't believe that referring to these men as "retards" (not to mention the use of "mi-mocking," wherever the hell  <em>that</em>  came from) warrants the official disapproval of the masses? I'd say seven (wait, make that eight) lames is getting off pretty light.

      To be frank, I wouldn't be surprised if more were coming. Defining the cause of the insult doesn't mean that it's not an insult - it just means that you're bitter and angry enough that you have to  <em>prove</em>  why you thought we were all "retards."

Anyway, Photobucket accounts aren't closed until they've been inactive for a whole year, so lost_buoy's 'shops are still available for the time being. Just right-click and choose "open image in new window" or your browser's equivalent. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Because I'm a gigantic nerd, I've been saving my favourite photoshops to disk, and the recent World Without Assetbar scare has reassured me that this isn't a total waste of time. There's a lot of funny stuff here, and it would be a shame if it all just disappeared.

      The only real distinction that matters is that "whiskey" is Irish whiskey and means it's distilled three times, and "whisky" refers to all other types, Scotch whisky being commonly referred to as, well, "Scotch", and being distilled only twice, although the peat used gives it a much smokier flavor. Also, there are more types of Scotch whiskeys.

      Most but not all American whiskies also use the spelling with the "e".  Whether or no something is triple-distilled is only technically a description of its quality, or compliance with local law, as it were.  I've had vodkas that claimed to be distilled 4 times, and scotches that claim thrice.  I once drank enough whiskey and whisky that I divined the reason for the distinction in spelling.  I think it was a dastardly Fenian plot.  This may or may not be accurate as I tend to ascribe a lot of things to dastardly Fenian plots when drunk.  Or when sober.

      I love Powers. Three years ago when I was still pretty debauched we used to play a game called Super Powers. It was magnificently complicated, but I'll try and sum it up here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. Find one other person, preferably a friend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. Obtain two bottles of Powers whiskey. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. Sit down with friend and drink the whiskey. <br/> 
 <br/> 
4. In the morning the one who has no external injuries wins. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Everyone usually lost at Super Powers. I guess I thought it was magnificently complicated was because, at its inception, I was staggeringly drunk at the time.

      Oh yeah that's good stuff.  I have drunk maybe a hundred bottles and I never get tired of it.  I gave some to my little brother, who lives in a considerably drier jurisdiction than mine.  His fiancee banned me from giving him any of the booze I like because he ended up taking off all his clothes and getting in a shouting match with the elderly woman next door, during the middle of a snowstorm.  He was definitely not scared of the motherfucking police.  The genius of Powers is that it is just harsh enough to make you know you're drinking, but smooth enough so that you don't really want to stop until you've lost consciousness. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It exists at a sweet spot in the continuum of booze.

      Whiskey is indeed a harsh and sultry mistress. You little brother's incident sounds familiar. Fistfights, being banned from restaurants, climbing trees and making bomb threats, and, yes, furious shedding of clothes all can be found in my drinking repertoire, all under the influence of that sweet poteen from Ireland green, distilled from wheat and rye.

      Mc, Mac and O' are all used in Ireland. Mc and O' are very commonly used, and while Mac is used more often in Scotland, you do see it used in Ireland, particularly by people who use the Irish language version of their name e.g. Seamus Mac Mathuna instead of James McMahon. It comes from the Irish word for son: mac. <br/>

      That doesn't seem right.  "Mc" and "Mac" would surely be Scottish for "son of", as the Irish is "O'", but in the past few hundred years (after the development of the two convergent versions of Gaelic - Scots and Irish, not counting all the now dead dialects)there has been a large influx of Scottish immigrants into Ireland (I would assume in Northern Ireland with its English influence, with the Scots sent there due to English occupation of more of Scotland), hence resulting in a large amount of "Mc's" and "Mac's". <br/> 
 <br/> 
So thus, and I'm just spitballin' here, while "Mc & Mac" aren't  <em>originally</em>  Irish, they well and truly are now. <br/>

      Sorry to be the one to pull the trigger, but 'Ó' in Irish refers to grandson, or just general descendant. 'Mac' is son of, and is originally Irish. The Scottish 'Macs' who came to Ireland over the years were descended from Irish who'd gone there hundreds of years before (mostly between the fifth and ninth centuries). <br/>

      Actually, the french you be speakin' is a much purer and older form of french than what is spoken today in France. Quebecois french has been preserved for almost 400 years, since the first french settlers landed on the St. Laurent. They've kept their language more or less the same, while the french of France has been twisted and changed after 400 years of war, migration, and evolution. So...you're french as shit, man. French shit. I just thought I'd mention it.

      Yeah, in general it really bothers actual french people. And vice-versa, if my teacher was any indication. One thing you also must understand: the colonists were laborers, not noblemen, and their accent was a bit coarse. Or rather, is a bit coarse. So yes, your comparison to a country hick is an accurate one. Although I've only ever spoken to a city raised frenchman about it, and I've heard that the more rural french hardly notice the accent.

      A Parisian friend of mine once compared the Quebecois dialect to that of a farmer from North Yorkshire rasping in the ear of a native Londoner.  You're right about the accent, but there are some interesting issues with the language itself as well.  Language, in its native habitat, evolves, right?  French has changed a great deal over the last few hundred years, especially in Paris, where many french nouns have actually been replaced by their english equivalents in common speech.  The result is that there are actually many french words that now exist exclusively in the Quebecois dialect, having fallen into disuse in France.

And the reason these languages don't evolve is because languages evolve due to war, trade, and the development of new technologies. So, since none of these things happen in isolated areas, language doesn't change. So that is one hell of an accurate statement, lawbot.

      Naw, but when someone of Low or Strange Mind makes some weird ass comment like it is just a basic day, it always seems to be you who's there to sort it out first.  <br/>

Check and see how many of your comments have an ellipsis in them that designates bewilderment, like, "Other... other way around, man," or "W...what?" which was used in reference to me getting "snrrg'd" and to the poster above who thought something you did was Burnsonian.   <br/>

      And I  <em>still</em>  don't know what "Burnsonian" is supposed to mean. I even Googled it. The only thing I can think of is that it somehow relates to Mr. Burns from The Simpsons, but I just don't think that's what was implied. <br/>

      Ok, it was a ridiculous comment on my part, and I feel sorry for causing so many work in vain. Still, the answer is that the "the two dudes? They are you and me." was very reminiscent of the style in which  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145045/https://www.websnark.com/">Eric Burns</a>  writes. And it made me chuckle <br/>

      I think if you italicized "out" then perhaps there would be an issue. The fairly new practice of turning nouns and adjectives into verbs makes an already confusing language even more obtuse. I admire your recognition of the idiom. I could not even begin to pronounce anything in Norwegian without pulling a muscle in my tongue.

      Whoops. I just didn't bother to check since buttermoths called you a man. I assumed he had checked. <br/>

Sorry from me too, dwodles! I think the reason I assumed you were a guy were that you were an Old Female when I checked. You'd be amazed how few of them are actually old females. <br/>

And dwodles avatar is still not animated...I'd do it myself, but my skills would sadly let the bills go unpaid.
