      Actually, it probably takes a lot less time to write "frequent Type 7 stool" than "patient describes pissing brown liquid out of his rectum for three to four minutes at a time whilst being compelled to sing various ad-libbed songs, in the manner of Negro Spirituals, regarding how his over-indulgence in tequila has resulted in the Almighty having completely given him over to the forces of faecal Hell."

      I know that it's Lynch and this can be pointlessly debated for a lifetime, but I've convinced myself that death (or at least Badness in general) was represented by the Man in the Planet. The Lady in the Radiator seemed like more of an angel. Or at worst that she represented a kind of peaceful death. Whatever she is, it's clear that she's in opposition to The Man in the Planet, and therefore cannot be too bad, as he is quite obviously a demonic being and  <em>blah blah blah blah</em> .

      Aye, she's a goodly being because death is what Henry wants, but I always saw the man in the planet as god, pulling the levers and observing and such.. At the end when things go all sparky and he finally joins the lady, I figured that to be him dying.  <br/>

      Could be that it isn't the first time.  Maybe Beef has seen it so many times he's de-sensitized, and he's saying things have changed in that since his stew-seeing cherry was already so popped, now he doesn't mind helping his friend out of the rough chuckles he's gotten himself into.

      Girls HATE it when you make fun of their Seconds.  My old roommate used to try to kind of sneak away to crap, and if I walked by the bathroom, I'd always go "DAAAAAMN that STINKS up ins!" or something similarly inane, but she took it very seriously and would get pissed off, every time, for 6 years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
She also hid all of her farts from me, except for one time: she walked into another room to fart, but I got up to go to the kitchen and walked right into the cloud, figured it out, and she weakly tried to deny it.

      I've been guilty of it once. It was a long time ago. If I'd known that it was going to happen every time the words "man ray" were mentioned, I wouldn't have bit. I guess I should have realized that it was bound to happen. It's pretty obvious.
