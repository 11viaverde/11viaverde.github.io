      I should've clarified this, yes, what i mean with 'the lawn is meant for the cars' is that usually the 'lawn' is basically a driveway, either paved or stoned into the lawn, which yeah, can look sorta bad. And it can only look ghetto by comparison, so we don't mind it much.

      Most lawns in the UK are paved over too to make more room. It's a shame since it's probably because the owners of the house have two cars, so they're polluting more and blocking rain drainage.

      I don't get the fork thing, I can't even visualize that.  Is it like picking food up with a fork and then switching hands with the food on the fork?  Why would someone do that?  It isn't tacky, it just doesn't make sense unless they have some sort of magnetic hook hand that can only magnetically hold the fork but can't pick food up very well, and the other arm is stumpy and has no elbow and can't reach their face, requiring this sort of process.

      here is how it happens: <br/> 
 <br/> 
A right handed man might hold a knife with his right hand and hold the fork with his left hand.  He would stab the steak with the fork to hold it in place, and do the cutting with the knife, using his right hand.  After cutting, he might then put the knife down, and move his fork to his right hand now that it is loaded and ready to eat on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i have often struggled with this in my dining experiences, and I do not know the proper way to go about this.

      In the U.S. it's common to hold the steak with your left hand on the fork, holding the meat steady, while you cut with your right (I assume this would be reversed for lefties), as the cut is complete you lay the knife down, and transfer the fork to your dominate hand to eat the meat from it. <br/> 
In other countries, you never lay down your knife, and you eat from the form with the same hand that steadied the meat for cutting.

      I am a righty, and I will be the first to admit that I am insufficiently coordinated to eat with my left hand.  If I were to cut with the knife in my left hand, I would lose a finger or fling food off the plate.  If I did not transfer the fork to the right hand after cutting, I would poke myself in the wrong orifice.  Sad, but true.  Well, true-ish.

      I sat through a shitty episode of x-files yesterday about this topic, but with a terrible x-files twist. This neighborhood had a human-sized monster that lived beneath the subdivision and if anyone put up any tacky outdoor decoration or had a burnt out light on their porch or didn't cut their lawn or something, the monster would just straight up murder them. <br/>
