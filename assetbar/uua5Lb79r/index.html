      Are there really restaurants out there like this? It's just so far removed from my normal dining experience (package of uncooked ramen   half empty bottle of beer while still in bed), it seems unreal. <br/>

That said, the food-oriented strips are some of my favorites.

      google 'fat duck' or 'heston blumenthal' (gah, spelling fail). they do exist, and the fat duck is reckoned to be the second best restaurant on the planet. it's just not for a dude who'd rather have galaxy nachos (i may be one of those dudes). :D

      I love Onstad as gastronome.  When I found out he was a foodie (forgive me) it only deepened my love of the strip.  Oh, and for more on the cutting edge of cooking, look  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101005104731/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Adri%C3%A0">here</a>  and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101005104731/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heston_Blumenthal">here</a>  and while its not  <em>exactly</em>  molecular gastronomy,   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101005104731/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Laundry">here</a> .

      For the last... hmmmm.... 8 years (god damn that makes me feel old) I have dedicated myself to convincing all our mutual friends that my best friend's middle name is Belulah. I ask them not to mention it to her because "she's sensitive about it." That way, people just go through life believing it, and it comes up at hilariously inopportune moments of her life. It reminded me of your Snake Nanny nomenclature.  <br/>

Also, I love Wodehouse, Douglas Adams and Anthony Bourdain. I wish I was back in Austin so we could be best friends.

      I think you can even throw a little Top Chef in there, too. For folks who don't follow that program, there's a semi-annoying little fellow named Marcel in Season 2 who was all about molecular gastronomy in general and foams in particular. "Manloc foam" sounds exactly like something he'd come up with.

      Actually, I'm pretty sure the "restuarant" Onstad is mocking is Thomas Keller's "French Laundry," because they literally do put at least half their "menu" in "quotation marks" for no apparent "reason", and also, French Laundry is in California, whereas Blumenthal is British. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, that reference to diners listening to the sounds of frying food as they eat fries is definitely a reference to Blumenthal, who has experimented with the sounds of eating and their psychological effects (ie, apples taste better if you can hear the crunch).

      It is the same in western Pennsylvania. I've heard of the foam food. I just can't rationalize paying money for the 'essence' of a meal that can be obtained for a fraction of the price. <br/> 
Food is sustenance. If you have the cash money to burn, which we all know Ray does, I guess the experience can be worth it? <br/> 
Beef is not of low mind. He just wants his sandwiches with double cheese and no foam.

I think there's a great amount of distance between us and what we eat these days. I don't want to sound like an unshaven, rustic, independent business promoter with the pamplet and everything, but it's nice sometimes to go to a butcher or a market where people actually used their hands to make the ingredients that you're going to use for your dinner. It's nice not to have something prepackaged or instant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Making it scientific and deconstructing it seems to just increase the distance. It's no longer chicken - it's Pou from the Gastronome Table of Elements. When someone rolls out the Willy Wonka television ray and beams Essence of Smoke Mussles into the back of your throat, you are not having a nice dinner, you are at the dentist or some such.

      I love food.  Love, love, LOVE it.  I love to taste new things, to experiment in the kitchen, to acquire new tools, and to prepare new dishes that make my family smile.  I've failed plenty of times (there's a reason the take-out joints are in the phone's memory) but I've succeeded, too.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I get a vast amount of satisfaction out of the sheer act of preparation, but I have to balance that with the reaction of the people consuming the final product.  The "molecular gastronomy" trend seems to me to be more about indulging the chef's whims and stroking the ego, rather than preparing dishes that the diners might actually want to eat.

Anyone like Achewood?  Well, I did and got my boyfriend totally hooked on it.  For Christmas I ordered a signed strip for him.  Its framed too.  This one: https://achewood.com/index.php?date=01262007. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Right after I ordered it, I found out he has been sleeping with some 23 year old whore waitress at his restaurant (he just got promoted from sous chef to head chef and it clearly went to both their heads). I feel sorry for her boyfriend too.  He seemed nice and cute. Don't know what she wanted with my sorry sack of a herpes ridden man-child. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can't return it because it is signed.  I don't want to give it to him anyway because he is a lying piece of shit and I want him and that skank to rot in hell. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I haven't even opened it so its all wrapped up and ready to go.  In time for Christmas?
