      If the patient's closest contacts are refusing to allow a treatment that the doctor believes could be either therapeutical or palliative, he can take legal action.  If he makes his case, the court will issue an order stating that the doctor's decision is for the benefit of the patient and he can do his treatment without the family's consent.  This whole process is surprisingly fast.

      Seriously. Lames are dear for everyone right now and people go around wasting the ones they have on just plain -mediocre- assets like the above? For shame, assetbarbies, for shame. Lames USED to be a powerful weapon against the fiendish machinations of villains such as Retardo and  Socicoto and Dr Manflesh sometimes Asherdan, but now we're just piddling away the ones we have left. Maybe it is good we are losing them. <br/>

      Holy shit! 127 dates before this strip is May 6 - between the last story in the Philippe arc (May 4) and the beginning of the Horror Van (May 9)arc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not unreasonable to infer that work on the first Van strip was started on May 6. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is Onstad telling us he ceased to give a fuck about his work on the day he started on the Van arc? <br/>

Cee-Lo's been called Cee-Lo Green (his real name's Thomas Callaway, by the way) since the Goodie Mob. It's almost certainly a reference to the game, which was originally Chinese. And also it sounds damn cool.  <br/>

Cee-Lo Green is an incredibly talented singer, rapper, and songwriter. Shut the hell up.

Mainly I am trying to say that this guy's performance in this video sucked balls, and I'm trying to express why this is, for me.  I don't care if you don't agree, because it's not required that you agree with me.  You say he's established.  Well whoop de fucking la de la dee laa dee doo!  Fucking Sarah Palin is established too, and she's a fucking Sony robot prototype that escaped from the lab.  What the fuck does being established have to do with the fact that I thought the video sucked.

      I think you get yourself into a logical pitfall when you attempt to compare %u201Cnegro culture%u201D to %u201Cwhite American culture,%u201D perhaps because the concept of identities is so vague.  %u201CNegro culture%u201D could theoretically encompass the breadth of all African cultures, and attempting to make any comparison between that and %u201Cwhite American culture%u201D is an apples/oranges situation.  I will have to assume you mean %u201Cblack American culture.%u201D <br/> 
Does %u201Cwhite American culture%u201D have chauvinism than %u201Cblack American culture?%u201D  I don%u2019t believe so.  Historically, white American males have been the most privileged people on Earth, given the vast resources and agency afforded to them.  They did little to promote the welfare of any other demographic, finding any rationalization to hold on to their privilege.  Conversely, figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois gained political traction by urging integration and assimilation.  When the white American male refused to offer suffrage, there was a firm belief within the %u201Cblack American culture%u201D that volunteering for military service would earn equal legal rights.  This seems to run against the thesis you propose. <br/> 
We%u2019ve been operating in generalities so far, and I%u2019m not sure that%u2019s appropriate.  You say the Cee-Lo Green is an exemplar of a chauvinistic culture.  I think Cee-Lo Green, as emphasized by the use of the stage name, is a character.  There wouldn%u2019t seem to be much of a market for a mild-mannered and meek performer.  My experience with musicians, athletes, and actors of various backgrounds leads me to believe performers need to project a certain bravado in order to be successful.  To say that the song is overly concerned with superficiality, well, it%u2019s pop music.  It isn%u2019t intended to pierce the soul, or provide meaningful political commentary.  It%u2019s there to connect with you on a brief, fleeting, emotion level.  That%u2019s why you hear pop music at sporting events and rallies.  It connects to something that we%u2019ve all experienced, and deals with it neatly and conveniently in 2 to 5 minutes. <br/> 
I%u2019m tired and only awake because I%u2019m too drunk to lay down.  I%u2019ll wrap it up.  Even if Cee-Lo Green is a stage name, why the fuck bring it up?  That%u2019s the most base form of schoolyard bullying ever.  Those %u201Cghetto blacks%u201D had zero say in being named something that seems absurd to you.  They could change it once they%u2019re old enough, sure, but maybe being ashamed of your past isn%u2019t the healthiest way to play it.  For someone ranting about people hung up on the surface of things, you don%u2019t seem to have any desire to look into anything deeper than your own point of view.

      I'm going to go ahead and mark my own diatribe as spam.  I was really frustrated with what I perceived to be yoboyobo_ni's ignorance, and rather than being reasonable and ignoring it, I decided to engage in Internet Argument.  I don't think I'm an appropriate person, and this isn't an appropriate place, to tackle some of the beliefs that yoboyobo_ni has.

      Your entire argument hinges on the idea that a single language is a reflection of *one* culture, or that a single dialect is a reflection of *one* culture, rather than a series of cultures, thoughts, inside jokes, beliefs and ideas that all coalesce into something more permanent and communicable.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Those names are what people *believe* to be African, and they give them so that they feel African, or maybe they just sound cool. In any case, they feel more connected to their chosen culture, which you have no right to define as right or wrong.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
No one has to kill anyone in order for culture to "evolve"--they just have to not be people like you, apparently; culture has evolved for years and will continue to do so whether you continue to post long-winded, pretentious, backhandedly-racist comments on Assetbar or not.

      So I was at the bathroom at work today, and I was standing there at the urinal, holding my penis, and I heard a gentleman (I presume it was a man, since it was in the male's bathroom) cough in the pooping stall nearby.  It was a short cough.  I was immediately struck by the fact that I could discern beyond reasonable doubt the race of the cougher.  He was balck!  How weird is that.  Balck people not only talk funny, they even cough funny!  I immediately decided that I should tell this to the the internet to see what they have to say.  Oh what say you internet people?

      okay first of all obviously not all balck people will have a ebonic cough.  for instance you could have identical twin balck people what was separated at birth and they was both adopted by caucasian or asian or whatever non-balck race families.  So possibly at least one of the twins would develop a caucasian cough instead of a balck ebonic cough.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean for fucks sakes think about it for a second you know how sometimes you are on the phone talking to a 'white' person and it turns out to be a balck person cleverly disguising his voice, perhaps even deceptively jewishly disguising his voice as if he is white?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>A balck jew making me think he's white?  On my phone calls?!?!?</em> <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">is more likely than what you thinks, nigga!</span> <br/> 
 <br/> 
So in conclusion I never said ALL BALCK PEOPLES!  I never said that.  If you read it that way, well then I'm sorry that you're subliminally subconsciously a racist bag of douche detritus, all with chunky after-birth type of bloody clotted uterus lining type of stuff.  I'm sorry that this is undeniably what is the primary composition of your brain mass, but if you post your pay-pal-registered e-mail account on assetbar here, along with what caliber of gun you own, I will be friendly enough to wire you some money so you can buy a hollow-point bullet to help clean the placenta out between your ears.

      I agree with this because you can't disagree with it.  It's not "wrong" that African-Americans adopted some kind of different culture 30, 40 years ago--it just is what happened.  That's how languages and cultures work.

      Can I say something? Hegemonic culture breeds resistance. I've had it up to here with Walmart and cable TV. I'm a resoration carpenter and I play a cowbell in the streets of New Orleans. Lucky me. Other people evidence their rejection by naming their kids unpronouncible symbols and reading Achewood. The rejection at it's best is the creation of new paradigms, at it's worst it is pointless contrarianism which is then co-opted by the hegemonic culure. Cee-lo is no more than a nickname and as such it affords a modicum of individuality. If you see it as no more than that, it should not trouble you. The song itself is best just listened to, or watched in it's earlier version with just the lyrics presented graphicly. Is there anyone out there who has not lost a girl to a man with larger resources? The song captures those sentiments in a tough yet cheerful lyric. If there is anything I to object to in the video it is the awkward narrative and the fact that Cee-Lo is well over 300 lbs, which may shorten his life

      No it isn't. The premise of the song is that a large number of potential listeners have lost a lover to someone the attraction of whom they find questionable. The resentment for that person (fuck you), spreads to the ex-lover (fuck her too).

      I have not lost a girl to a man with larger resources. I have lost a girl to a girl with larger resources (i.e. breasts) (i.e. any) (i.e. I am a man). Perhaps this predicament is not universal enough for Cee-Lo's consideration? Surely in this enlightened age it is becoming more common.

      Well, Steve called Teodor at 6:00 AM to tell him Philippe would be inbound in 17 to 23 hours, and Pete showed up to abduct him at 1:53 AM, ostensibly right in the middle of that time window. Of course we have no proof that this was actually the following day, but the next time we saw Philippe, he was typing extraordinarily early and had already gone in to look for Teodor, which are both things  <em>I</em>  would do if I was a preschooler delivered home before dawn.

      I have a reasoned argument against Phillipe being up because he's still awake from an early arrival.  Mr. Bear's greeting did not reference at all "Hey little guy you're back" or "Shouldn't you go to bed after such a long trip" or anything like that.  It was "hey you're up early" - which implies the little guy was sleeping, not just up from arriving from a trip.  Next, "you know how poorly he's been sleeping" may imply he's been there to lately to come to the knowledge. Now, "already gone for the day" - if he arrived predawn, who greeted him, and answered the door - Mr. Bear, or Teodor?  In the case Teodor greeted him, it was either a different night, or Phillipe arrived prior to 2AM - too early for him to have not gone to bed for the night.  In the case Mr. Bear answered the door/greeted him, the "you're up early" comment and Phillipe's response wouldn't be appropriate if Phillipe was already up from arriving, because they would have already greeted each other on the day.

      he already did.  but, i mean, if some weird ass wanted to get on and pretend to be aiu, that's the easy way to mimic it.   <br/>

That means I think it is average to have an incredibly detailed story about a guy throwing thousands of pennies at some girl he stalked then trapped with his car while masturbating furiously. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have been exposed to so much that I'm losing decency.

      if decency is a facade we use to cover up and bury our head in the sand from the true sexual urges that pulse through our veins from time to time (or in some people's cases 24x7x365.25) then I say it's a good thing to lose decency. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A story about a serial killer who skins his victims and makes a lampshade out of them is all sensational and horrific, but I say props to the serial killer, because he's exhibiting a hell of a lot more dedication and creativity than someone who merely shoots his gf out of a fit of rage or whatever.  There is so much violence in our society, both lethal and non-lethal, not least of which is Sarah Palin killin' mooses) that I think it behooves us to explore the topic often and frequently. <br/>

      maybe I will discuss this with my counselor.  maybe.  at the end of my last visit, she touched me on the arm, kind of seemed like it might be suggestive... but she's married... with a kid no less... so I'm sure she's not wanting to pork me... she's just.. so happy and gay that she likes to touch people on the arm, all friendly like.. don't women understand what this does to men?  Shouldn't a therapist, of all people, have this insight into the male psyche?  I had a chubby all the way home.  That's not so much a function of psyche as of not having been laid in the last 6 or so years, except that one time with that girl from the free internet dating site.  And that doesn't even fully count;  she was more chubby than I imagined her from her picture.

      Some of the best sex I have ever had was with a chubby chick, who had had 3 kids. She was totally happy with who she was and I think that makes all the difference. <br/>

Plus, of course, she had shelves of sex books and a drawer filled with funny toys. And she was a squirter (which almost made me buy a house with her). <br/>

Nothing compared to regrets held over the sex I passed over due to having a conscience though.  I often wish I had had that sex.  It's probably living larger in my mind due to being 'forbidden' or something, but by God what you can't (let yourself) have is somehow the most exciting prospect imaginable.  Gah.

      You know, it is. I mean, let's assume that we're dealing with some poor Russian woman with a glandular problem who doesn't get anything remotely nutritious in her diet. She's crouched over a tarp in a little hut that some washed-up photographer uses over and over, because all the money he makes from these things goes to buying more shitty adulterated heroin from the local mob. This is the last burst of any creativity that either of them are capable of accomplishing. <br/>

      I've had thrush in the past. I know, as Vlad has told us, that it is mainly a thing of chicks, but I totally got thrush. Apparently it's also more a thing of uncut dudes, so the Jews are ahead of us on this one, as in so much else. I told the girl who I believe gave it to me (via oral) what had happened and she got incredibly defensive and rude and basically accused me of cheating on her, so that relationship never really recovered.  <br/> 
The thrush, on the other hand, cleared up quite quickly. I recommend clotrimazole, unperfumed talcum powder and not wearing underwear in bed.

      Yeah.  Yeast aren't bacteria though, and while a lady garden might easily grow yeast, a man pole does not.  Therefore, for yeast to move from a lady venue to a man venue require that yeast to be going crazy in the lady.  It's like when lots of punks aren't going to show up in a late night diner unless there's a great punk concert going on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, the mouth of an otherwise healthy adult is unlikely to bear the strange fruit unless that adult has been taking antibiotics, because bacteria and yeast compete for space.  You said vaginas are much more sterile than mouths, and this is true, but it's also WHY vaginas get candidal infections so much easier than mouths. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, if your innate immune response has been compromised or you have especially sugary moist spots (as in diabetes) you are much more likely to get yeast infections, both on your mouth and vagina.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
In short, FUCK YOU SCORPIO_NADIR.   I HATE THIS VAGINAL SUPPOSITORY.

      The worst thing about mad cow disease is that we might have so many deaths twenty or thirty years down the line from failing to take precautions in the nineties and early 2000s.  The people who have already died might just be the tip of the iceberg, because prions seem to be capable of incubating and slowly dividing for decades.

      I didn't swagger in and shout 'You gave me knob-rot you filthy whorish bitch'. I raised a possible shared health problem which is exactly the sort of thing you should do with your partners if you are not a massive wanker. As thegoblins so rightly points out, if a man gets thrush and hasn't caught if from oral or vaginal contact that is a pretty major indicator for diabetes or a compromised immune system so yes, I did mention it to her. If you think that chivalry is about ignoring major health problems, grinding your raw diseased nether regions together in stony, wincing silence until you expire from complications, if that is your idea of suavity then I suppose yes I am an innocent in the world of dating.

Having faced somewhat similar circumstances myself I made the suggestion that I had been the vector for the shared interest. It is desirable, (me thinks) to discuss these sorts of matters in a non accusatory fashion. <br/>

      It sounds to me like the woman was being unreasonable and ignorant about the matter.  A yeast infection is usually NOT a sexually transmitted disease in women, and it ALWAYS is in men.  So basically, she was like, "Yeast?  In my vagina?  FUCK YOU HATSTAND!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
The American public takes a very narrow, uninformed view of any sort of sexual dysfunction or infection, because we aren't encouraged to be open and communicative about these things.  We creep around feeling guilty and ashamed about our nethers.

      Ah, hell.  My girlfriend and I got a yeast thing going on when we were 17 (TWENTY-TWO YEARS AGO, DEAR HEAVENLY GOD - thegoblins might actually be the child of our loving yeast community).  We had no idea what was going on and just freaked the hell out.  I went to the family doctor, who diagnosed me with "chlamydia" without even testing me and put us both on the requisite medication.  We didn't say anything to each other at the time, since we were both virgins before getting pretty heavily into it with each other, but each of us thought the other had been sleeping around as a result - pretty hard to get chlamydia by sleeping with a virgin, right?  Awhile later, another doctor tells me it's a bloody yeast infection - candida.  Meanwhile, a pretty sweet, innocent, horny little relationship is completely fucked up by presumptuous GP's rash assumption (pun intended).  Man, FUCK that guy.

As long as we're not being communicative about these things, remember that he suspected oral transmission. Which is rather particular and makes me wonder if the lady in question is one of those people that don't consider oral sex to be sex. I dated a young lady that, for reasons of religion, would not have vaginal sex, but oral sex, bondage and general kinkiness were just fine with her God. Tested my atheism somewhat she did. Let me put it to the assetbarbarians, is oral <br/> 
pleasure sex, or something different? Please discuss in your usual restrained fashion.

Seriously, they prefer to develop products, including vaccines, HPV for example, for which a market exists or can be developed in wealthy countries. <br/> 
They would like malaria vaccine research to be funded by governments or charities as the market is largely in poorer countries where large profits are more difficult to make. <br/>

The book is a primer on the scientific method, e.g., that is to say, on rational thought it's self.  It's a wonderful book.  If anything can make a person see daylight, perhaps this book is it.

      As far as we know HPV has no serious adverse effect on males. The only reason to vaccinate males is to protect their (female) partners against cervical cancer. Vaccinated HPV naive females are 99-100% seropositive after 5 years, so if you vaccinate females there is no known community health reason to vaccinate males. <br/> 
Vaccination probably costs $300-$400 per person (in Oz). If an individual is happy to spend that so he won't get 'warts in his cock', that's up to him, but I think a society could use the funds more wisely.

      too easy to forge.  they would have to implant a microchip similar to the serial chip they put in pets and there would be an iphone app that could scan the chip, look you up in the database, and reveal if you really has the vaccine or not.  Of course then you might get people digging up dead bodies in graveyards for their HPV chip, all scanning through the rotted flesh with their iphone... it's over here, I found one I found one!

      I've been playing the monogamy game for just shy of 7 years at this point, and we're both the first ones the other has porked, so it is not much of a practical concern. <br/> 
I had a really close friend who had to have a series of Big Scary Procedures after some HPV messed up her Big Scary Insides.  She took it as well as you can, I suppose, but if I can remove the possibility of doing that to someone, at the cost of a handful of vidyagames, sign me up. <br/>

Yeah, the girls-who-blow-dudes is to be considered, though I have a feeling most papers dismiss it, since they fall into the existing HPV vaccine market.

      Wow, something similar. Except it kept happening. And really sucked. My now-wife, fiance at the time, suggested athlete's foot cream (can't remember the brand) and it basically petrified my foreskin. Like trying to squeeze your fist through a straw. My first real look at the thing after it turned to stone was in a bathroom stall; it was like that moment in Eraserhead where the guy goes, "wow, you are sick" and there's this jarring shot of the now mottled/revolting baby groaning, "BLEEEAAARGH...."

      Gosh, sorry, I got a little overdramatic there. We aren't talking insipidous tissue necrosis here, it isn't like it fell off or anything. It got really, really dry, lost all elasticity and looked more disgusting than usual, but this was over 2 years ago and my dork has since made a full recovery. It was worse than chapped skin though; it was more like, like cracked looking. <br/>

No pix, but I'll tell you what : buy a variety of antifungal salves, and smear them all over the tip of your penis. When the skin begins to remind you of a very old man's elbow, bingo. "Discontinue use".

      Easy, dude - which we both know you are - until just now, no one even mentioned YOUR penis - one of which we now both know you have. <br/> 
The facts. Would a woman ask for the phone numbers of head-happy women? Maybe. You have the face of a cat, I see. Prejudicially speaking, this is unpopular with women. High school art shows and ebay auctions may have you believe otherwise, however consider that cats are relaxed blobs of colour and therefore easy to draw, hence their popularity in art class. Given boundless talent we'd see a lot more orangutans in amateur art shows, or Transformers, as we do on message boards, since these images are freely available and ready to wear. Bullshit? Fine. With overuse, the phrase, "even if I did", always means "I do". Even if it didn't (see?), I never mentioned your dork - you did - which affirms your masculinity. <br/> 
You're a dude, you have a dork, you haven't fed it to anyone, or anything but your fist in a while and no one, I mean no one, wants to see it.  <br/> 
Except me, now. C'mon, show it to me.

I haven't pored over every post here in a couple days, but has nobody picked up on (what I see as) the really clear message that the readers are the one's being told to fuck off? I feel like I'm 7 again and Dad hasn't been home in 2 weeks cuz he isn't even trying to hide his infidelity anymore. He finally comes home one night with gifts for everybody but they are clearly from the bar near his sancha's house, and I am the only child not delighted.

      Burned by fineoakstructure.  I'm not going to pretend it doesn't hurt, but it is nice to be noticed by one of the heavy hitters.  Wait, that doesn't sound very Assetbar, so I guess I meant, "shut up, jerkface!  You don't know everything!  Maybe you should be called fineoakjerkfacestructureofmean".  <br/>

      Oh, no burn intended.  That Lyle artwork always stand out in my head, because it was well into Achewood (2006), and, for some reason, Lyle looks really odd in it; I mean, Onstad had pretty much had the models figured out by then, but that really doesn't look like regular Lyle much at all. <br/>

And I'm no heavy hitter.  I think you need at least 3000 chubbies for that.

      127, which Onstad keeps going back to, is the unique loopback I.D. of TCP/IP. It is the original identity in binary land of every machine that accesses internet, the cyber-id, so to speak.  <br/> 
Maybe saying with tongue-in-cheek that identity is hard-coded, yet originally a serendipitous accident. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad is rockin' some mind-blowing nerd psychology if that choice is intentional, or his subconscious is even more rockin'....either way, it's mind-blowing nerd symbolo-psychology.

Which brings me to my next point: We know Onstad has insight into the depressed mind from his writing of Beef. What if he's suffering from depression, which makes him not want to work so hard, and then everyone's come along and rubbished him for it?

      I started reading this comic a couple of years ago, I think when I stumbled across the 'Ray gets sort of stoned' arc. Then I went back to the beginning and read through them all. It took me about a couple of years, maybe 1 1/2 or so. So I just caught up to current times within the past couple of weeks, and I got to say: <br/> 
1)Nice Pete really turned out to be kind of a dick. <br/> 
2)It's funny being in a situation where I have to wait for an arc to play out instead of just being able to read it all at once, and to see how Onstad can jump from a Batmanesque situation with certain doom for one of the main characters to some random distractions to draw out the suspense, like a true bastard <br/> 
3)I never thought I would catch up with it being a strip of Teodor blowing a 10 inch kitty meat.

      Last weekend, I observed my neighbor unsuccessfully attempting to start his mower.  After 30 frustrating minutes, he stood up, kicked it, and uttered this bon mot: <br/> 
"FUCK THE FUCKIN' FUCKER!  THE FUCKIN' FUCKER'S FUCKED!"

      Ever the researcher, I was curious as to the originality of his epithet, so I hied me to Google and discovered that it possibly originated with a British military truck driver during World War II complaining about his inoperable conveyance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The next time I encountered my neighbor, I inquired as to whether he was cognizant of the provenance of his remark, to which he replied: <br/> 
"THE NEXT TIME YOU COME PONCING OVER HERE WITH YOUR FANCY WORDS, I'LL KNOCK YOUR TEETH SO FAR DOWN YOUR THROAT YOU'LL HAVE TO STICK YOUR TOOTHBRUSH UP YOUR ASS TO CLEAN 'EM!"

I'm not going to pretend that I'm not frustrated by the huge delays, but yeah, this webcomic has been a companion of mine for a few years now: I can relate to the characters, I've laughed tons, learnt some...so yeah, I guess we all gotta stick out the times with Chris, he deserves it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or, if you had the Roman Empire, you've gotta take the Dark Ages afterwards, if you want to get  <em>historical</em>

      Hooray for everyone who can breathe again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hooray for nicotine patches, in my case. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My lungs are now making me hyperventilate when breathing normally, since they can now extract a normalish amount of oxygen from each inhalation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The 'Let's smoke ...  <strong><em><span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">FOREVER</span></em></strong> ' strip affected me quite a lot.

      Speaking about the financial "crisis", I would like to take this interlude to educate all of you on why the United States has suffered booms and busts, with all the attendant horrifying results to the citizenry, throughout its history.  Three words: Fractional Reserve Banking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Believe it or not, the crime those three words stand for has done more devastation to humanity in the last 600 years or so than all other forms of pestilence combined.  Does anyone doubt that?
