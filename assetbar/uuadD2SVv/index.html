      A Frenchman, an Italian and a Polack are discussing the purpose of the head at the end of the penis.  The Frenchman says, "It exists to give the woman a more pleasurable experience."  The Italian says "You are incorrect, it exists to enhance the man's pleasure."  The Polack says, "You are both wrong, it is there to keep your hand from slipping off."

      The only one I can remember now is the Polack that is in a bar and the bartender offers to tell him a Polack joke.  The guy gets all mad and says, "I'll have you know that I'm Polish," and the bartender says, "That's okay, I'll tell it slow." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember hearing more when I was a little kid but I think they were all like dumb little kid jokes, like "Why did the Polack throw the clock out of the window?  Because he wanted to see time fly."  Stuff like that.  They were all about how Polish people are stupid.  I don't really understand were it comes from. <br/> 
The last panel in this strip made me laugh really hard.

      Polish suddenly becomes very easy to pronounce once you recognize that most of those commonly occurring 2- or 3-consonant clusters are simple phonemes(?) - that is, don't go trying to pronounce each individual letter. For example, the aforementioned "rz" makes sort of a z or a j sound... kinda like the French word "je." Furthermore, the y's are always pronounced as short i's are in English (as in fish, wit, lip). Add that to the fact that unlike English, the vowels are always pronounced the same way, and stress nearly always falls on the second-to-last syllable, and Polish is a fairly sensible and consistent language to pronounce. <br/>

      "I don't really understand were it comes from." <br/> 
I believe it originated in the 40's when the polish rode horses into several battles in world war 2. In many cases against armored/tank divisions. But that was kind of like a roast beef thing is a fact, but sad, and which sucks to say. <br/>

Anyway, that could explain all the war related ones, like this <br/>

      You're half right, in the sense that this is when the jokes began to be commonly identified with Polish people, but all of the basic jokes were derived from a common Eastern European stock where each population would make fun of neighboring ones. I'm Russian and a lot of jokes that we have about the Chucki are the same as Polish jokes.

      You're right that many xenophobic cultural groups tell these "stupid" jokes about their neighbors.  It reveals a weakness in all of us to be "better" than others, knowing we are just the same if not stupider in reality. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My favorite theory about why the Poles got so lambasted with these shitty jokes has to do with the number of concentration camps that were set up in Poland, and the huge number of Polish Jews that were killed, thus angering the next generation of Jewish joke writers who manufactured millions of these jokes in revenge.
