      Asherdan is often upset that other posters have not made effective use of the considerable time between his assetbar visits to come up with replies more well-thought out. <br/>

      Yeah. The system is totally broken. Particularly telling is that a comment posted by the AssetBar administrative account has been marked as spam. <br/>

      From my understanding successful message board forums have a appointed responsible members with various levels of power. Limiting the "spam" exclusion power to a few active members would greatly reduce or eliminate this problem. Furthermore a 'temp block' and 'IP Ban' options would be given to other levels of admins. Just a thought.

      Now Onstad has unknowingly committed himself to making a blanket as well. I hope that it will be made of the same crappy fabric that the children's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle blankies were made of.

      they're for spam posts - you know, by bots or adwizards. <br/>

but i guess the same knuckleheads are going to ruin things so when this thing actually DOES attract spam bots, stuff will be useless.

      i mean, this is supposed to be a forum for talking about the strip, but i figure i'll add my two cents about this whole 'spam' business as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
out of curiosity, i checked out one of the spam posts, completely at random. <br/> 
 <br/> 
all the post was was a guy typing in the alt text. <br/> 
 <br/> 
how is that spam?  i immediately suspect foul play.
