      I'm bipolar, and you're right; there is a  <em>major</em>  difference.  I've tried to find a better word for the sad feeling a cheerleader gets when the quarterback cheats on her with that defensive lineman with the cute cleats, but it's a tough row. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For me, anyway, depression isn't feeling sad.  It's just not  <em>feeling</em> .  When you don't  <em>feel</em>  anything,  <em>doing</em>  anything is almost impossible. <br/>

Also, the laming of your post was clearly done by assholes. <br/>

      Well, it's a lot more complicated than that, I'm afraid.  We battle all diseases, don't we?  They always say that about people with cancer, for instance, that they fought it.  We stuggle with our conditions, sometimes winning, sometimes losing.  I now understand it so much better, recognize the early symptoms, have found some chemical relief, and most of all, learned to love myself as I am.

      So I had commented in an unspectacular manner a while back because this strip resonated with me.  I come back to it later and see that there's this whole discussion about disease that I totally missed the first time 'round. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Reading pogo's posts makes me feel kind of happy.  I'm not depressed, per se, but I have a fairly severe case of social anxiety which occasionally drags a bout of depression along with it (you get moody if you realize you're terrified of going to the grocery store because PEOPLE are there).  My friends--I love them with all my heart--don't have any social anxiety, and therefore have trouble understanding.  Regularly I get comments to "suck it up," or "I was shy too once, I learned to break free."  Reading comments from people who understand how it all works is a bit refreshing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm currently trying to find a good psychiatrist near my new apartment that I can dump my health insurance money into.  But this is hard because it involves setting up appointments with people I don't know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cheers, though.  To everybody.

      i just recently found out that one of my friends has social anxiety. yesterday we were in a store and i guess he wasn't following me so we kinda got separated until i stepped outside and found him sitting on a bench all, "you left me." <br/> 
 <br/> 
i felt bad. i knew he had this problem but i thought he saw where i went. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i do not know where i was going with this. i guess just to say that i understand. also that i am pretty glad i don't have to deal with it personally.

      A chubby for a fellow soldier in the social anxiety battle. Medicine has helped me so much, it's incomprehensible. But once you lose the anxiety, it kind of changes who you used to be, and that will be alarming to some people. Be prepared for this if you choose this route.

      I have social anxiety, too. I know what it's like trying to get shit done so you can talk with someone about it, it's tough, but it's so worth it once you finally get it done. Cognitive therapy is just as important as medication, if not more so. I wish I had some tips or something but I'm just as stuck as you are.

      i use chemicals to treat my chronic depression, as well.  ive come to the realization that its a very self-centering condition.  and on top of that, its irrational.  you know, in your head, that everything is important.  you know that it doesnt matter how awesome you are, you really need to take a shower and change your clothes.  you know that just because your long-distance friend didnt call you on your birthday doesnt mean that youre a decroded piece of crap.  you know all this stuff, but you cant act on it.  you dont care.  youre too lame for any of your efforts to come to fruition. <br/> <br/> it causes one to be fixated on ones own self(insecurities, etc...), rather than others.  and i dont want to discount healthy pride and self-esteem, but looking outside ones self for contentment is quite important.  go volunteer at the hospital and fluff pillows for the terminally-ill children(or whatever, but you know what i mean...).  then youll see that you dont have as much of a suckfest. <br/> <br/> also, i think that those of us with spiritual leanings have an advantage(that whole perpetual hope and eternal perspective thing...). <br/> <br/> somethign else just occurred to me: a critter, specifically, a dog.  who isnt a dog  always happy to see?  a good way to battle 'the blues' is a co-dependant pet.

      I think it's just that those of us who aren't clinically depressed or bipolar can't really understand it. My friend and roommate is depressed/bipolar and while I try to be sympathetic and understanding, there's only a certain point that I can get to, since when I get bummed out I can have a few beers or listen to some rockin' tunes and feel better. Or, alternatively, have a few beers and listen to Tom Waits and then wake up okay the next morning. So when my roommate says that she's depressed, I have a hard time not thinking "well...maybe try not taking shit so seriously" even though I know from a logical/factual perspective that it's nothing like that at all.

      This chubby means I understand completely. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One time I got in a mood, drove out to the store at midnight listening to Bone Machine, bought some steaks and ate them raw. I can't remember if I had the alcohols at the same time but after a certain point booze starts to seem redundant. I suppose the fact I was able to get to the store and buy things implies that it wasn't depression of the Roast Beef sort, but it was some kind of fucked up and I'm glad I don't feel that way now.

      This is true. To say one has depression is to implicitly cede that it is entirely beyond one's control. While a lot of people do have the mental illness brand of depression where there's very little they or anyone else can do about it at times, I think you're right about the aggregate.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
A good number of those who would say they "got" depression are the ones who do not have any sort of uncontrollable depression but who are choosing to cede their responsibility for their own countenance to some other quasi-godly source, or the fickle hand of fate. I should know. I sort of did that, in weaker years. It was not my finest hour. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway. I really like finding these sorts of comments in the archives on this run-through. They make reading Assetbar all the more worth it, even if they get a bit humdrum now and again. Thanks, Pogo.

      Dear Mr. Pogo, <br/> 
I don't think being serious was out of place; I spend a lot of my life fighting off depression. I more or less keep it at bay, until a the days come when I can't say "I love you" because of how much it hurts. <br/> 
You're my favorite Assetbar poster; I hope I'm not being presumptuous when I say that I think you're a kindred spirit.  <br/>

      Whereas he annoys me due to his ridiculous hypocrisy and double-standards... and yet I haven't lamed a single thing he has said here. Why? Who knows. Maybe because I'm a bitter, viciously pessimistic sod who views depression as inevitable and life as it ought not be. <br/> 
I guess thus far I just chose to stay out of this communal whine-fest instead.  <br/>

      anhedonia is a lot more than just being sad and is sometimes difficult to understand for those who are sometimes down but consistently working towards their own happiness. <br/> 
feels like... you know what sort of things you want to do, what could make you happy, but you have absolutely no motivation to pursue these ends. an overwhelming hopelessness... beef would very much like to go to the store, but just can't bring himself to do something that could make him happy because, in the end, what's the point really? <br/>

also this was my first strip; i think my brother thought i was amusingly beef-like. <br/>

      I think the fact that Roast Beef "has" depression is actually a way of saying it is a disease that sticks with him. It's been something he's dealt with all his life, and it has kinda become part of him. Very deterministic, especially if he was real, but he isn't and I think that makes it ok, if fairly sad.

The sign probably looks like that, it's just that when you've got depression, that's the part that stands out to you. It embodies the horribleness of the sign and the store and everything about the whole affair. Wordlessly, Onstad perfectly conveys the whole concept of not being able to go places because of depression.

to rate it based on Beef's actual mood in the strip, since the little ratings buttons are his face.  In that case, this strip would be a -3.

      I'm gonna go off on my own and admit that depression has never effected me to this extent. Now, I used to get crazily depressed, and all, but not to the point of actually hightailin' it outta there like that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This does, however, pretty amazingly sum up my experience with bad acid trips. I mean, it's just identical to this. You just see the filth and the rot on every little thing you encounter and you just gotta go.  <br/>

I don't do acid anymore. And I don't get too depressed anymore now that I've figured out that nothing can possibly matter, ever.   <br/>
