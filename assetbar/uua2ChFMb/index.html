      I'm thinking the other side of this.  Let's get some boob-colored tacos.  I would eat these.  I would pay double, just to have more boob colored food.  Though if Subway ever got into it, I'd feel awkward getting turned on by the color of a footlong. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another care: If women were Mrs. Potato Heads, I would put a second mouth on them.  So the conversation wouldn't lag when were, uh, being intimate.  I would link the strip of Teodor helping Ray cheer up, but I am a lazy man, with lazy lazy hands.

      I'm not sure if people were offended by your example of women talking about boring things, or if they lamed you because it has been heard before. I for one understand where you're coming from. If my wife is able to compose words, even if it is between gasps and moans, she will continue talking about rude co-workers while I am boffing her. On the upshot this has motivated me to learn better moves.

      Here in North Carolina, Jack in the Box vanished for a few years because some lady died from bad meat. <br/>

      I recall a road trip I took with my little brother, niether of us 'accustomed' to fast food, still found it necessary to stop at a Burger King for a meal. We both bought a Whooper, and we both got the 'pimp skitters'.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the road back, we stop at the same BK, as it was the last restaurant before the overpass, and I had explained to him that to make good time, a sit down establishment was out of the question. As luck would have it, little brother uses the facilities and leaves me to order. I order him a Triple Whopper with Cheese, and ask that they 'put some stink on it'. Months later now, he still curses my name.

      I thought, apparently wrongly, of the insides of the tacos.  I have seen breasts that are vaguely carne asade colored.  Nice.  I have seen breasts that are carnitas-colored.  Also nice.

      See I was wondering why they would appeal to Beef, a known Breast man%u2122. Real Breast Men%u2122 are into hangin naturals on their ladies. Sure, looking at a silicone filled domes is okay on paper, but that shit don't move right. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Any other card carrying Breast Men%u2122 care to chime in on this?

      I love how all the percentages add to 122.3, though that figure's probably closer to 112.1 since I'm assuming most of the people who suffered "demise, person" were also victims of "delusion and self-evisceration", a quite terrible fate indeed. Besides being a seemingly random percentage, it also means that either a) everyone with breast implants is very unhappy/dead or b) about half of people with implants have multiple afflictions <br/>

      I'm also willing to accept the idea that a woman can be hysterical without taco-colored breasts. However, the idea that a woman could have taco-colored breasts amd NOT delve into hysterics is harder for me to swallow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another way of looking at it could be that not only do 100% of women who undergo breast surgery exhibit at least one of these traits, there's about 12% of women who have not who experience one anyway. <br/>

But what do I know about women? I'm from The Internet.

      This looks like a job for Joke Ruiner! Here I come! <br/> 
Each percentage is calculating a separate factor, so it does not really matter what their sum is.  In the realm of pure probability, you test for each affliction separately. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For example, you roll for capsular contraction, then infection, and onward to Death, Person.  So there is a chance in this example of staying complication free.  To find it, we begin with our odds of avoiding Capsular Contraction, 72%.  Our chance of missing that AND Infection would be 86.1% of 72%, or 61.992%.  Keep calculating down this list to find the actual odds of problem free fake titties, which I can't be fucked to calculate at the moment, and are still fairly low.

I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's when a booby feels a great deal like that sponge sitting on the edge of your kitchen sink that has that unpleasant plumpness you  <em>know</em>  is a result of being stuffed with bacteria and grease.

      Implants are the toupee of the 21st Century.  Increasingly a relic of outmoded standards of beauty.  As a bald dude, I am glad that I am getting old now and not 20 years ago, since standards of male looks can include baldness.  Same thing with the knockers.  The key is simply to dress well.

      also i think there is very little material on the internet that is capable of restoring faith in men. at least i haven't seen any. but don't fret, loneal. guys may talk but when it comes down to it, i think most of them know fake ones ain't as much fun.

      Yes, natural is way better, not only do large fake boobs look silly, it hurts when they hit you.  I went to the nudie bar with some friends on my birthday last year, and when I got an ambush lap dance (trying to get another strippers attention during $1 mini-dance time when the stripper with the large fake boobs snuck up on me), it felt as if I was being repeatedly punched in the face.

      You are correct in that assumption. They had to be at least F-cups at the time I was struck by them. From the hardness and the way they moved, I figured they were probably at least 80% silicone, so I assumed they were probably about B-cups to begin with.

      Fuck, now I'll have to explain just how stupid I am. <br/> 
 <br/> 
1) hateandwar posited that being married to God is hot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2) Nuns are married to God, therefore they are hot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3) Many older gay men that I know went to Catholic school, and they maintain an obsessive fear and awe of the nuns who routinely punished them.  I posit that they might be inclined to point out the error of hateandwar's thinking by rapping his knuckles with a ruler. <br/> 
 <br/> 
4) Some proportion of the population, including a subset of gay-men-who-were-punished-by-nuns-in-Catholic-school, are into S&M.  Therefore, they might be happy to rap hateandwar's knuckles for free, if he's into that sort of thing.

      What I meant was being like, married to the actual entity that is God, not some silly metaphor where I'm celibate as part of my religious devotions. I understand how it got away from me, and I can follow the thought process that lead to this gay-BDSM-ruler business. It's not at all what I meant to imply, but if we're all so uncomfortable with the idea of me doin' it with the Lord in Heaven, I can totally understand why you'd all rather I have a much more tame (comparatively speaking) Nun fetish.

      This has nothing to do with your post, but is instead regarding your status.  When I move my mouse over your icon, it says "Portland's best pizza".  Where, pray tell, is this pizza?

      in my opinion Apizza Scholls has the best pizza.  ken's artisan is also pretty damn good.  my only beef is that you can't get takeout from either place and because it's pizza there is inevitably the table of untamed screaming hippie children.

      I imagine that there would be mass quantities of PBR consumed.  I believe that Portland consumes something like 60% of the nation's PBR.  Most people I know in other parts of the country don't drink it so much.

      Now, when you say bukkake waterboarding, are you describing a method of torture where a woman is strapped to a board and men repeatedly ejaculate on her head/chest until she is driven insane and will give them any information they need.  Or did you mean wakeboarding or something similar.

The secret truth, of course, is that feminists are just as hot as any other women, plus we come with the added bonus of thinking for ourselves! Though I imagine I am mainly preaching to the choir, as Achewood readers tend toward intelligence.

      Yeah! Represent the feminists of Achewood! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personally, I hate the chicks that work at Hooters more than the guys who go there. Actually, that's not true. Let's say I hate them both equally. But, yeah, I get it - it's easy work for okay pay and great tips. The only price is the undoing of the work of women trying to gain equality over the last century, and stating that yes, it is okay for women to be objectified and basically nothing more than sex objects who exist for the pleasure of men. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus, you're right; bitch is fugly. <br/>

(I'm pretty sure I've brought up feminism on at least 60% of recent strips.)

      If you think it's objectification to have your physical attributes appreciated, perhaps you should wear a burqa to keep yourself from committing the same sin as the Hooters girls. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The truth is, most women want to be viewed as attractive  <em>and</em>  have equal rights. Just because you wear tight clothes at your job doesn't mean you're undoing the past century's feminist progress. Women dress in provocative clothing everywhere - not just at Hooters, and not just for pay. Doing so does not automatically forfeit your self-respect or sense of equality, and likewise being oggled doesn't make you merely an object.

      What a well thought out response. But how is hooters any different from a strip club, where women ARE being objectified? The only difference I can tell is that strippers take off their clothes and turn tricks rather than serve food and bend over to show their cleavages.

      I think the center of the debate is that most women want to be attractive, but they don't want to be treated differently because men think they are attractive.  Unless, of course, they are treated  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">better</span>  because they are attractive, then it's OK.

      I'm going to have to call bullshit on this. All objectification (which is different from appreciating someone's looks in conjunction with their personality) is detrimental. I'm sure  <em>some</em>  women fit your description, but there are plenty of women (me included) who don't. I don't like men to pull out my chair for me, for example, and it's not because I think they're just trying to get in my pants. It's because I think they are looking at me as a one-dimensional gender stereotype (i.e., an object) instead of as a person.

      Yeah, exactly. Thorfinn, you're describing the idea that women are happy being appreciated for nothing more than their looks. Well, of course, some women are - but for the most part, we like to think that we have more to offer than just standing there and looking pretty. <br/>

      This is in response to your earlier post about men pulling out chairs and whatnot.  I always hold doors and pull out chairs for dates, but I don't believe it necessarily reinforces gender stereotypes.  I always just thought of it as a nice thing to do, not because I think of the woman as inferior, but rather to show her that I think she is special.  I don't feel that being a gentleman implies that the lady is beneath me, but rather that I am glad that she wants to spend time with me and want to make sure that she knows this.

      Yeah, the whole concept of that old-fashioned chivalry type of etiquette is pretty problematic. On the one hand, it's almost always done with good intentions. On the other hand, it does reinforce outdated gender roles. I appreciate that men are trying to be nice when they do that sort of stuff, but I don't want to be treated as special because of my gender, especially when that special treatment implies to many that I'm delicate or fragile or incapable of doing practical everyday things for myself. Maybe pulling out chairs for your girlfriend of a year is different from pulling out a chair for a girl on your first date with her; the first would be treating her as special because of what she means to you personally, whereas the second would be based only on gender.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, though I'm sure this doesn't apply to you, there are a lot of guys out there who consider themselves respectful of women because they open doors and pull out chairs, but who wouldn't think to help their wife with laundry, or who wouldn't date women who are smarter than they are because they'd be intimidated. That chivalrous etiquette is part of an old set of values where men and women have very specific roles (men go to work and pull out chairs for ladies, who stay at home to cook and raise the children). It's very easy for those forms of politeness to become a way of blinding yourself to your own internalized sexism, because you think there's no way you could be a sexist when you go out of your way to treat women well by opening doors for them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know. It's certainly not the most egregious error against feminism, and I'm sure there are plenty of women who'd disagree with me, but all in all, I'm pretty against that kind of thing.

      I think it's one of those gray areas where the action is not intrinsically sexist, but the motivation behind the action could make it so.  When I hold a door for a woman, it is to show her that I think she is special.  This is even true on a first date, because even if I do not know the woman that well, there is something special about her that made me want to date her in the first place.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are, however, a lot of guys that are just like you described, holding doors and pulling out chairs solely for the purpose of appearing to respect women. Their only motivation is trying to make the woman they are dating think that they are respectful, as they believe that this will aid them in bedding their date more rapidly.  These guys give the rest of us a bad name, as well as making it far more difficult for you ladies to tell the difference between a guy who is truly sincere and one who is just trying to get into your pants. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I knew that a woman I was dating was uncomfortable with me holding doors or pulling out chairs, I would stop, but everyone I've dated seems to appreciate the gesture, because everyone, male or female, likes to feel special.

      Hmm. I'm trying to examine my own views and see if they are contradictory. I guess I don't mind a guy hitting on me because he thinks I'm good-looking, as long as it's in an everyday sort of setting. If I meet a guy in class who flirts with me upon meeting me, I'm not offended by that. I rather enjoy it, in fact. I wouldn't want to be in a situation where my  <em>job</em>  was just to look good, in which I existed in a fixed location which men knew they could come to in order to ogle good-looking women. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And either way, if a guy was just trying to bang me based only on my looks, I'd much rather have him hit on me sleazily than pull out chairs for me. I appreciate a certain level of honesty and frankness. I actually don't even mind catcalls, though it seems most women do, and I can definitely understand why. <br/>

Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself.

      I don't think you are contradicting yourself, you are actually clarifying some of the statements you made earlier.  Being desired makes a person feel good, regardless of what they are being desired for (except in those weird, creepy stalker situations, but we're not talking about those here).  While you may not be interested in guys who only appreciate you for your looks, it still makes you feel good that they think you're hot.   The honesty thing makes sense too, as it's nice to know where you stand with people, rather than having to figure out what they actually want while they put up a front to conceal their true motives.

      People who are okay with making their identity all about one thing (as in sexuality or gender) are usually pretty boring, because you always know what they're going to say. (It's always going to relate to their sexuality, either in content or in intent.)  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Being boring is the worst sin of all.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Boring means having nothing useful or new to add to basic human interactions. Boring means being predictable. It means being unenlightened, it means being uninspired, being simple or being traditional for no other reason than being frightened of being new.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sexism is boring. As is racism. I know I should probably care about the morality of such opinions before caring about their originality, but that's what gets me first - that people can still hold such little narrow opinions that I already know and have already been debated and defeated a long time ago.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't particularly care about what you do with your crazy bits, and I don't care what chromosome kicked into action when you were being developed in your mother's uterus and it made you have girl parts or boy parts or this type of skin or that. That's all boring, and arbitrary, and moreover it's a matter of chance than observation, deliberation, and action.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In short, what you say or do independent of all characteristics says volumes more than who you are. If you can take your actions and opinions and place them in a vacuum independent of yourself and if it's still pretty cool to think about, well, you're something. You're worth listening to. You're worth everyone's time.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's probably harder than it sounds.  <br/>

      Sir, not only do you have a profile entirely composed of A Bit of Fry and Laurie quotes, but you share opinions that would make Oscar Wilde want to give you Maximum Cuddles.

      So much potential for masculine hooting about breasts, and here we have a sensible, interesting feminist discussion. You people? All great. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm going to weigh in despite the conversation being an old one, just to share something that came to mind while reading. It's nothing grand or new, just a distinction that popped into my head: there's gestures like door-opening or such that go coupled with "please, let me" - as in "I like helping people; may I help you, please?". Then there's such gestures that go coupled with "let me HELP you with that" - the sort Teodor says to Ray when he's being foolish with fonts. As in "I couldn't possibly bear standing here watching you ineffectually try to open that door yourself; it's my duty to, and besides, your feebleness disgusts me." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Alright, that's hyperbole, and I don't think hyperbole usually has a place in such discussions - it just creates a third party everyone can hate rather than resolving anything - but does it sort of make sense? That if people only perfomed such gestures because they just plain like opening doors and holding chairs, it'd happen a lot less, but it'd be a lot more honest and a lot less skeezy and dehumanising?

      "All objectification (which is different from appreciating someone's looks in conjunction with their personality) is detrimental" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I totally disagree. I think your own argument is unravelled by the convoluted way you phrased it - condoning "appreciating someone's looks in conjunction with their personality". <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you literally mean this, then you're saying objectifying is okay, as long as you know whether or not somebody has the same hobbies as you. Which sounds a little bit ridiculous, both from a logical standpoint, and a practical standpoint. (If you see somebody walking down the street, and find them attractive, do you feel suddenly guilty unless you run up to them and quiz them on their life?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would agree that "de-subjectifying" somebody is bad - treating them like a 'thing' with no perspective of their own. But that is not what most non-psychopathic people do when they ogle somebody. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Re: the whole strippers thing. There are strippers who consider themselves feminists, and see no contradiction in what they do. (We just had a public meeting in my neighbourhood about this issue; i've met some of these people.) For them, their audience is not "looking at [them] as a one-dimensional gender stereotype" - neither do they need to add the disclaimer "you can look at me as long as you are aware of my interest in nuclear physics". <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Appreciating the way someone looks" is not the same thing as stripping them of their subjectivity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the same time, there are people who DO do this; like i said, psychopaths, misogynists, idiots - and this is prevalent in our society. But the hate THEY deserve should not be showered upon Hooters waitresses, strippers, and everyone who's ever ogled somebody.

      I don't hate on the Hooters girls, really, but there is a difference between working at Hooters and wearing provocative clothing on the street. I like to have my physical attributes appreciated, but not at the expense of my other, more important attributes. The vast majority of the folks who patronize Hooters  <em>are</em>  objectifying the waitresses. They don't go in there and think, "Man, this girl has a great sense of humor and awesome tits!" They go in there to appreciate women only as objects. I think that's a problem to take up more with the customers than with the waitresses, but either way, it's hella lame.

      And the girls who work there know this. Nobody's forcing them to work at Hooters. Maybe they like it. Maybe they don't care if they're being objectified, eh? <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the waitresses are, by their own choice and actions, putting themselves in a situation in which they might as well hold up a sign reading "OBJECTIFY ME!"  <br/> 
 <br/> 
My point is that Hooters waitresses can't complain about being objectified because it's their own choice. And other women are free to complain if they want but it just makes them look petty to me. Why should they care? If Patty is happy about/okay with having a job which causes men to objectify her, why does that matter to or affect Jane?

      Because Patty's acceptance of her objectification is part of a huge social system wherein the objectification of women is deemed acceptable. More than acceptable, it's normal. Both Patty and Jane are a part of that system, and when Patty strengthens that system, it affects Jane indirectly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, like I said, I don't really hate on the Hooters girls. They are doing more good in the world than, say, women who lobby for abstinence-only sex education in schools. I don't think becoming a waitress at Hooters is the best choice in the world, but I'd rather criticize the system than the waitresses. Their choice to work at Hooters is, after all, largely a byproduct of that system.

      Judge the audience, not the author/exotic dancer. I'm actually with Tekende on this one. Back in the day, places like Hooters might have been representative of the greater trend of prejudice against women, but in our modern society such places are pretty easily in a decline in popularity. If a guy goes into Hooters, he's likely not harbouring any misconceptions about how the girls in there are representative of the gender as a whole. He probably isn't going to come out again with a significantly lowered perception of females. Well, some might, but the actions of idiots are hard to account for. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I personally don't think that the continued existence of places like Hooters is having a negative effect on the progress of the feminist movement. Strippers, prostitutes, glamour models (New term to me) and all the other professions that centre around making money through the use of one's physical attributes will likely always exist, and simply because of the greater desire of men to seek satisfaction in the area, there will likely be an equal tendency towards females in such professions. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But it's how others view these things that really matter. Like I said, in our current society we'd be more likely to judge the clients of such an establishment than the employees, and quite rightly. Like someone glibly commented earlier, it's the idiocy of men that is being exploited, more than the physicality of women.

      I'm a feminist and I don't really have a problem with the Hooters girls. As long as a person understands there's nothing wrong with not fitting that mold, I don't think it's wrong to appreciate a certain type of beauty. My problem is with all the "should-nots" people tend to toss out... one side saying "you should not allow someone to stare at you like that," the other side saying "you should not set your own boundaries" or "you should not be fat, you should not go without makeup, etc"

      I don't understand how someone could "hate" either of them, least of all the girls who work there.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The girls are trying to make a living, and probably being treated pretty badly in some ways in the process. Most people in the world have that experience; and it's not (all) controlled by sexism, it's money. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The customers could be good or bad, there's nothing controlling how they interpret what they're doing. I would vary my hate for them based on how they treat the staff. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If anyone deserves the hate, it's the people who own the franchise, exploiting both their employees and the wider cultural situation.

      Agreed in that Hooters just implies the things that people go to strip clubs for so why not just go to a strip club. <br/> 
I've only been to one once on a whim, and it was the lollest experience I've had to date, what with them putting out popcorn at one point in order to encourage more $6 drink ordering. I also went with another girl, which apparently can't happen unless you have a male escort, which is kind of bizarre. <br/> 
I would not do it twice a week. <br/> 
I do, however, suggest the idea whenever any of my friends decouple.

      Molly's lectures are legit, and she's almost always lecturing Beef.  We might as well all admit that Beef often needs to be reminded of certain things.   <br/>

Pat, on the other hand, will lecture anyone within earshot, and on topics that none of the other characters seem to care about.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, being engaged to someone means having to listen to their lectures.  No one (thank heavens) is engaged to Pat.

      I disagree with this.  Molly isn't perfect.  She left Beef when he was uncomfortable about moving in with her.  She is just more of a subtle imperfect than the other characters, though, because no one really says anything bad about her or seems to notice her mistakes.  She's a lady, after all.

      Funny story. I know a dude who CANNOT ESCAPE BREAST IMPLANTS. His sister (who was also a stripper who got in trouble with the law for having a human skull or some some shit in her apt) got them, and he hated her for it. Then he starts dating this chick who happens to have  <em>massive bubblies</em> . He later finds out that, alas, his girlfriend also has breast implants. I think he broke up with her for that reason, but they were pretty obvious. POINT OF STORY: Do not ever get robot boobs if you plan on appealing to the general populace. I mean, come on ladies.

      Just think, all the money poured into fake breasts could be going towards actually awesome implants.  Like rocket-punch fists.  Or jetpack feet.  Imagine getting breast implants--but the implants are rocket launchers!  Go Nagai style. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I blame Shadowrun for instilling these thoughts in me.

Okay, everyone, there is a Yahoo group set up for the attempt to organize the Great Southwest Acheworld Meetup. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So if you are in the US southwest (Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, etc.) and are interested in joining other Achewood fans to turn the mother out, then  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145323/https://groups.yahoo.com/group/gin_ocean/">click here and join.</a>

      I wish I could give this one higher than a 5.  It is yet another instance of a strip which leads me into a fit of cackling hysterics at precisely the same time that it leaves me emotionally devastated. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I quite enjoy that one of the side-effects is 'Delusion and Self-Evisceration', a phrase in which an aptly chosen conjunction makes it unclear whether the self-evisceration is as a result of delusion, or rather a completely separate phenomena.

      At the very least I would call it a good example of an achewood strip, it has the mix of comedy and true emotion that is unique to achewood. It does things that usually can only be accomplished in a good book, and it still manages to do the things normally expected of a web-comic as well.

      Definitely among the best of '08. Some ways down the all-time list, though. <br/>
