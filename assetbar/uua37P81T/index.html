      I had to unignore assetbar-admin in order to reply to his comment and give you all this warning:  Your accounts have been hijacked and lashed to some lamebot script that aiu has concocted.  He brags about it in the comment above.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I followed the link he provides to an old comment by assetbar_admin (the real admin account for AssetBar).  I never lamed that comment, but there's my name, saying I lamed it, along with over 300 other users.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you visit AssetBar, you are automatically laming some comment of aiu's choosing.  He is also changing your account's statistics in the process. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Have a day, pod-people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Maybe AssetBar should hire aiu as a security consultant.  He'd just spend his whole day trying to break things, like he does now, only he'd get paid, and they could keep him in a test area.)

      you're being paranoid.  All assetbar functions are working normally, and they have been all along.  The problem is simply that it has been possible to cause other users to perform some of these functions by calling these functions via image tags.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
For example, normally, an image tag might call an image at example.com: <br/> 
 <br/> 
{img}https://example.com/image.jpg{/img} <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, if instead, you put an assetbar function in there like this: <br/> 
 <br/> 
{img}https://assetbar.com/function_X{/img} <br/> 
 <br/> 
then every time someone's browser attempts to load the image, assetbar will think that the browser is requesting for it to perform function_X, and so assetbar will perform this function. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for the image that is saying "please ignore me," be aware that I originally had these image URLs redirecting to assetbar functions (lame and chuppy) via a server-side redirect.  I now have these image URLs redirecting to the image you see now (asking to be ignored) because I'm done fucking with assetbar's functions.  It would be ideal if these accounts could be put on the global ignore list so that people don't have to see that shit anymore, but whatever.  If you really are concerned about security, know that although I'm not going to, it is still technically possible for me to redirect these image URLs back to assetbar functions, so ignoring any comment with these images is your safest course of action. <br/> 
 <br/> 
hopefully they will rewire assetbar such that it is no longer possible to rate comments and strips via URLs like this, with almost no authentication.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Note that I did not fuck with the ratings of any strips.  All I did was to give lames to the assetbar_admin account, and chuppies to gladi8orrex.  I didn't quite make it to 9,000 chuppies for Glad before assetbar partially crashed again today, I presume due to taking too many hits, but I am close enough so I called it a day. <br/>

sorry for any trouble this may have caused.  it was intended as non-malicious.  By exposing these weaknesses, they will hopefully be corrected before someone gets the idea to use them to really fuck everything up. <br/>

    <span class="comment-text hideable">
      the problem with the assetbar's heuristics (or  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224024059/https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Eigenvector.html">Eigenvector</a>  as assetbar_admin calls them in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224024059/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua9ZSjkn#comment_60">this post</a> )is that assetbar assumes (incorrectly) that 'events' will happen with a certain average frequency in time. (e.g. making a post without it being lamed to hell is a positive event, having a post lamed to hell is a negative event.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem is that the user can essentially 'travel' in this artificial time continuum by making multiple posts in rapid succession.  The protection against this is that a user is only allowed to make one post per day, until the user has enough positive events.  The problem with this protection is that each time a user views a strip, this is counter as a positive event.  So simply viewing about a hundred strips fixes this.  Any number of automated methods can be used to view multiple strips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem isn't that a user is willing to go to extreme lengths to circumvent the heuristics system.  These lengths are not extreme and are well within the means of the average school-age kid.  It's kind of like the prison-guard dilemma; prison guards have a life.  The prisoners they guard (in this case 13 yr old kids) have unlimited time on their hands to think about ways to break the system. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But like I say, the problem, at least so far, has not been the lengths that users (user?) has gone to, the problem has simply been one simple flaw in the heuristics.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now if the heuristics would NOT assume incorrectly that events will happen with an average frequency, and instead would go to the trouble of keeping track of the passage of time, that would be a whole lot better.  Of course, you can't have the system only accept positive events at a rate of say, one per 12 hours, and discard the rest, because what if a user goes ahead and reads all the strips in the first 24 hours he is on the site?  That's it then, there would be no more strips to read.  So, with respect to using strips read as a positive event, the heuristics would have to cache these events, and would have to allow them to trickle in at a reasonable rate, and even then, only if the user was also, simultaneously, positively engaged in the community.  e.g., if the balance of the user's activity is positive over the past 12 hours, then go ahead and count another strip read as a positive event.  If the user has not been logged in over the past 12 hours, then do nothing except wait.  don't discard the cache of positive events, and don't count them either. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, when it comes to actually making comments, the event of making a comment probably doesn't need to be cached, because comments are a renewable resource so to speak.  Over the course of 12 hours, you might want to count only the user's most negative comment event, and discard all the rest... this way, if a user makes 50 comments off in the archives that don't get rated because no one sees them, they don't count as positive events.  In fact, for that matter, no comment should count as a positive event unless it gets some chuppies.  That would solve two problems... one, it would not give the user positive reputation simply for making empty comments off in the archives, and two, it would not give the user positive reputation simply for making comments of average quality.  It would REQUIRE the user to make an above average contribution in order to build reputation, and again, like I say if only one positive event per 12 hours is counted, it would require the user to build reputation over time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Finally, I don't believe that it's cool to only allow the user to make ONE comment per day when they first sign up.  It should be two or three or four.  New users should be WELCOME to participate.  Allowing them to only make one comment and then telling them to shut up is not welcoming them, it's going to discourage a lot of quality users from joining.  You shouldn't START with the assumption that the user is a douche and require the user to prove himself.  Instead, START with the assumption that the user is cool, and allow the heuristics to give the user negative events as needed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd say, maybe allow all users the ability to make Y number of total comments up to a limit of X, with X being limited initially to say, 3, and with Y being decremented every time a new comment is made.  Y would be automatically incremented by one unit, up to limit X, say, every 2 hours.  As positive reputation accrues, limit X is increased. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The reason why assetbar is such a frustrating place right now, full of spam, trolling, douchebaggery, and for that matter a general ambiance of mediocrity, is that users don't have to WORK to acquire positive reputation.  It's given out for free, under the assumption that if you've been around a while and haven't been lamed to death or ignored by a bunch of people, then hey, you must be pretty cool, which unfortunately is NOT the case. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that assetbar has a lot cooler users back in the day, who generated a lot more quality content, and the reason for this, I would wager, is that back in the day, assetbar was much more restrictive in who could join and participate, not due to it's heuristics, but due to the fact that achewood was a much lesser known strip.  I think as more and more people with less and less to contribute started hanging out on assetbar, it sort of brought the general level of discourse down further and further into more and more mundane strata.  This is not to say that many of the present users are not capable of interesting and valuable discussion, it is simply to say that it's simply a sort of snowball effect;  we're kind of lowering the standards of the environment for each other and for ourselves, and this environment feeds back into our mindsets, and so I think the discussion on here is less interesting and valuable than it could be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So there you go, that's my take on it all. <br/> 
-AIU.

      so I woke up today with a hard-on (as usual) wanting to take pictures of it and send these to females on the internet.  so this wasn't a conscious impulse, it was totally built in and automatic, because I had this impulse already while I was in the process of waking up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
so anyway, women have tits and pussy and they wear tight and revealing clothing <br/> 
 <br/> 
but guys, it's not really a custom for guys to wear tight and revealing clothing around their penis unless they're gay, or in some kinda sport, and even then, it's not really considered too cool to sport a huge erection under your penis hugging panties. <br/> 
 <br/> 
yet women can sport erect nipples under their breast hugging attire.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
anyway, it's interesting, how woman's sexuality is regarded and treated totally different from man's sexuality. <br/> 
 <br/> 
you know what I think is sad, is anyone who totally buys into these gender roles and the tripe simplistic justifications for them, without even really being aware that they're there.

      I think that's why simple minds find rock 'n roll to be offensive and/or threatening.  because dude, the whole ethic and dress code and behavior of rock 'n roll is somewhat spasmodic, and a little random, which is basically the anti-thesis of the simplistic static environment that simplistic minds seek to cultivate for themselves.

      Issac pulled on his seatbelt, and started to turn the key when he paused. <br/> 
His walk to the car had been troubled by something, itching at the back of his mind.  Just now, as the ignition lights had flashed on his dashboard, resembling a cash register screen, he had remembered. <br/> 
     In his rush to get back to his condo, and the two avon sales women who were getting puzzled on red wine to steel their nerves for 'the experiment', Issac hadn't said a word to the clerk. <br/> 
     Issac hung his head, disappointment swelling in his chest, like the bottom lip that was slowly protruding to form his sheepish expression. <br/> 
     He had hurt the one man that had always been there for him. <br/> 
     The clerk that listened patiently to a young boy's stories about his dead father's football, waiting a full 5 minutes before politely asking Issac if he was going to buy the Cadbury Egg that he had absent-mindedly left in the pocket of his Zubaz. <br/> 
     The clerk who helped a caring, but distant, step father pick out Issac's favorite candy, to help soften the blow of his mother's sudden and vicious death at the Otis manufacturing plant. <br/> 
     Issac rose from the car, and began striding back to the innocent glow of the convenience store.  His eyes already rimmed in red, he was afraid to meet the gaze of the clerk, to feel the shame of what he did, before the words even spilled from his lips. <br/> 
     But before Issac reached the gaze of the automatic door sensor, the clerk looked up from tampons he was scanning, and looked right at him.  Issac stopped, feeling his shame and torment drain out his through his feet, replaced by the relief that flooded in through his eyes. <br/> 
     The clerk  <em>knew</em> .  And he had already forgiven Issac with a glance, acknowledging his penitent march back to the store with a small nod, and a hint of a smile at the corner of his beard-framed lips. <br/> 
     issac smiled back, turned on his heel as he fingered the wetness from the corner of his eyes, and headed back to the car with new determination. <br/> 
     He and the clerk both had work to do.  And those cosmeticians weren't going to do themselves. <br/> 
     ...at least, not until  <em>Issac</em>  got there.

      Lifelessness is an ambiguous concept, it could mean anything from torpidity to unconsciousness to complete expiration. Having the shit bashed out of you by two elevators leaves a lot less to chance.

Speaking from experience, it will be good for his depression for about six years (maybe only six cat years?), then it will come back for various reasons (less frequent tang a less powerful motivator, old friends stop bein bachelors and new married-couple friends aint the same, etc) and the second time around, beef watch out because molly aint gonna be a sweetheart no more.

      I'll go to the store now and then just for the experience of having a clerk ring me up for a pack of condoms... the cost of the rubbers is a fair price to pay for creating the impression in at least one person's mind that I get laid. <br/>

      Yeah, Beef realizes it's just not a big deal to buy condoms.  In fact, it is a simple transaction. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personally as these things go, I don't mind buying condoms--they mean I'm getting my freak on.  I sometimes wonder what the clerk is thinking when I buy condoms and diapers.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't mind buying tampons and whatnot.  Many guys I know are embarrassed by this, but to me it signals, "There is a woman at my house who allows me to know things about her vagina." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I get embarrassed buying toilet paper.  I tell people it's not for me.

      I still get occasionally embarassed about having to buy condoms at a place where I actually have to be served by a person. <br/> 
The local supermarket, on the other hand, has self-service checkouts, which are perfect. (What they do not have is a decent selection.)

      Here is what happened when I bought my first pack of condoms: <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was eleven thirty at night.  I was standing on the family planning aisle at Wal-Mart, and I was terrified.  I'd never done this before.  There were so many choices, and the wrong one could end up with either <br/> 
a)babies <br/> 
or <br/> 
b)unsatisfying sex <br/> 
As I stood at the wall, a woman walked onto the aisle.    She was a rather plump woman, with large hair.   She glided through the aisle, and we made eye contact.  She saw where I was standing, smiled warmly, and nodded once.  She reached up, grabbed an industrial size of Vagisil, and waltzed away. <br/> 
After that, I lost all fear.  I bought my condoms.  Much sex happened.

      Character growth?  In my Achewood? <br/>

I had to buy condoms once when I was seventeen.  I went to two convenience stores in the same intersection and had to go to an CVS pharmacy.  Not embarrassed, everything is cool, until a guy who knew my mom and sister from church and his son used to soccer with my boyfriend AND regularly had dinner with my boyfriend's parents got in line behind me.  I grabbed two boxes of cheese its to hide condoms from that guy and pretended I didn't know him.  I never heard anything about it so I think everything worked out.

      I don't mean to be mean but just my first impression based on your cultural background is that the idea of sex with you at 17 might be as attractive as the idea of sex with George W. Bush's daughters, (both at the same time, even) or Cheney's daughter Mary, the lesbian.  And I am always hot for lesbians so that's saying a lot. <br/>

However, if there were boxes of cheese involved in the sex act, then we might be able to get along.

      i don't think that Onstad knows that the free assetbar is fucking up.  his username ("Onstad") isn't in the list of people who have auto-magically lamed assetbar_admin (for more about that see the post by assetbar-admin towards the top of this page) <br/> 
 <br/> 
when the pay assetbar was hacked the other day, they disabled the chubby/lame function within a few hours.  it would be no trouble to do the same for the free assetbar, but they haven't done that yet.

      thanks for the chuppy although in this crazy bubble chuppy economy it's hard to know anymore what is the value of a chuppy or lame. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am ending the chuppie/lame hack in a few hours from now when gladi8orrex's total chuppy count reches over 9000.  only 1800 chuppies to go.

      I worked as a cashier in a grocery store a couple summers back. Condoms were by no means the worst thing I ever saw. I had no idea that we sold enemas or that anyone even used enemas anymore (outside of the bizarre sex contingent) until someone brought one through my check-out lane (definitely had to specify the kind of lane in that sentence as the phrase "brought an enema through my lane" is wont to encourage scurrilous thoughts.) The one time someone bought a pack of condoms, they didn't bother to obfuscate and it was, in fact, accompanied only by the largest case of our cheapest beer.
