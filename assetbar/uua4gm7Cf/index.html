      I like to think they are all twenties, because that is about as much money as a grandparent is willing to put inside a birthday card. It is an amount she can appreciate. He gives her twenties for each grandkid and one to get herself that fancy eyeglass lanyard her good eye has been fixed on.  <br/>

      Cavortia was not the oldest prostitute in the city, nor  <br/> 
by the estimation of some detractors even the most  <br/> 
beautiful, but nonetheless, she was by far the most  <br/> 
expensive and the wealthiest. She did not cater to the  <br/> 
baser tastes of smelly nomads and raunchy seamen, but  <br/> 
to the more refined whims of wealthy merchants from the  <br/> 
old families, brave ships' captains, and exotic  <br/> 
adventuring heroes from distant countries. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Need did not drive her to her profession, as it did  <br/> 
some impoverished girls, for she came from an old  <br/> 
landed-family, and enjoyed a close relationship with  <br/> 
them. She attended a respectable university in the  <br/> 
city, and was well-educated and intelligent.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But her sexual appetite was perversely insatiable --  <br/> 
from the time of her first awakening sensuality, she  <br/> 
desired nothing more of life than to constantly feel  <br/> 
the deep probes of a man's fine tool inside her and  <br/> 
pressing down upon her while she gyrated her pelvis and  <br/> 
clutched his rippling muscles in her long-fingered  <br/> 
hands until her vagina seemed to dissolve in the  <br/> 
sweetness of orgasm. She felt lucky to have been  <br/> 
honored by acceptance into the guild of licensed  <br/> 
independent prostitutes, and to have made a lucrative  <br/> 
profession of her favorite pastime.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But even such an exquisite pleasure as being paid  <br/> 
handsomely for engaging unceasingly in one's favorite  <br/> 
sport, and enjoying a ceaseless series of orgasms, can  <br/> 
become tiresome after a few years of constant  <br/> 
overindulgence. She had been in the profession for five  <br/> 
or six years and, not caring to increase her ample  <br/> 
riches, became more discerning in her choice of  <br/> 
customers.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cavortia gradually winnowed her amorous engagements to  <br/> 
the point where she had much free time, which she  <br/> 
devoted mainly to the study of ancient literature. She  <br/> 
was passionate about classical poetry and read all of  <br/> 
the books she could find. Only rarely did she see even  <br/> 
her favorite customers. When she did, it was chiefly  <br/> 
for the sheer joy of sharing with them her favorite  <br/> 
pleasurable exercise, and after a time, she ceased to  <br/> 
even consider any payment from her chosen few  <br/> 
bedfellows. In essence, she retired from the active  <br/> 
profession to the quiet life of a wealthy single woman  <br/> 
with a number of eager suitors and a few close friends.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Her favorite partner of all men she had ever met was a  <br/> 
foreign merchant and adventurer by the name of  <br/> 
Magnanimo, whom she met through a mutual acquaintance  <br/> 
during her fourth year in the profession. He was a  <br/> 
strapping specimen: a tall, broad-shouldered man of  <br/> 
Elysium whose people were widely renowned for their  <br/> 
incredible strength and stamina.  <br/>

      ...Not to mention that it's a total slam on the cheesy appropriation of Calvin for tacky inter-auto company rivalries displayed by classless folk who wouldn't know a transmogrifier from a hole in the ground.  Onstad's admitted to being a Watterson fan in interviews, and I'd like to think that by having Calvin peeing into a proper receptacle (possibly even the same one with which he demonstrated the "flushing toilet paper off the roll" trick which brought me so much joy in my youth) rather than on a corporate logo, he's giving a salute to the man by "taking Calvin back".

      I respectfully disagree. The icon, even alone, is clearly not Calvin being used to the misunderstood whimsy of a truck-owning sports fan, and beside that we have the fraternity between Chris n' Bill through both their cartooning occupation and also the same engagement in which you or I can take part -- reading Calvin and Hobbes. Any of us can "take Calvin back," per se, because we are all in understanding of Calvin's emotions and functions beyond the truck owner's assumption that he is simply a spunky little brat, and in a way, that makes him ours as well as Watterson's.

      There is an amazing amount of posturing... But is it amazing in the sense of being unexpected?  I think it's just human nature.  I think it's more noticeable on assetbar than in, say, real life, because here on assetbar, you can't really exchange winks and nods and send signals with body language and facial expressions, try as some may.  There's no hemming and hawing and guafauing possible on assetbar, at least, not with as fine a resolution as one can achieve in the medium of 'real life.'  The cultural lexicon of assetbar is very tightly constrained, by limitations inherent in the media, in such matters as social interaction, so when people do send social signals, and when people do posture, it's fantastically more obvious and noticeable in this medium than 'in real life.'  Probably some people, such as yourself, are more aware of the social dialogue than others are, so what to some seems like empty rhetoric not unlike some politician glad-handing with a fake smile and telling people what she knows they want to hear, to others seems quite natural and normal.  People who are more self-aware and who are more aware of this social dialogue are probably much more discrete about their participation in it.  Together with awareness of social interaction goes general level of literacy and fluency in the non-social side of the subject matter being discussed, be that for examples an intellectual side, a comedic side, an abstract component, and/or a technical component to the subject of discussion... The more fluent and adoit a person is in the subject of discussion, the more she can weave her social interaction into this subject matter, therefore giving her an expanded lexicon with which to project herself  and therefore come across as more, shall we say, 'real,' as opposed to being restricted to the box of the banal and obvious, therefore coming across as 'fake,' superficial, and even superfluous. <br/>

      I know. <br/> <br/> <br/> At work we do goat milking (it's a farm petting zoo) and one of the goats (Milkshake) occasionally just yells her fucking lungs out while we milk her. On my first day there, I was participating in this milking event and another employee, a middle-aged woman, was leaning on the fence and commiserating with the angry Saanen goat. "I know, sweetie," she said. "I know." After about two minutes of her insistence that she knew, I finally snapped and remarked, in front of approximately ten parents and twenty small children, "When's the last time you were milked, [name deleted]?"

      Uh... have you been to a UC school recently?  I'm just saying, because I work two blocks from UC-San Diego, so I catch frequent glimpses of the student body going to and from school.  UCSD, Cal-Berkeley, UC-Davis, UCLA, et al. have a very large Asian-American student population. <br/>

      I think that was his point. There are so many qualified Asian applicants to top-end schools that many of them, in California and elsewhere, have been forced to adopt a de facto affirmative action policy against them in the name of diversity, and  <em>despite</em>  this there are still a lot of them.

      I find that the Lexus line of cars tend to be assholes, the thought process being that their insurance is better than yours, and they don't particularly like their car enough to want to preserve it if you piss them off. Owners of BMWs, however, exhibit good driving manners, if only because they seem to value their cars.

      You still listen to Loud Rumbling Engines?  Lame.  Ever since they signed to a major label, they've been cranking out mass-produced 4-cylinder pop for emo high school kids.  I remember back when they used to be cool.  I saw them in 1982, in a club in Detroit.  It was the best show I've ever seen.  It was right after they released that split 7-inch with the Crying Infants.  Man, it used to be all about the  <em>music</em> .

      Partying with grannies can be fun as hell.  I have three friends -- sisters from Alabama -- whose mother, at approximately 75, is a hard-drinking, chain-smoking, piece of work, and we love her.  At the reception for one of the sisters' wedding, her mother came up to me and another friend, cigarette hanging off her lip, put an arm around each of us, and half-croaked, half-drawled, lingering on every syllable: "I hope y'all are ready for some sayyrious drankin'."

      When I was in middle school I used to always throw the change I got in the lunch line down at other tables, and watch them scamper for my nickel-and-copper detritus.  <br/>

      This reminds me of the way we got other kids to do stupid, stupid things for tiny amounts of money.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like the guy who drank half a bottle of Heinz 57 for $0.20, in one long chug. It was masterful. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or the guy who was bet $10 (class money, at the time) to stick his hand in a fire ant hive for one solid minute.  <br/>

The best part was we kept the $10. He only lasted 55 seconds.

      One of my friends, who is coincidentally now my roommate, was always rather fascinated with the comedic possibilities of feces, which may or may not be on account of his being Japanese. He was also somewhat rich. You can imagine the results of this combination. After a number of relatively minor and harmless assignments such as getting someone to lick the floor of the physics lab for a dollar, he hatched his ultimate plan, which was to have a whole bunch of people to chip in for a sum large enough to make someone actually eat shit. After he spent several weeks somehow convincing one of the weird outcast kids  (that is, weirder than the rest of us) who was sort of friends with a couple of people in our group to do it for $100 and getting 50 people to agree to chip in $2 each to watch, it turned out that only six people showed up in the end. Having already overcome god knows what amount of mental resistance to agree to this, and gone so far as to be standing there on the baseball field with a paper plate of his own turd that my friend had obligingly cut into bite-sized pieces with a plastic knife and fork, I imagine that he felt that he had gone too far to turn back and just wanted the whole thing to be over with. So he agreed to do it for $24 - $4 from each spectator. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I should note that I had decided early on to have no part of this and had neither contributed money nor attended the event. Rather, this account comes from the video that was shown to me after the fact and is now forever burned into my memory. Yes, for $24, the guy had agreed not only to eat feces, but to allow it to be immortalized on tape. The camera is somewhat shaky as it zooms in onto the plate, which the kid is holding in front of him while my roommate meticulously applies the finishing touches by fully separating the turd nuggets and poking one with the fork in order to demonstrate its authenticity. You see the kid pick up the smallest piece with the fork and hold it in front of him as incoherent chatter and cries of "oh shit, he's gonna do it!" come from the direction of the camera. For a second it looks like he's going to chicken out after all, but suddenly he steadies his hand, closes his eyes, and the fork disappears into his mouth. The camera zooms in on his face. He is struggling to swallow as his face contorts in ways never before thought possible. By the time someone realizes what is about to happen and yells "yo, you have to swallow it!" it's too late, and he has spit it out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The tape stops here, but the aftermath is perhaps even worse. Because the kid did not achieve the goal of actually  <em>eating</em>  the poo, but only managed to hold it in his mouth for a bit, he was denied payment.  In the end, each person gave him a dollar in consolation and he left with $6. Somehow his parents later found out and made him go to therapy as well as forbidding him from having contact with anyone in our group of friends. To top it all off, a week later my friend left the camcorder  <em>with the tape still inside</em>  in a public place, and it was stolen. This means that the tape is theoretically still out there and could surface as a viral video any day now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Every time I tell this story I realize that my friends are awful people and I am an awful person for being friends with them.

      I have a friend who has told me a story that was almost the same (although it occurred on a trip in China and the person got a consolation $50, so it probably was not the same event). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Apparently, after it happened, the guy who had attempted to eat it told the guy it came from (it was apparently  <em>someone else's</em> ) that he could tell he'd eaten rice that day. <br/>

      You are. A few years back, I knew a guy who was eerily like Ray. He was genuinely nice and very down-to-earth, yet at the same time, the idea of not being able to afford something just never really occurred to him. One of many examples: <br/> 
 <br/> 
One day I noticed he was driving a Crown Vic. This was not his usual type of car, so I asked what he was doing with it. Long story short, he was driving by the Mercedes dealership on the way home from work and noticed that the new SL-class was out. He stopped in and promptly traded in his current car on the best SL he could get. Then he realized that he needed something to drive during the 2-3 months it would take for his special-order SL55 AMG to arrive, so he went to a rental agency and asked for the best car they had sitting on the lot. Which was the Crown Vic.

      Snopes agrees that he lived.  I couldn't find any followup report on the web, but articles from shortly after the crash indicate that he was expected to recover fully. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The other thing I found while searching is that the pedestrian was jaywalking--crossing against the "don't walk" signal.  The traffic perpendicular to him had a green light.  Given the speed of the car traveling in from the right side of the screen, he still might have been run over even if that car hadn't been hit by the car running a red light from the bottom of the screen.  Be careful out there, folks. <br/>

- "I was in the waiting room at the doctor's office today, and a young black man got up and offered me his seat! He was a fine gentleman, just as polite as could be. Can you believe that?!" <br/>

      That picture looks like a Public Service Announcement: <br/> 
 <br/> 
John was living his dream.  As a janitor in the Coast Guard, he mopped up after seasick sailors by day and partied at ports all along the Eastern Seaboard by night. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Trixie was on top of the world.  As a prostitute on the Baltimore docks, she got to meet exciting people every day and have sex with them for money. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Their perfect worlds came crashing down on a fateful night in 2002 when John's ship docked in Baltimore. <br/> 
 <br/> 
John never used a gunny sack.  Trixie had stopped taking her c--- pills because they'd caused her to gain weight. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now they're the parents of septuplets (not pictured: John Jr., currently residing in the pediatric rehab unit at Lincoln General Hospital). <br/> 
 <br/> 
John's dishonorable discharge earned him a dishonorable discharge from the Coast Guard.  Trixie's pimp fired her the minute her water broke.  Their dreams shattered, they now live in a suburban neighborhood.  John toils as a bank president to support his family, while Trixie struggles to balance the demands of parenthood with her grueling schedule as president of the political action group, Mothers Against Candy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
John and Trixie never thought this could happen to them. <br/>

      Oh see my grandparents just straight up use the N-word and give books to my father about how black people just don't have the mental faculties white people have. A good quote from the family reunion last week was, "You just never know with those Indian and Arab doctors." My dad countered by saying that actually, all Indian people are really hardworking! The most progressive we can get in my family is positive stereotypes. <br/>

      Gratuitous at this point, but since it was somewhat topical I thought I'd share my Grandfather's reason for not becoming a police officer, "I couldn't be a policeman, 'cuz I'd shoot any *[black person] who looked at me cross-eyed." <br/>

      Well to his credit, he refrained from becoming a policeman instead of becoming one just so he  <em>could</em>  do that. Given the Sean Bell case and others like it, it seems there are like-minded people without the same restraint.

      Along the same vein, my grandma is a proud Southerner with General Lee commemorative plates on her wall.

      Okay, I have to say I was just in South Carolina for the first time last week, and I was really confused about the Islamic-looking crescent. I was also confused as to why half the flags in the city of Charleston lack the crescent, but I guess maybe it's because of sentiments like your grandmother's. (To Charleston's great credit, I did not see a single Confederate flag there, not even at Fort Sumter.)

      What does anybody think about this: Shouldn't the States have the right to leave the Union?  I mean trying to keep slavery is a hell of fucked up reason, but even so, shouldn't we be able to break it up if it ain't working.  That's the part that always gets me about the Confederacy.  Not the slavery - that's disgusting.  But the freedom to opt out - that seems like a pretty reasonable thing.  No?   <br/> <br/> 
It just seems like at this point the US as a big nation does more harm than good.  I think we'd be better off as 7 or 8 smaller countries.  Try it though and Lincoln's zombie marches on your ass.

      Yea I mean I generally feel the same way - if a majority of the population of any given region wants self-determination for whatever reason, they should get it (hint: there's a war going on right now over this). But whenever you make this argument someone is always like "well if we let them do it then EVERY little ethnic region would be wanting independence," to which my answer is, "so?" The only problem I guess is when the borders are in dispute or two groups are claiming the same land. But "protecting the territorial integrity" of the larger country sounds like a BS reason to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I heard the reason we didn't let the Confederacy go is because we needed the farmland or something like that.

      There's probably dozens of such wars going on at the moment. I agree with the principle, but there's plenty of situations where it doesnt automatically follow. Is the majority large enough to justify a nation state following the majority group's wishes? Is the whole point of the idea to negate the human rights of a minority (i.e: the Confederacy? I dont know enough to say). Is it a pretext for imperialist expansion (see Sudetenland and arguably South Ossetia at the moment). <br/>

      If some state really does want to leave the union at some point in the future, that would mean that the fabric of culture and society has broken down to the point where we have a state full of fucktards, or conversely and more likely, a state full of people who are sick and tired of being part of a country where all the other states are populated chiefly by fucktards.  Either way, I guess I'm saying that we'd have bigger problems to worry about than this abstract and intellectual exercise in conjecture. <br/>

      A state deciding it wants to be independent does not necessarily have anything to do with fucktardism.  If you look at successful independence movements in the past, many of them occur because the main state is exploiting the minority state or committing atrocities at it.  This is not likely to happen again within the US, because there are SO MANY resources distributed all across the country, and Americans are happy if they are comfortable.

      Yeah I agree with you I am talking about the US states here, not states/provinces/pseudo-nations in other countries.  I think in the US fucktardism is the most likely reason why one or more states would want to split off in the foreseeable future.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah the US civil war was, as I understand it, about economic concerns and NOT about freeing the slaves.  Lincoln personally was friendly to the cause of emancipation, but he knew that he couldn't, and didn't try to, sell the North on the civil war on that basis alone.

      Confederacy is what the South wanted ie: more states' rights, not just slavery (which they tell you in school: the Civil War was NOT over slavery, it was over states' rights and secession).  Up until then people debated about states vs. federal rights more than the issues we debate today (say, welfare or abortion or gay marriage) because all those things would have been solely under states' jurisdiction but more likely is that people didn't think things like that had to be made explicitly legal or illegal.  Then the Square Deal and New Deal made the government more involved etc etc OH MAN THIS WORLD IS PRETTY COMPLICATED AND I MIGHT JUST BE TALKING OUT OF MY ASS AGAIN

      $1.50/ <strong>day</strong>  average wage in some parts of Mexico.  $6.55/ <strong>hour</strong>  minimum wage for an American worker.  How we treat immigrant workers, while it could definitely improve, is certainly not cheap or exploitative by world standards.

Due to President Bush's expansion of our aid programs, the U.S. now gives four billion dollars a year in direct developmental and humanitarian aid to Africa. His approval rating in Africa, according to a Pew survey conducted earlier this year, is in the high eighties. Here's a neat little chart from mid-2007. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <div class="img_container"><img alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100205160032im_/https://209.85.48.12/3560/8/upload/p2694174.gif" style="border:0px;"/></div> <br/>

U.S. GDP for 2007 was over four times the GDP of the closest nation (13.8 Trillion v. 4.3 Trillion for Japan). Given that the U.S. GDP composes over 25% of the world's GDP as a whole, the fact that the U.S. comes on top when you use percentages indicates an even more gaping disparity in the actual numbers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, I'm glad AIU chose to give all of us millions of his money to solve our problems. Real classy of him, you know? He doesn't get nearly enough credit for that.

      As far as I know, "the rest of the world" doesn't consist of Africa alone. If I had the energy, I would dig up the polls where Europeans consistently rank the U.S. as being one of the primary threats to world peace. Now whether or not you agree with them is another matter, but to say that we're hated in much of the developed world is hardly a "casual truism". <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for aid figures, I'd like to see them alongside the amounts of money that we've spent funding right-wing dictators, ousting democratically elected leaders, and of course invading and occupying other countries. The net difference would perhaps be a more accurate measure of "global goodwill" if such a thing even exists.

      They had Constitutional rights I think to secede but they didn't do it correctly? (Article V, which basically says if a majority of the states talk it over, we could basically change the government, secede, etc. but today it's only used for amendments).  Lincoln felt it was important to have a unified country but it might have had to do with the South's agriculture. <br/>

      Thanks for the info.   Yeah I checked it out on Wikipedia just now and damn that's some scary stuff.  With all the crazy technology and bio/machine hybrid stuff they got going on now I wouldn't be half surprised if a bunch of half-robot half-killer bees doesn't come after us all one of these days. <br/>

I guess it's a fantasy, for whatever reason, that a lot of people have, of being among a small group of the last people left alive in all civilization.  Well, there is a lot about civilization that we could do without... More and moreso every day it seems. <br/>

      The child models are rented from a guy I know.  He kidnaps grown men and women and feeds them a delicious cocktail of hormones to make them regress into childhood.  The sweater I am wearing is made of their hair.

I really should have specified that I was correcting his post, in case anyone was curious.  To save the trouble of digging through his htbb code to see what it is.  So in case anyone is curious, that's what it is.  a giant sunflower.  with philippe with rabbit ears or something.

      There is a game where one takes the model name of every SUV one sees during a ride [eg. Explorer, Navigator, Blazer] and shouts out the name preceded by the word "Anal".  Laughter and/or groans follows.  Also stony silence. <br/>

      Blastradius, <br/> 
Your comment was lamed right the fuck off the face of the planet before I had the chance to reply to it, but remember that strip way back in ought-3 when Ray passed out in the hallway of Hotel Satan, or whatever, and a hell-flower leans out of the wallpaper to remind him of the time he quipped off-handedly, "Hey kid, no retard should pay to eat" and threw him a 20? This strip seems an articulation of previously alluded to, but rarely seen, super-rude Ray moments, like the retard thing. <br/> 
Incidently, I think I've seen similar situations in other comics; say, Calvin entertaining the idea of friendship with Suzie for a panel or two, realizing the impracticality of it, then "heh...no, though" and whack: snowball to the face. I'd like the last four panels to show up in Marmaduke: A five (unwieldy?) panel strip in which Marm's owner stands in silent reflection next to his dog for four panels then in the fifth, "heh...no, though" and puts one right through Marmaduke's huge fucking head.
