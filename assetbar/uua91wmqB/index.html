He has the ability to make us laugh just by making goofy faces. His best were when he was trapped in the bathroom behind the shower curtain when the real "Big Momma" (Ella Mitchell) was taking a dump a few feet away!

      I get the reference, but to me the tennis ball just makes it seem a bit like yuppie faux-dive. All with a sweater wrapped around his neck thinking how cute it is to be drinking from the bottle in the park. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For this person every day is a Saturday. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would perhaps use <br/> 
 <br/> 
[IMGS OFF] <br/> 
 <br/> 
instead. Maybe a bit too eye-catching, but what are you going to do? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps a compromise and we have a dog with a tennis ball in his mouth. His head cocked, looking askance at the viewer. One ear is flipped up quizzically. He does not understand, but, sadly, we do.

      Hey remember when everyone said that 90% of the  <em>Watchmen</em>  references were started by me? <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the past three strips I've said nothing about it and on each of these strips there have been at least one thread that references  <em>Watchmen</em> . <br/>

      I'm not a trained gun user, just a guy with an internet connection; so someone call me out here if I'm wrong. <br/> 
  Bullets generally do damage from being fast and sharp; they don't actually have much force behind them, since they're so small. When films show people being thrown back by being shot, they're being over-theatrical. It doesn't actually happen that much. <br/> 
  Significantly, due to conservation of momentum, any force the bullet does have, the gun will have the same force in the opposite direction. In fact, since a bullet uses a lot of its energy on piercing the target, the gun kicks back HARDER than the bullet. <br/> 
  Now, Ray is holding his gun sideways, a style that's known to be very rough on your elbows, especially if you don't know what you're doing, and Ray probably doesn't. If that bullet really does have that much force behind it, then Ray probably just badly broke his imaginary arm.

      "The gun kicks back harder than the bullet."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The reaction equals the initial action. But since the force of recoil for the shooter is spread over a much larger region, and before that it has to get through the inertia of the gun and/or any recoil compensation built into the gun, the recoil of a gun isn't going to be 'harder' than the force of impact a bullet makes. And the bullets don't necessarily expend lots of energy piercing a target - they spend most of it passing through.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, bullets don't do damange because they're sharp - their shape has more to do with aerodynamics than Fucking People Up. At the speed they're traveling, they could be shaped like little Rubik's Cubes and still do lots of damage; they'd just be much harder to fire accurately. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're right in that handgun rounds don't typically fling people through the air (that's what Ray's hands are for). As for Ray breaking his arm - you're going to sprain your hand/wrist way before you break your arm. And most handguns aren't powerful enough to seriously injure your arm just because you fire them like a gangsta. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Besides, Ray tore a dude's jaw off with his hands. I think he can handle all the action in this strip. Guy's strong. I mean, the rocket the trash bin was connected to? Didn't work. Just for show. Ray flexed and cold threw that bin into space.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And no, the recoil of that did not throw the Earth off its orbit.

      Having fired several types of handguns, shotguns, and rifles, I can verify your basic assumptions: a little piece of lead, no matter how fast it's going, isn't going to move a human body much.  Watch the WWII documentary footage of D-Day: people just drop when shot.  Also, explosions have gotten all out of control, as if bagel-sized hunks of C4 could bring down a building.  Oh, and real explosions aren't all orange and billowy -- that's more FX bullcrap.

      You guys, I don't know where else to ask this, so I'm just gonna ask it here. A little while back, was there a strip that was animated sort of? Like, not the whole thing, but there was one little part of it that was constantly moving? I don't know how else to explain what I mean. Like, the best example I can give would be that the whole strip was just a plain drawing as usual, but maybe there was a clock that was ticking in the background somewhere or something? It wasn't a clock, but that's just my way of explaining what I'm talking about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is a serious question. Because if that didn't happen, then it was a dream, and if I am dreaming about Achewood, then I think there is a problem.

      I did not mean the link to the strip that paperboy provided.  I mean that if you follow that link to achewood.com, and then click on the strip over there, it doesn't bring you back here.  It sends you to some website that sells geeky things.  Those links used to be sprinkled in the old Achewood, behind some of the strips, but they went away when AssetBar came along.  I'm trying to remember what other ones there used to be, so I can go and test them.

      Oh well that's a load of bull doohickey. Not that I particularly care about his physical presence - it's just that I'd feel cheated spending $20 to talk to him on AIM.

      huge slam by Achilleselbow on dinosaur comics out of nowhere.  I disagree.  I will admit that maybe you have to be half Vulcan to see the humor in Dinosaur Comics.  The characters are relentlessly introspective and analytical of various aspects of the human condition that everyone generally takes for granted.  Greed and self-doubt and ego and even technical stuff like the nature of time.  Ryan North is always pushing the envelope, mixing these themes up in new combinations in the same strip.  His work is not classical literature by any means.  Instead of working in the medium of the human experience as it is normally lived, North works in the medium of the human experience as it would probably be perceived by someone with some form of autism.  If you don't 'get it' or find it to be the least bit funny, that's okay.  You probably have to be a bit brain damaged to fully appreciate Dinosaur Comics.  That said, with record numbers of kids being diagnosed with ADD and Autism, with the exponentially collapsing information float, and with the amount of information and technology created by humans expanding at an exponential rate, it is only inevitable that people start exploring, as North does, purely abstract and esoteric concepts, and more to the point, exploring how the human psyche relates (often clumsily) with this flood of information and this new information-based world.  In a large sense, Dinosaur Comics is sort of a contemporary Huit Clos.  The premise of Dinosaur Comics is not unlike that of Huit Clos, with the added dimension, apparently in your case, that you feel as if you too are in hell along with the characters of the strip.  What a tour de force!

 <br/> 
okay... after reading it for the 10th time I finally understand what Glad is trying to say.  In response to Glad's statement, I say that hey, it's probably not so much a conspiracy as it is a result of how any free-market system works, right?  It's pretty basic non-equilibrium statistical phyiscs, right?  Since there is money in the proscribin of durgs, the system evolves towards a state where more durgs is prescribed.

      Amen gladi8 sayit again it the doctors watch too much TV and are too much friends with the pharmco sales reps who outnumber the doctors 3 to 1 and the doctors don't read much anymore so all they know is what the pharmco reps tell them.  with the overall health care system in tatters and all the money being stolen by the insurance companies, it is easy, too easy, to put some faith in a magic cure.  so instead of making real progress and doing real R&D and incorporating new technologies into medical practice (e.g., brain function scanning has been feasible for decades now, but psychiatrists still, for the most part, refuse to use it, preferring instead to play blindfolded Russian Roulette with their pills on your brain) and without the use of brain function scans psychiatry is at a standstill the only other way besides function scans that it can  <strike>improve</strike>   <em>regain the ground it has lost in the past couple decades</em> is if there was enough funding for people to get counseling by competent experienced counselors but all that money has been spent on the insurance companies and when you go to see the counselor it's like your therapist say 'okay your 2 minutes are up now I have to go spend 45 minutes on insurance company paperwork see you again next year' so we just keep investing more and more hope and more and more money into the magic pills.[IMGS OFF]

      Whether or not Dinosaur Comics is funny (jury's out), it is not a good comic. One can argue that it is well written, but any defense beyond that is doomed to ridiculousness.

      I agree and disagree with this statement. Dino Comix is a pretty well-written comic, but I think the word "funny" is subjective.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dinosaur Comics makes me laugh, but I can see how it wouldn't make other people laugh as well.

      I don't believe that it qualifies as a comic. A comic consists of writing and art. It is almost a comic. It is halfway there. Find a new term to describe what it is and then we can talk about its merits.

      It has writing. It has art. It just recycles the art. Do you also consider Red Meat not a comic? And I believe there is a term for it.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110102224601/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_comics">Constrained Comics</a>

      OK. Good. As long as we can agree that Dinosaur Comics is something other than a comic I have no problem with it. I'm sure it is a fine "constrained comic." Constrained comics just aren't my thing, I guess. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is the same argument I have with my girlfriend over Animal Collective. I'm sure they make fine....indie soundscapes, or whatever. But don't say that they make good songs. They do not make songs. Indie soundscapes just aren't my thing, I guess. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And gh, comparing Achewood to Dinosaur Comics only undermines your position. The former recycles many different images and often doesn't recycle them at all. Unlike the latter.  <em>Think about this.</em>

      It reminded me of  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110102224601/https://www.bookofratings.com/apartmentrules.html">an old Brunching Shuttlecocks piece</a>  where Lore rated various rules for his apartment complex. One of which was that you are not allowed to slam your fridge door. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have been compelled to slam refrigerator doors ever since reading that. How can I not? It haunts me.

      this is probably off topic...  but I wonder sometimes if different body types are more or less comfortable than other body types.  For instance, huge boobs could cause issues with the back.  That one is really obvious.  But are there other less obvious differences that might still be significant?  Like, might different shapes and configurations of sphincters and labia and vaginae be more or less comfortable?  For instance, some people sweat more than others.  What if you had a really sweaty asshole?  That would have to get irritating after a while.  People who suffer from gianticism (sp?) are another example.  Their bodies grow and grow and grow (usually because of a problem with the thyroid gland) and this results in permanent excruciating pain in joints and such.  But might there be more subtle differences?  For instance, when you wake up from sleeping in a really comfortable position, sometimes you are just damn comfortable.  This is partly a function of the mechanics of your body.  Smaller people must have an advantage in this one, because the tolerances for what constitutes proper support for the body and limbs would be proportional to their size and weight.  Look at pet kitty cats... they are comfortable sleeping in just about any damn position on just about any surface.  So this is what I am wondering about the human condition today. <br/>

      So today I realized that my mom is possibly more immature than I am. We were at a seder at this really posh apartment in Riverdale where everyone was all serious about observing the proper rituals and stuff, and both of us kept getting antsy and bored during the long Haggadah reading. Plus some people had Russian copies, but my mom only had an English copy and was struggling to make sense of the Biblical speech. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So at one point where it says that the heathens "devoured Jacob and laid waste to his dwelling" my mom asks me what devoured means. I tell her it means they ate him. After a long pause, she points to the second half of the sentence and asks me in one of those whispers that is completely audible to everyone in the room: "So does this mean that after they ate him they crapped in his house?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I burst out laughing. Then she burst out laughing. This was right in the middle of the reading. I don't think we'll be invited back.

      So I'm browsing the archives, and I noticed that some of the strips seem to have very reduced resolution.  I wonder is Onstad having the resolution of the archive reduced in order to lessen the harm done from piracy?  That way, pirated copies have less value, and the archive it's self has less value, thereby helping stuff like printed books of the archive maintain their value.  Not that I'm complaining.  It's Onstad's right to do that, and I support the idea of any artist being able to make a living off of their work. <br/>

      Achewood was hit pretty hard by the Great Pixel Shortage of  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110102224601/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/archive?start=20050201">February</a>  to  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110102224601/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/archive?start=20050708">July</a>  2005, forcing Onstad to reduce the resolution of the comic. Some webcomics chose to maintain their resolution by using cheap, low-quality pixels imported from Chinese pixel mines, leading to garish colours and generally shitty art. In  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110102224601/https://questionablecontent.net/">extreme cases</a> , the substandard pixels made it impossible to tell characters apart. It was a period of growth for Diesel Sweeties (which had always practised sustainable pixel farming) and Dinosaur Comics (which had been recycling pixels for years), but for many others they were dark, dark times.

      That was NeoGAF then. I'm usually fairly active in the Rock Band thread there. Fat Princess is going to be great. Of course, while everyone else was noticing how awesome it looked at E3 some angry fat girl decided that it had to be some sort of weird anti-fat, anti-woman sort of thing. Even though you're still rescuing the lard-ass princess, she just now weighs a ton and is hard to move.

      Her angry tirade was almost a parody of feminism. Especially the part where she failed to understand what she was being appalled by and went on to push for how it is actually a totally great and awesome thing for a person to choose to be fat. Aesthetics aside it is just plain unhealthy. I'm not saying that I'm at my ideal weight, but at least I'm not trying to defend it as being reasonable. <br/>

      Being overweight does not necessarily = being unhealthy.  <br/> 
By the way, as a less-than-perfect-looking girl/woman, I find her words on the topic very inspiring: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Being beautiful on the inside doesn't change the fact that it's still a radical act to look different and be happy in this culture. If you're obviously, undisguisably Less Than Perfect, you're not only meant to be unhappy, but deeply ashamed of yourself, projecting at all times an apologetic nature, indicative of your everlasting remorse for having wrought your monstrous self upon the world. You are certainly not meant to be bold, or assertive, or confident%u2014and should you manage to overcome the constant drumbeat of messages that you are ugly and unsexy and have earned equally society's disdain and your own self-hatred, should you forget your place and walk into the world one day with your head held high, you are to be reminded by the unsolicited comments and contemptuous looks of perfect strangers that you are not supposed to have self-esteem; you don't deserve it. Being publicly Less Than Perfect and happy is hard; being publicly, shamelessly, unshakably Less Than Perfect and happy is an act of both will and bravery." <br/>

      p.s. I would like to know where she said "everyone should take me seriously OR ELSE"? because as far as I can tell the blog consists of discussions of modern feminist issues, with some politics and silliness mixed in.

      i know this isn't my fight, but you seem to be intentionally missing the point. points of that post are provocative, didactic and polarizing, yes (such as calling non-feminist progressivism fauxgressivism), but the greater effort seems to be going to deconstructing chauvinistic responses to feminist rhetoric (often responses that are unconsciously so). case in point: belgand's initial response to her was to write her off as "some angry fat girl" and only engaged the ideas when pressed by howl.

It's not really a classic moment and the song only loosely makes sense to the strip which, in all fairness, isn't even commenting on the issues of the song itself, but using the phrase in a different direction to refer to the deep economic divide in this state.

      many people browse through indexes of books (and sex toys) that are dynamically created by running searches and browsing rankings.  If you remove a book from all searches except those which specify the title of the book exactly, it's like the book doesn't exist!  It's like wikipedia without links to other articles!  How many times have you been browsing on Wikipedia and a couple of clicks later you find yourself reading a completely unrelated article about  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110102224601/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexual_behaviour#Bottlenose_Dolphins"><strong>Dolphin Sex</strong></a> .

      Yeah I was just thinking the same thing just now (except for the part about the anal sex)  Hypodermically speaking, if a site like Amazon does set up a user rating system that lets users  <em>ignore</em>  certain books, then a user could script-bomb the system to get specific books de-listed, but more likely, you'll just get a bunch of ignorant Americans who each independently  <em>lame</em>  and  <em>ignore</em>  any sort of book that has to do with concepts about  <em>sex</em>  or  <em>women as people</em>  until those books are delisted by the system.  Meanwhile your highest rated books will be stuff about how being Gay is a curable disease.  Like if you search for 'homosexuality' on amazon.com the first result returned is:   <em>A Parent's Guide to Preventing Homosexuality</em> .  Seriously.  wtf.

      what's wrong with one's offspring bein' gay?  I will grant you that there are more challenges in life for someone who is gay, such as prejudices, and no one wants their kid to have to suffer prejudices, but, hey, the world's a bitch, if you don't want your kid to suffer then you probably shouldn't be having a kid in the first place.  And if you're seriously considerin' the in-all-likelyhood-futile endeavor of altering the natural development of your kid's _sexual orientation_ then, wow, where do you draw the line?  It seems a little anal if you ask me, to be molding and custom designing one's kid's very existence.  But then again, I guess, yeah, why the hell not try to control who and what your kid is and thinks and believes.  Control the kid down to training his/her very reflexes!  (maybe hypnosis will help for that) Especially if you're already [insert fanatical cult-like strain of Christianity here]  I hear they go for that.

      i don't know granular s. that was verging on a trolling kind of question but I couldn't help myself.  okay, if I had the option, I guess I would need to know what the protocol entails, really.  Does it involve beating the gay or straight out of the kid?  That's a pretty straight-forward approach that I think most parents could handle, but if it's gonna involve sophisticated psycho-babbly chicannery I dunno if I would have the stomach (nor the insurance coverage) for that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I personally think it totally depends on the person if it's an option or not.  There are probably lots of gay people who mistakenly think they are straight, and lots of straight people who mistakenly think they are gay, but they arrived at a mistaken understanding of their own sexual orientation due to some nuance in how their psychology and self-awareness developed... had it developed just a little bit differently, they might have pursued different identities.  Okay, when I say lots, I mean only numerically lots; I am sure that the vast majority of us are not confused about our sesual identity, but shit, I guess when it comes to raising one's kids, you don't wanna take chances, if you're really hoping for an outcome one way or the other....  hmmm....  maybe I should write a book...  I could buy "A Parent's Guide to Preventing Homosexuality" and just crib from it, rewriting all the advice in opposite form, telling the parent to do the exact opposite... that should result in a gay kid, right?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
anyway, more seriously, I would guess that of the minority of people who get confused about their sexual identity, the biggest factors would have to be the wacky ideas that society and religion teaches people... followed by mental illness.  I guess since kids are basically raised by TV now a days, theoretically the TV could make your kid gay or straight.  And let's not forget porn...  I mean, whacking off to porn, gay or straight, really tends, I think, to re-enforce your concept of your sexual identity, right?  I mean, back in the day, right, porn was pretty soft-core and maybe consisted for a lot of kids of just the Macy's catalog...  but I mean, this stuff they have now of the fully interactive DVD surround sound home theater imax complete with smell-a-vision, not to mention the mundane erotic and pronographic ipod and iphone screen savers that are now just, well, mundane, whereas 50 years ago you could have gotten arrested for them.  I think, in this day and age, with all the mostly straight porn oozing out of the intertubes out of one's monitor and spilling out onto the keyboard, if your kid, despite all that, says he/she's gay, then, yeah, your kid probably is.  Am I white or am I white!

      Ok, it is possible that I am just incredibly immature, but does anyone else find that article absolutely hysterical? <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Flatworms "fence" using two-headed dagger-like penises which are pointed, and white in color. The "winner" is the organism that inseminates the other. The sperm is absorbed through pores in the skin, causing fertilization in the "loser" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Seahorses, long upheld as monogamous and mating for life, are identified as "promiscuous, flighty, and more than a little bit gay" according to research" <br/>

I mean if those two sentences didn't make you laugh than maybe this one will: <br/>

"black swans of Australia form sexually active male-male mated pairs and steal nests" <br/>

      <strong>With all this hate, mindless BS, I thought I would share something nice. I'm a beautiful black female and my love, a beautiful white man just made love to me for hours upon hours. It was amazing, blissful, I was melting, and he kissed me over and over and told me how much he loved me, and we just came all over each other. I actually feel renewed. And no it isn't something that is going away, we have been with each other for almost four years, and it is still amazing.<br/>

STOP focusing on each other's difference, and getting sidetracked with race, color, etc. We are all in this together, man &amp; woman. Spread love, and your world will expand with positivity</strong> <br/>
