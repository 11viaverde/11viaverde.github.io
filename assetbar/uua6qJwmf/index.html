      Depends. If you're in one of those giant rural areas near Morganton or Greenville or something like that, I could see it being a little depressing, but if you're anywhere around the Triad/Triangle/Charlotte centers, for my money it's one of the greatest places in the US. Good weather, mountains and the beaches right nearby, thriving culture and some sports teams that do just well enough to be called mediocre. <br/>

It just occurred to me, though, that you could be talking about South Carolina. In which case, God have mercy on your soul. <br/>

      Hold it right there!!!  Back away from the computer!  We need to do a reality check right now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
OK, my roots go very deep in North Carolina.  Great Grandpappy, 11 great aunts and uncles, and all.  BUT, let's get one thing perfectly clear: they may call it BBQ, but it's not!  Not even close.  (Might as well be) boiled pig meat with (looks and tastes like) watery marinade ladled on top (Huh?! WTF is this?) does NOT equal BBQ.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Texas?  No, sorry. That, at least, tastes like BBQ, but, the best?  Not by a mile.  Not by a Texas mile.  You want good Q?  Well, Daddy Bruce's is closed now.  A sad thing.  So Denver is out.  Flint's and some others in the East Bay are pretty damn good, still...  Maybe one of Daddy's cousins in Arkansas, but I wouldn't know where to send you.  That pretty much leaves good old Kansas City.  Now  <em>that</em>  is BBQ! <br/>

      When it comes to American BBQ, you have four basic styles <br/> 
 <br/> 
Texas: Beef, beef, and more beef, usually large cuts such as the brisket, typically with rich, spicy sauces rather than the sweeter sauces you find around KC. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kansas City: While other cuts of meat are cooked, KC is mostly about ribs.  Cooked until they are falling apart and smothered in sweet, sticky sauces. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Memphis: like KC, it's all about the ribs, but they typically don't mess around with all that sauce business.  Memphis barbecue tends to favor dry rubs, and when a sauce is used, it's usually much lighter than what you'd find in KC. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Carolina: Carolina barbecue is also about pork, but not so much ribs as larger cuts like the shoulder.  Carolina barbecue characteristically features thin, vinegar-based sauces, as opposed to the thick sauces most people think of when you say barbecue, but it is no less delicious than the other varieties.  I'll take a well made pulled pork sandwich over a rack of ribs any day of the week. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Whatever style you favor, however, I think everyone can agree that ,on a hot summer day, a nice plate of barbecue, with a big scoop of potato salad and an ice-cold beer is the best possible earthly approximation of what heaven might be like.  Rather than remaining divided into factions, we should unite in our common love of delicious slow-cooked meats. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, in case this comes up at any future point in the discussion, anything cooked on a gas grill does NOT count as barbecue.  Gas grills are sacrilegious, all true barbecue is cooked with charcoal and wood chips, and anyone who tells you differently is not someone you should associate with.

      Mmmmmm, great descriptions.  I tend to favor the Memphis style, which is also available in Chi-town.  But I agree that slow-cooked meat cooked over a smokey fire is what we're talking about, and it's all good.

      I feel like you've left something out with your barbecue descriptions. None of those come close to what I've had while in Alabama and Georgia. This could just be misguided, regionally-centered parochialism, but I think there are some differences worth bringing to light here. In Alabama and Georgia you get your chicken and pork as your lead meats, while ribs can take a back seat at some resturants. The sauces are generally thick and dark, sometimes heavy on pepper or another spice that ups the heat factor. The other thing you may get, usually as a secondary choice is "white sauce," which is a mayonnaise-based sauce that is either sublime or disgusting depending on how it was prepared and who you are asking.   <br/> 
If you are ever in Alabama do yourself a favor and visit a "Dreamland" Barbecue in Huntsville, Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, or Montgomery. If you're ever in metro Atlanta, go for Williamson Bros., they have the best sauce I've ever had. <br/> 
Then again, I was born in Florida, so I probably know fuck all about real barbecue.

I'm assuming that's sarcasm, right?  Because if you think Chapel Hilll is a "soulless waste of concrete," you need to travel more. <br/>

      It's not like death is that big an obstacle to Ray, Roast Beef, Todd, Molly, Teodor, Blister... pretty much everyone except Leo Fontanette. And who knows, he might show up eventually too. <br/> 
 <br/>

 <br/> 
1.  No one drives under 88 miles per hour, nor shall anywhere we go need "roads". <br/> 
2.  Bustin' makes us feel good. <br/> 
3.  No snakes, and by extension no pits full of them.  Why does it have to be snakes? <br/> 
4.  Pain don't hurt, and if a man pulls a gun on you, you have no choice but to fucking rip his throat out, even if it makes you sad. <br/> 
5.  Everyone gets a machine gun and shoes that fit properly, in case of terrorists and broken glass. <br/> 
6.  All teenage boys will log no less than thirty-six (36) hours in Navigator flight simulator.   <br/> 
7.  All robots  <em>must</em>  be jive-talking. <br/> 
8.   <strong>DOOOO BOWP BOWP</strong>   <em>Chicka-chikaaaaaah.</em>

      GH3 turned me on to Fall of Troy. I quickly concluded that (a) every song on that album sounds almost exactly like every other song, and (b) FCPREMIX is pretty clearly the best of them. I like the first, maybe, six tracks? But once you get to that breakdown bit in Laces Out, Dan, you're just thinking "urgh, what are you  <em>doing</em> " and don't stop thinking it until the album is over.

      I wouldn't really call Doppelganger an album. Most of the songs were re-recordings of tracks from the debut, and they overproduced them to hell, and yea there was just too much noise wankery towards the end. <br/>

i think this is because i just went and saw their headlining tour a month or so ago and i was about 10 years above the average age.  why do i have the musical taste of high school sophomore?  dammit.

      Man, don't be ashamed of liking music with angst, power chords, and screaming. The Pitchfork-type condescension towards that is but a newly disguised incarnation of "damn kids, your music is too angry and loud!" There'll be plenty of time to like acoustic folk rock when you're old.

      haha, yeah, i don't know if that is why pitchfork doesn't like the whole post-hardcore thing...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i like pitchfork for the most part too though.  (basically i don't get into not liking things - i don't know what this says about me.)   <br/> 
 <br/> 
basically someone out there will mock you for liking anything.  so just listen to what  <strike>makes you popular</strike>  you like.

      Fun fact - Jessica is better known the UK as the theme song to Top Gear. If Nice Pete ever wants to write a Jeremy Clarkson autobiography, he'd better remember that Clarkson will have built up an immunity to it. Then again, if I'd managed to get Jeremy to a remote forest, drunk and hypnotised, I'd drive away as fast as possible rather than listen to him ramble on about his early life.

the plot of every one of his movies is "woody alan has sex with women who are too good-looking for him." <br/> 
 <br/> 
sooo.. boo to <i>everything you ever wanted to know about sex.</i>

      The nature of plot is to unveil information to the audience piece by piece in a planned manner so as to imbue that information with drama and create sympathy for the characters as extensions of our own experience.  Yes, Lost has faltered on a few occasions, but for the vast majority of its run has been the most exiting show on television. You try getting a TV network to produce anything as bizarre and complicated as Lost, and then tell me about what good TV is.   <br/>

      Ray totally reminds of this guy in college who was into hip-hop.  Whenever we'd talk about going to see a rock show, he'd say, "Naw, I can't get into that rock-a-billy crap".  Anything with guitars was rock-a-billy.  He referred to  <em>Led Zeppelin</em>  as rock-a-billy.

      no they are not rock-a-billy.  Rock-a-billy is a very specific form of early rock n' roll that blends elements of country and swing.  THIS IS NOT WHAT LED ZEPPLIN DOES, hence cabin boy's italics.

      I was in a class last quarter in which we made a graphic novel about the phenomenon of acid attacks on women in Cambodia, and we indicted a bunch of corrupt government officials, and now the book is all getting thousands of hits on the int0r wabs and getting written up in a bunch of newspapers and magazines and blogs, and I am really genuinely scared that someone is going to come to my house and throw acid in my face. This is a fear I don't get to bring up in conversation very often, because people don't talk about throwing acid at people very often. In conclusion: yearsinhotclaws, please do not turn out to be a Cambodian hitman, as it will put a strain on our relationship and on the details of my facial features.

      The girl who set up the website said it had something to do with making it slightly harder to alter/parody?

      Honestly, I think it's more 'homoerotic' or whatever to constantly harp on that. People think they're oh-so-clever when they point this out about movies like 300 or Troy, not realizing that their snippy comments are moot because the glorification of the male body WAS in fact a large part of the Hellenic culture those movies are portraying. <br/>

      No, I didn't realise that, and yes, you are a dick for pointing it out. The film was not made in Hellenistic times. It was made in 2006. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As a red-blooded gay man, I can say that I enjoyed the film for both its rampant violence and proficient use of man-candy.

      I actually thought 300 was paradoxically homophobic in addition to being homoerotic. The Spartans all making fun of the Athenians for being "boy-lovers," Xerxes all creepily trying to give Leonidas a backrub. The politics were pretty problematic in that movie all around. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I enjoyed the man-candy!

      Yea, the "boy-lovers" thing was a silly inaccuracy. It was somehow meant to suggest Athenian decadence versus Spartan discipline. The rest of the politics have been debated way too much, so I'll just say that the whole Iran connection was moot because the comic was written years ago and the exaggerations and inaccuracies are largely drawn from sources like Herodotus. As for the larger politics, Zizek (who totally blew my mind when I saw him speak here last semester) had a very interesting reverse  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090905035224/https://www.lacan.com/zizhollywood.htm">take</a>  on it where he saw Persia as the hegemonic power.

      That is a really interesting take, and I think I would be more inclined to buy it fully if it weren't for the fact that the Spartans are white and the Persians are not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will say, though, in defense of the movie's politics, that it greatly expanded the role of Leonidas's wife (the only female character, if I remember correctly) from the bit part she had in the comic. Not that the expansion was entirely without problems, but I thought it was a positive, feminist-friendly development overall.

      Why has no one mentioned that despite the visual quality of the film, (which was stunning, and I can only hope that after this and  <em>Sin City</em>  more comic book adaptations try to emulate the art in the books) this movie was basically pretty sucky? Maybe I need to hand in my penis, but the acting was pretty awful and I could not give two shits about any character on screen. I found this film boring, boring, boring. Also pretty dumb. Dumb and Boring and Crappy, so not worth talking about. Also I will give you a chubby for mentioning feminism, because I can.

I think it is commendable that you find that sort of thing boring. I am very easily excited by battle scenes, and I think this is a quality that makes me of low mind. I even like battle scenes where the dudes aren't all naked and oiled up, although that certainly doesn't hurt.

      Okay I should probably say that I might need to go hand in my penis as well because I also noticed the flaws you describe, though I didn't think they were that important. I think the main problem was that terse one-sentence-per-panel comic book dialogue and narration doesn't really work when transplanted word-for-word into a movie. On the page it has a certain level of stylized detachment, but when you see and hear an actor speak the lines, you can't help but take them completely seriously. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But it's unfortunate that people have this expectation that all films or books have to be psychological and present realistic characters that you identify with, because that's a fairly recent idea that came about with the rise of the novel. The dialogue in The Iliad isn't realistic either, nor are the characters what we would call "three-dimensional" - rather they embody certain archetypes and ideals. I think that's what 300 was going for, but obviously it could have been better written. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Regardless, the visual quality and the battle scenes were worth it alone. I think that people who can't derive some sort of primal satisfaction out of representations of gratuitous stylized violence are really missing out.

      So You guys are the two people that saw  <em>Shoot em Up</em> ? It didn't even make it into Cinemas in Australia. I like stylized violence too, but Gerard Butler shouting ridiculous nonsense really turned me off 300. For violence I liked  <em>Sin City</em> , Dario Argento,  <em>Mad Max 2</em>  aka  <em>Road Warrior</em> , but in particular I liked the violence in  <em>A History of Violence</em> ,  <em>No Country For Old Men</em> , and  <em>Eastern Promises</em> . Gratuitous but also chillingly real, 300 pales into insignificance when hit by the highbeams of brilliant film making. I am most looking forward to the film version of  <em>The Road</em>  that is currently in production. That will be a wonderfully godawful violent nightmare of a film, I may well puke in anticipation when Viggo starts to bash open that cellar door.  <strong>Fuck I'm freaking myself out as I type this!</strong>

      In fairness, it could just be that you were lamed because the lamer disagrees with your opinion either on the appropriateness of the treatment of that character, or your interpretation of the meaning of the persians' skin colour.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, given that Greeks are actually pretty white (and more so before the Turkish invasion, as far as anyone can tell), and the persians probably would not have been classified as "white" in American culture, it is probably not a point well made.

      Is that true? I feel like the Greeks and the Persians/Iranians I've met have mainly been approximately the same shade of tan, but perhaps I haven't met an adequate sample size. I know for sure that I have definitely never seen a Persian dude as black as the messenger guy who gets kicked into the pit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, it's nice of you to actually voice your disagreement instead of just laming me. I'm not sure whoever lamed me had the same disagreement as you did, because it was (presumably) the same person that lamed me a few posts earlier for saying I thought the movie was homophobic.

      I might as well chime in here again: I'm half Tajik, which is a subset of the Persian ethnicity and I've never been perceived as anything other than white, though people have told me I do look somewhat 'eastern'. And judging from the two Persians I've known in real life as well as the ones in popular media like ol' Mahmoud, they're pretty damn white. I think people assume they're not because they're Middle Eastern, but they're about as light-skinned as the average European, just with different features. So 300 was way wrong on that count. Keep in mind, they did present Persia as an empire spanning all of Northern Africa, but it still doesn't make sense that Xerxes would be black.

      The Persian Army contained Ethiopian contingents, egyptian ones and even Indian soldiers, but its doubtfull that the emperor would be some 8ft Brazillian guy, more likely he was just another chap from the middle east with a ringletted Beard style and a liking for silk trousers.

      Well said.  I went and saw the movie, knowing I'd hate it, just because I've read quite a bit about this period in history.  I also like film a lot, and I'm completely down with the fact that historical accuracy is not necessary for a good movie, but jesus that movie bugged the shit out of me mainly just for that reason.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It seemed like the more Persian you got, the darker skinned you got.  It's not really a creative interpretation, it's just stylistic immaturity (which, to me, seems to be a problem rampant in comic book culture).  Basically, a tall, androgynous black guy seemed "cooler."   <br/>

      Herodotus exaggerates the numbers of the persians sure, but he doesnt paint such a bizarrely xenophobic view as Miller does. Herodotus portrays the Persians sympathetically in many instances, Xerxes weeping at the transience of human life when he witnesses his army assembled for example, is a particularly touching moment. Or the courage displayed by individuals such as Mardonius.  <br/>

He also doesnt mention any bloody "Battle Rhinoes"

      no-one thinks it is clever to point this out about these films, it is an obvious component of their style. everyone knows that glorification of the male body and way homoerotic art was totally a thing for greek dudes. what i  <em>don't</em>  understand is the "you're out of the man club if you dont think 300 was awesome" type thing. 300 just seems like strangely homoerotic thing for the the man club to embrace, regardless of the appropriateness of said homoeroticism.

      Well, assuming contrary to Freud that people can have interests other than sexual ones, 'manliness' here is implied in a broader sense of violence, heroism, etc., which is how it was defined in the old times by dudes who also thought it was okay to give other men kisses. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem is that while I don't believe in essentialist gender categories, the word 'manliness' does actually stand for something like the ideal/aesthetic of heroic virtue. And I think a lot of feminists and sensitive progressive types make the mistake of rejecting and ridiculing that aesthetic ideal completely, when all they should be rejecting is the word and the implication that such an ideal only belongs to men. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So anyway, it was a joke in a webcomic and obviously I don't think you're not a 'real man' if you didn't like 300 (because there's no such thing as a 'real man' anyway), but I do think it's kind of sad if people have conditioned themselves to not enjoy typically 'male' things because of gender politics or sloppy Freudian interpretations.

      I just read it and it was wonderful.  Very high quality stuff.  I liked how she imagined the American freeway as having bikers on it.  Knowing someone was going to be Harvey Dented from the outset made it very tense to read.  I feel like kind of an ass for joking about it now.  I'm guessing you were Lauren O.?  I would be very proud to be a part of something that good.

      "Cyclists" and "bikers" mean the same thing to me. "Bikers" can also mean folks on motorcycles, but there was nothing wrong with your original statement, including your assessment of my name. And hey, um, thanks for saying nice things and stuff, you ain't obligated to do that.

      I haven't been able to read loneal's project yet (my browser sputtered for half an hour before spitting out a blank pair of pages numbered "NaN"), but I'm way on board with her fear and loathing of thugs bearing acid. This was my way of filling the Photoshop void so that no one would feel a need to illustrate anything remotely acid-burn related. <br/>

      Poteen, or poitin, is pronounced Po-CHEEN, accent on the second syllable.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now learned men who use the pen <br/> 
Have wrote the praises high; <br/> 
Of the sweet poitin from Ireland green, <br/> 
Distilled with wheat and rye. <br/> 
Forget your pills,it will cure all ills <br/> 
Of the Pagan, Christian or Jew, <br/> 
Take off your coat and grease your throat <br/> 
With the rare old mountain dew.

      Is it just me, or does every national anthem suck big floppy donkey dick?  At least they're mostly fairly short (not counting the second verses like in Advance Australia Fair, which nobody would know), and some end well (Star Spangled Banner),  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090905035224/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_national_anthem">but I sure feel sorry for the Greeks</a> , who have the world record for longest national anthem. <br/>

      In breaking news, an attack has been made on the United Nation Secretary General. Shortly after a meeting of the UN general Assembly, in which the New National Anthem for all Nations Resolution was passed, the Secretary General was subject to a fatal attack. Security images show that the head of the secretary general seemed to explode, seemingly through no outside influence. <br/>

      So this is the tale of our poetess, <br/> 
And her posthumous renown -- <br/> 
She never could land a husband, <br/> 
But she sure could sling a noun. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Death held a grave mystique for her; <br/> 
She loved that endless night -- <br/> 
She might've been called the first goth, <br/> 
If she hadn't worn mostly white. <br/> 
 <br/> 
No phone! No fax! No internet! <br/> 
Nor guests for company -- <br/> 
Like Thomas Ruggles Pynchon, <br/> 
She was insular as could be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So open up a tome, my friend, <br/> 
And find yourself immersed -- <br/> 
With Emily, <br/> 
The Reaper too; <br/> 
A feathered thing, <br/> 
And a snake -- <br/> 
Two nobodies, <br/> 
plus a mushroom-elf <br/> 
and God Himself -- <br/> 
Here, in Dickinson's verse!

      <em>'Twas like where you're from weren't never there. Where you're going doesn't matter. And where you are ain't no good unless you can get away from it.</em> <br/> 
Ministry used this and the justified^^ sample^^ in the   <em>Red Line/White Line</em>  edit of  <em>Jesus Built My Hotrod</em>  which I got into because Gibby Haynes was the vocalist. I was a huge Butthole Surfers fan, so in a way the Butthole Surfers turned me onto Southern Gothic literature, including Faulkner, preparing me for Barton Fink two years later, and English Lit at university two years after that. And my parents said it was just noise, Pfffffft!
