      I actually met Donovan at a show in Omaha one time.  He was only like five feet tall and most of that was hair.  He was drinking a Heineken and being a total douchebag.

Afterwards, we yelled at him across the bar "Sorry about 'Don't Look Back', it made you look like a jerk!"

      Is that Beastie Boys lyric a reference to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in any way? I ask because Mr. Bungle has a song called Squeeze Me Macaroni, and there's been a feud between Mr. Bungle singer Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis for maybe almost 20 years now. <br/>

      No, it's a reference to his own wife.  <br/>

Kiedis' feud is with Patton 'stealing his schtick' even though everyone in the late eighties stamped around with long hair.

      Okay, people? David Blaine is not just an idiot. He is also a magician/illusionist and he is actually very, very good. Ignore all his stupid stunts, watch his television show. I'm talking about stuff like: he asks someone to think of someone they love, really hard, then pulls up his sleeve and there is a tattoo of their face on his arm. I don't know how he does it, but damn it is impressive.

People like going to magic shows because they are  <em>interesting</em>  and  <em>fun to watch</em> . A dude sitting in a tank of water is neither of those things.

      Hey FP, that sort of thing will probably never stop, since us guys can theoretically impregnate a women until they day of our death (or after with frozen sperm) it's hard to ever know if we're done, if this is the last one, if we should settle down.  I'm settling, BTW, but only after multiple fuckups.

This has never been a strip as easily defined or pigeonholed as "Action" or any such. The dialog, with its quirks and odd usages has always been much more the thing, which shows up in the comments here as constant quotes from former strips.  <br/>

I laughed outloud at work reading this one, and the alttext sealed the deal. Solid Gold, 5 (since there is no higher) exactly-the-reason-I-stay-tuned-in Achewood. <br/>

You are welcome to disagree!

      Lechatbotte, you are okay. I just hope you realize that most of our generation, especially the Internet-dwelling portion is far too cynical and jaded to be moved by your inspirational speeches, your appeals to common humanity, or your cute cat impersonations. We have spent far too much time looking at pictures of distended anuses and being tricked into watching Rick Astley videos. There is no hope.

      Cynicism and resignation are not specific to any generation! They are as old as language itself. I think they were the first two words of Sumerian that were translated. (I made that up.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is ALWAYS counterintuitive to speak of things actually making a difference, or being what they seem. You  <em>want</em>  to be moved. I hear it! But you don't trust it. I will land flat on some of the readership, but who knows who may be brought alive, if only enough to hope for the possibility of possibility? <br/> 
 <br/> 
The machinery of being human is designed for one purpose only: Survival. This we are expert at! How do I know? 'Cause we're all here! Cynacism and resignation are good for surviving life. But if you ever want to  <em>really</em>  live, you gotta give 'em up! And I don't care what your age or technological awareness, that ain't normal for a human to do! But it is the only door available to go from surviving life to thriving and living life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have commited my life to bringing this about for everyone I can. Commitments like that call me to choose against the resigned asshole I otherwise would be, and make a difference. There only is no hope when you say so. Good news, you can always say differently.

I believe in all of you, including AIU. And I am fully self-expressed. So I will decline your request, and talk to him whenever I feel inclined. It is my hope that it  <em>will</em>  make him stronger (something I think we'd all pull for if we got what that really entailed). But thank you for asking. <br/>

Let me opportune this communication to acknowledge you for some of the brilliance I have seen you generate in the short time you have been back. It has been a wonder to behold. I can see how clearly you were missed while not internetable. Thank you!

      Hey y'all. Heard my name being mispronounced. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, if I get ya' straight, guitarhero buddy, you're saying that what you don't get must be stupid? And that you will get me to heel with threats of being ignored? Man, I sure remember being young and thinking I knew it all! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now I'm older, I really get that I don't know much, and that knowing really isn't a very powerful place to be. I hope you'll try "getting" this next part (not understanding it, just "getting it). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Trolls is trolls. And they can be found in the same place as cats in boots.  <strong>Story books!</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
But this is not a story book! This is your one and only life. Every moment is precious. None of them come back again. Every time you dehumanize another human being to  <em>any</em>  degree, you destroy workability for yourself now, and into the future. What does it mean? Just more and more things on your list of what you want in life get pushed further and further away from today, and closer and closer to that "someday" that comes two days after you're pushing up daisies. You really don't have time for it! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I'm not here to change anything, or anyone. The more you change things, the more they haven't really changed. I'm here to have a conversation. In the end, the only two things that we ever really have in life are the eternal millisecond that is "right now" and the conversations we fill those "nows" with. There is  <em>nothing</em>  else! <br/> 
 <br/> 
And these words we use have power like we don't even begin to realize sometimes. When you say, "Troll!", you create something. Then you resist it, and it gains power and persists. When I say, "No, human being.", then I create something else. Then I accept him just the ways he is and just the ways he ain't.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, one of two things will happen. If he really is a human being who  <em>wants</em>  to shock, terrorize, cause fear, feel all powerful and cool because of what he can do here, he ain't going to get what he needs from being accepted and loved. He will leave. A feared and ignored "troll" is much more powerful than a loved and accepted misbehavin' youth! <br/> 
 <br/> 
But if instead he is (and I believe this to be so) a young man dealing with what it is to be human in the best ways he knows how, treating him with love and respect will inspire him to live up being "human", instead of down to being a "troll". Chubbies and lames, a gentle nudge ("That was a bit over the line."), honest requests ("please don't do that anymore.") - we can't help but see more of the brilliance that he possess, and less of the bored playing around to see what will happen. But this only works if he is sincerely accepted and loved! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Either way, he wins, the community wins, life itself wins. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know your smart, Guitarhero. I've read your posts. I get why a lot of this may sound like hoowie. It sure don't jive with what the world's been teaching ya'! Just try it on. You don't have to believe it, or accept it or anything. Just try it. It either works, or it don't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Authentically: if you ignore me into the JIA, and all the people I love here turn their back on me, it really wouldn't arrive for me as a harm. I'm still in the conversation, even if all I can do is be the listener. And I'll still leave cat paw prints all over the place so that if anyone ever unignores me, they can have a laugh. Who I am doesn't require you to hear it for me to be it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Invidious has made an assessment of what a real troll would be like. No human being is made of such stuff. You give away too much power when you make someone a troll. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nice-on-water thinks I'm just optimistic. There is some of that, but really, I'm not being optimistic about any of you. I just see you differently then you see yourselves. It is not optimistically. It is who you  <em>really</em>  are. And who I  <em>really</em>  am. If you choose to see what I see, you can not help but be what I am.

      I'm not going to get into the LCB debate (not a troll, just wordy), but I wanted to point out that little buddy-pal-friend-etc thing is NOT a South Park thing by origin.  It greatly predates South Park.  It is classic.  It is welcome.  It just needs to be set up better than up above.

      The pocket all bursting on one end, the cheese running out into a congealed pool on the plate.  You know the pocket will be dry on the inside and you think "Should I just eat the cheese?  What does that make me if I peel the cheese off and eat it?  Who am I?"   <br/>

      Actually I would just inspect it at eye-level for a few seconds then slide the whole thing out of the pocket, into my mouth in one piece, feel the intense heat, run around the kitchen screaming, then when it finally cools I chew it 3 or 4 times then swallow it all in one huge biley chunk of pepperoni, mozzarella, and crispy crusty tender flaky crust.   <br/>

      Actually although AIU has hella trolled in the past, as Garcon he wasn't really trolling, he was ranting. The difference being that he isn't just trying to get a rise out of you, he is saying what he thinks about a subject (albeit aggressively). Auto-ignore did an excellent job of preventing the board being spammed to shit, but I don't like that I have to unignore garcon manually because everyone reflexively ignores him (although it is certainly a price I'm willing to pay, since the only reason he chilled out is thanks to auto-ignore). <br/>

      I hate to agree with him, but he has a point, though a horribly made one. This may not be the place for a political discussion, but appending "God Bless America" to "respect for those who died" every time someone mentions 9/11 is already a political move, even if it's an unintentional one. We can all agree that it is a bad thing that those 3000 people died, not because they were Americans, but because they were people. To attempt to tie that sentiment to some sort of religiously-tinged patriotism is offensive both to the memory of the dead and to the people that would still like to pretend we don't live in a theocracy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
America neither rocks or sucks. Like most other countries, it is an arbitrarily bounded territory of land where a bunch of completely different and unrelated people and groups live under a common ruling body. You can have opinions on the government, the people, or perhaps the Constitution, but "America" as a whole is a fake idea.

      This is true, but I myself wasn't trying to tie that in religiously.  I just think that America is overall a good country, and I would rather live here than any other country.  I like more things about America than I hate. <br/> 
Also, I was just trying to annoy garcon. <br/> 
I am an atheist, by the way, and I never say "God Bless"  <em>anything</em> .  And Christian fundamentals who say that God is on our side annoy me too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You think that America is a granfalloon, and I guess I agree with you.  But as a place, and a government, it is good enough for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Garcon views me as a jingoistic red-necked moron who holds positive feelings for something for no good reason.  But just because I didn't give a reason why I like America doesn't actually mean I have no good reason.  Garcon is simply assuming I'm a moron. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My point is that I feel like I mischaracterized myself, and my feelings towards America are pro, and garcon needs to learn how to deal with people better. <br/>

      Yea, it's kind of funny. For a lot of us who are dissatisfied with things about America, it's purely an ideological matter. It horrifies me to think about the war, Guantanamo, hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqi civilians, tax dollars being used to overthrow democratically elected rulers in Latin America and elsewhere, and the people who want to ban evolution along with abortion and stem cell research. But all it does is horrify me. I don't have friends or family in the military or in Iraq, and my field of work is somewhat insulated from the dismal economy. Despite my best efforts, I have yet to knock anyone up, and if I do have kids they probably won't be going to school in Kansas. So yea, for my immediate life, America's a pretty good place and I appreciate that. I just know there are a lot more people both inside and outside the country for whom America's policies haven't been so great, and this is what bothers me. If only I could learn to be completely apathetic.

      You have it a little backwards,  <em>my friend</em> . All I've done is state my opinions in as nuanced and rational a manner as I could. I made no assumptions about your views or anyone else's -  <em>you are not a part of my cartoon show</em> ! But of course you simply glaze over what I say, because you already decided long ago that I fit into your general archetype of those brainwashed hippies you have spent much of your life disdaining and whom you think you have completely figured out. You're right on man, I'm just another silly leftist brainwashed by academia. Hey, did you know that we like to sit at Starbucks and wear Che Guevara shirts that we bought for $20 while ranting about the evils of capitalism? Oh and we all totally worship Obama like he's some kind of god even though we hate religion? Isn't that hilarious? It's like...it's like we all think we're nonconformists, but we're conforming to each other!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But not you, no. You're much too smart for this, and I'm sure you love making these very original and clever critique on those right-wing blogs with flippantly cynical names that you sometimes visit. Oh yes, we're just a bunch of silly youth following a fad. And because you are older and therefore have an infinitely more wise and non-cartoonish view of the world - the kind that comes not from any particular knowledge but good ol' fashioned  <em>experience</em>  -  it's not even worth it for you to make a logical rebuttal to any one of my points. Rather, you will just sit back from the keyboard with a wry smile and chuckle at my naivete. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Feels pretty good to be you, doesn't it Dave?

      My feeling for a long time has been that everyone needs "someone" to look down his or her nose at.  I figured out recently that mine is "Disaffected Youth."  So, full marks for perspicacity. <br/>

      I like to alternate. The Bible-thumping, flag-waving, pro-war rednecks are too easy of a target, though that doesn't make their existence any less real or the fact that they vote any less scary. Then you have the basic knee-jerk hippie liberals who embrace a whole slew of contradictory positions, such as being for women's rights but unwilling to criticize other cultures where they are not valued, being for illegal immigration but against the corporations that thrive on it, and disliking organized religion but embracing the latest eastern spirituality fad, all this combined with a misguided optimism and faith in "the people". And then you have the self-styled libertarians and college Republicans who love to think of themselves as independent-minded rebels against all those liberal sheep with their peace slogans and stupid folk music.  They are very eager to prove that their decision to conform and follow the standard business path is actually the pinnacle of nonconformity, which they do by wearing suits to every class and quoting Ayn Rand incessantly. And the cycle goes on and on, each group one-upping the other. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would like to think that during my life I've progressed through the second and third stages to where I am now, which is that of a cynical Socialist realist whose ideal form of government is enlightened despotism. But this is beside the point, which is that ALL political attitudes are formed around a desired self-image and in opposition to an undesired caricature. Which is why I consciously try to do nothing but state each of my positions as clearly as I can  without resorting to the common trope of making assumptions about the unstated worldviews of imaginary opponents. Of course, I can do the latter as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, back to the point, which of my stated positions struck you as cartoonish?

      First, I congratulate both AIU and Achilleselbow for well stating a view that may or may not be recieved popularly. I call it risking it all on authenticity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Two quotes sum up my view: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"The United States of America has the worst form of government on earth, except for all the others." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Apathy is a small man's premature death." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ach: be glad you feel, think and care. It's what makes ya' human! I invite you to inquire into what is lacking, the absence of which makes the difference in this country being all that you envision it capable of being, and then stand in the spot of being about that happening. If everyone took the time to do that, what would this country and the world look like?

      The Trumpster? That Donald?  I know it appears to be a change, but I actually used this avatar right after the handface weekend because it was available from my last job (magazine editor).

Its bouquet had a warm high note of a protein-rich, spicy meal, with a low garlic note and a tannic hint. We suspect that its production lacked sufficient water, and had ingredients consistent with too much Crab Louie, alcohol and tea. This vintage will not age well."

      For those not interested in scouring Cornelius' blog posts for the reference (like me, it would seem), Mr. Bear found a vial of sodium pentothal in a hidden drawer in his bar, and he and Roast Beef decided to secretly try it on Ray to see what kind of stuff he would say. <br/>

 <br/> 
2: Tina hit Roast Beef. You do not do that. Ray does not like that. See Great Outdoor Fight. <br/>

      No, that level of insanity is par for the course with cerebus.  I'm thinking of the generally accepted tipping point: the misogynistic screed in issue #186. <br/>

Seriously, they compliment each other in the slim ways that the other can't deliver on:  <em>Krazy Kat</em>  is never raunchy or colloquial, and  <em>Achewood</em>  is never mysteriously beautiful and innocent (maybe the Phillipe Kidnapped? arc approached that).

      The last Achewood comic published in his life possessed a footnote containing a somewhat oblique joke. O cosmic coincidence....
