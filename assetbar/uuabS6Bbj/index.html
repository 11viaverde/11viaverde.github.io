      I hate to get all music-geek on your ass, but that's more of a shuffle. Eighth and sixteenth (quaver and semi-quaver to us Brits, fact fans!) is fine for a fast swing feel. Think "Sir Duke".

      But then you're missing a quarter of a beat (equal to a 16th note [semi-quaver] in 4/4). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course in real jazz, the notation is merely eighth notes (played approximately like a dotted eighth and sixteenth). I provide the following as "confirmation." <br/>

      Eighth   sixteenth is a perfectly acceptable combination in any triple meter (3/8, 6/8, 12/8, or the Stravinskian 3/16), though a dotted-eighth   sixteenth would be a more practical syncopation in duple meters (2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 2/2, etc.).

      You did the correct thing. Onstad is wrong and tomatoes will continue to be terrible things that are only fit for consumption when processed into forms that render their intrinsic evil moot. <br/>

Waffles will continue to remain the superior food product. <br/>

      T-Mobile girls are trickster seductresses. I switched from T-Mobile prepaid to Verizon constantlypaid recently and I had to call T-Mobile first so I get my actual account number from them to port my phone number over. But the girl at the T-Mobile call center sounded so sweet and innocent that I was almost thwarted. She could tell that when I called to get my account number that I was going to use it to cancel my service. Why else would you need it? You could hear it in her voice. She went through the motions of saying "So...did you want to...add more minutes to your plan?" and like an assassin comforting his prey I said, "Yeah...I'll probably do that online pretty soon" and I remembered that this call was being recorded for quality assurance purposes and maybe if this girl failed one more time to convince a customer to upgrade their plan she would be cast out into the Winds and Economy. She sounded like she really liked her job too, it was the best thing she'd done with her life since she picked herself up by the bootstraps and walked out the strip club her head held high, her pimp's baby in her arms. And now I was sending her back to that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Was there  <em>anything</em>  else I could help you with today sir?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"No...Thanks." <br/>

Let me just say though, even though I'm pretty dissatisfied with my T-Mobile plan, I'd be lying if I said I ever got less than high quality customer from those guys, American or outsourced or otherwise.  I recently had to suspend my service for a few months (outta da country yo) and they were very polite and helpful and all that.  So if anything, get T-Mobile for the friendly service.  If you have a plan with another provider, you could call T-Mobile and just chitchat if you want.   <em>I know I would.</em>

      Eh... the quality of people you speak to is really less important than the company's internal systems and plans to screw you as hard and often as possible. With the massive number of people working in call centers and the high turnover rates there's almost nothing they can do to make the employees do a good job. I mean, they can find ways to make it a lot worse for you and impose contradicting metrics ("Make more add-on sales during customer service calls, but we really need you to get your call times down."), but they have no way or inclination to weed out the employees that are obviously and significantly incompetent. Doing so would also deprive them of 90% of their staff. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're talking to an idiot the best response is to just hang up on them and call back until you hopefully reach someone who knows what they're doing. Anything else will just cause them to fuck up your information in the system and create further problems. This might take some time.

      Does a class ring count as a guy ring?  I feel that people who wear their class rings long, long after high school is over (i.e. 28/29) should perhaps seek some other adventures.

      I hadn't heard of class rings before. I did a little light googling, and I want to know how they became so repulsively tacky. I can appreciate that the idea of all of a class having one shared memento of their time together is a pleasant one, even if it wouldn't be something I myself would set great store by, but there is no need to make that memento a sickeningly vulgar and showy piece of baublery which looks like it was designed by a group of brain damaged rappers who needed to spend a large chunk of their wealth before the end of the fiscal year as part of a complicated tax dodge. Some of those class rings were so ostentatious that the pope would have been ashamed to be seen wearing them.

      Sounding is definitely a thing. I wonder, however, why I have never seen someone who has decided that they wish to combine sounding with docking and produced full-on urethral penetrating intercourse. It seems like if it existed I would have seen evidence on Stileproject back in the day* or wherever such things seem to come up today. It seems perhaps a bit too far even for BME.

      I suspect that since he had the juice to get painted in oils, he's probably a junior aristocrat posing in his ceremonial role as a military man. <br/>

Just a guess and I could be completely off the mark, as the toffs of yore did actually get their hands dirty/bloody from time to time. <br/>

      Portrait of a Halberdier. <br/> 
Not quite a pike, but close enough. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The gold chain and prissy expression had me thinking otherwise, but apparently: <br/> 
"a young citizen soldier ... stands in cream and red with a sword at his hip and a halberd in his hand. It was painted when the Florentine Republic was under attack in 1529; the youth is a volunteer soldier ready to defend his city. <br/> 
The Republic was crushed after a siege in which tens of thousands of people died."

      In an effort to demystify the alt-text for some (or at least to save folks some time looking it up): Graham Kerr was a chef on American T.V. (and perhaps elsewhere) who had a show in the 1970s called "The Galloping Gourmet".  During this time he was a drunk.  I don't remember him as wearing a lot of rings, but I trust Onstad on that.  After he sobered up years later his new show was called something with his name in it rather than the previous title, which was too bad.
