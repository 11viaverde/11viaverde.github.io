      Why would anyone judge you? It's not like you're forcing anyone to eat Tofurters and oven fries. You're making a responsible choice, and I'd be with you if it weren't for the fact that I simply love meat. I hate myself a little for it, too.

      My girlfriend is vegan and what that has taught me is that vegans have invented or otherwise engineered very many very nice things for themselves and their non-vegan boyfriends to eat. Textured vegetable protein, nutritional yeast and anything made by Gardein or Quorn just off the top of my head. It ain't a New York strip, but I love it in a completely different way.

      In  <em>The World According to Garp</em>  John Lithgow plays a former NFL player who is a post-operation male-to-female; a full transsexual, vagina and all, when that stuff was far more dicey on a medical level than it is now. She's still proud of her football career, and talks about her "great pair of hands." It's a bad movie based on a good book, but that's not Lithgow's fault; his performance is the most convincing part of the flick.

      She doesn't just bite it off for no reason. She does so when her husband's car slams into the back of her student's car (inside which the illicit head is being given) which is in the driveway when it shouldn't be. What makes the bitten-off dick pale by comparison is the fact that the very same crash kills their youngest son. Irving really knows how to punch a nigga in the brains when he wants to.

      Lithgow did a signing at my bookstore a few years ago, one of the honest to God nicest people to do a signing in my years in the book business.  He signed whatever randomness the staff produced, with good humor, including a VHS copy of Footloose, and my own Shrek dvd.  He did the whole Muffin Man skit, too, which cracked me up.  So say what you want, most celebrities are dicks to 'service people' at these things, the guy was class.
