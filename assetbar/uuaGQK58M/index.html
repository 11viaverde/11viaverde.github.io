      Don't  <strike>know</strike>   <strong>give a crap</strong>  if anyone will be interested, but the blunt side is one of a few major defining and important characteristics of any good wrestling weapon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let me explain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
See the first shot Beef give Showbiz?  That's how a chairshot is supposed to be - hit flat against the body/top of the head*, maximizing flat impact area and thus minimising injury. <br/> 
 <br/> 
See it done well here: <br/> 
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145932/https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=lGw-cjIUj4M">The Rock did it with the best, and hit quite stiffly.</a> ** <br/> 
 <br/> 
See the second hit?  That will fuck you up, because it's on the edge of the weapon.  Unless you genuinely want to severely injure/kill*** your coworker/dickhead brother, don't do this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145932/https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=BgJCZk6rvlk">See someone doing it wrong.</a> <br/> <br/> <br/> There.  I hope you all feel informed. <br/> <br/> <br/> Not really.  I just wanted to say it, and spread the knowledge of how wrestling works.  It's fascinating, really! <br/> <br/> <br/> *NOTE: Never back of the head - lest, after repeated times, you want to end up with post-concussive brain damage-induced psychosis and ultimately hurt yourself and/or others.  See  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145932/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Benoit_double_murder_and_suicide#Chronic_traumatic_brain_damage">Chris Benoit</a> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
**Nonetheless, if ever you watch the positively wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145932/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Mat">Beyond the Mat</a> , you will discover the aftermath of this particular grueling match.  Namely, the thumb-sized gash in Mick Foley's head and the screaming trauma caused to his family who watched the whole thing.  Despite wrestling being choreographed, it's tough.  And if you're gonna play it hardcore, you WILL get fucked up badly.

      I wouldn't worry too much about trying to explain these simple facts to such people. I've known a lot of these types.

It's funny. I was a big fan a few years back. Then I got busy, life did it's thing and I ended up kind of forgetting about it. When I stopped reading it, it disappeared from my life. Most of my friends don't care about things like this.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then, just yesterday, I'm reading some random blog and I see that something called "The Great Outdoor Fight" is being put out by Onstad through Dark Horse. That was literally the first time I'd thought or heard anything about Achewood in, like, three years. I got to feeling nostalgic and I decided to see what ol' boy'd been up to. Obviously, there were a lot of surprises in store for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, potentially long, boring story short - I woke up early this fine morning, brewed some tea, did a J and told my girl I was stayin' in. I signed up and started reading. I then kept reading. You get the idea. It's been an interesting day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You know what? Achewood got  <em>really damn good!</em>  I mean, I loved it back in the day, but Chris has really taken it to an incredible level. In a way, I'm glad I was away for so long. I've been crackin' up literally all day, and that was made possible by my not having seen most of these. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's been a good day.

      Yeah, I was kind of considering that angle as I wrote that. I guess that is the sort of thing a stoned person would do. But honestly, high or not, I'm definitely not a "stay on the computer all day" kinda guy. It's just that this comic absolutely  <em>floors</em>  me. I know I'm preachin' to the choir, here, but this stuff is just pure genius. Once I got started, I almost felt like I had no other choice. I  <em>needed</em>  to do it. And truthfully, it was nice to force a day off like that. I straight  <em>carped</em>  that  <em>diem!</em>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, say what you want about the stuff, but being in such a state can really improve one's focus. I know that's not what it's known for, but it should be mentioned. <br/>

And I should stop talking about weed, lest I typecast myself. Also, I promised myself that today I'd do all the things I should've done yesterday, so here I go.  <br/>

      Probably. Beef is too nice not to. It probably wouldn't even enter his mind not to. I mean, he was quite prepared to let Showbiz come when he could've easily not told him about it at all. He only flipped his lid after some seriously off-key shit was said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That being said, Ray will understand the attendant risks of having a coked-up squirrel at his no. 1 knucklehead's big day, and will make sure Todd stays off the blow until the newlyweds peel out from the reception, all tin cans hangin from the back of their vehicle. <br/>

      You  <strong>do not</strong>  tell a person their wedding was, is, or will be boring. That is a basic question of decency.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, we know Showbiz is as well-acquainted with the concept as he is the epic poetry of John Milton or similar works of classic literature. But this strip really drives it home. He's just not a simple-minded and disgusting free-loader. He is, at his deepest core and in his truest essence, completely and totally self-interested.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Reading this strip, I am minded of Beef's outburst against Gramma K. Kudos to Onstad for being able to make a normally quiet and passive character show sudden strength on multiple occasions without it losing potency or becoming predictable.

      Achilleselbow, you are in for a sad surprise, because movie weddings are infinitely more interesting than actual weddings. No one ever fucking bursts in and stops the ceremony at the last second. The priest never has an idiosyncratic speech impediment. Everyone just forever holds their peace, and then you have to listen to the DJ play that song about celebrating good times come on.

      Depends on the religion.  Catholic weddings in my experience are just big parties with a bunch of people who are related to you, which is weird and fun, and there's usually a few young cousins getting drunk for the first time and makin' fools of themselves.  Lord preserve you from Southern Baptist weddings though.  I agree with pouf-Vlad up there that it's a weak factor of the modern Western condition that we feel embarrassed and bored by celebration, but there's also good reasons why this kind of ritual event has historically be associated with mind-altering substances.   <em>Dry-ass Southern Baptist weddings can go to hell</em> .

      Though I'm in Southern Baptist territory, I know very few of them, and have luckily never been to a wedding; though I've heard a few stories. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Catholic  <em>weddings</em>  are horrible.  About twice as long as, say, a Methodist wedding.  The receptions are often fun, if either Irish or Italian, as there's normally a lot of drinking.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
A Catholic wedding is basically a Catholic mass with a bit at the end where two people kiss.  It is horrible.

      Well, I suppose that's true, the ceremony itself gets pretty painful, but somehow I never remember that part.  I guess that a childhood of (quasi-)Catholicism trains you to go into a sorta trance mode once you hit the pew?  I'm pretty sure I stop recording memories at the first "and-also-with-you."

      Man, the Catholic Mass is the biggest scam ever. They force kids to sit and stand at periods through a two hour long ordeal with the promise of donuts and fluorescent mixed citrus drink at the end, and they expect us  <em>not</em>  to covet it and ignore the ceremony. And then we covet the drink and we're told that it's a sin, so then we have to show up next week on Saturday to confess to the same galdanged priest that gave the two hour long sermon in the first place, and you're all embarrassed, so you don't confess to him because he's hardly a neutral party, and instead make up something else like pushing Timmy into a puddle, or something, so now you've got coveting drink -|- lying to the clergy -|- pushing Timmy into a puddle, (because according to Catholic dogma, thinking it is as good as doing it, if only this were true to my love life) against you on your heavenly ledger. And then you have to go BACK to coveting mixed citrus drink tomorrow! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically what I'm saying is that Catholic Mass is engineered to send little boys to hell.

      2 hour mass? Holy shit.  The ones I went to as a kid were generally 50-60 mins, and they were unbearable.  I do remember trying desperately to come up with something to confess while waiting in line for my First Confession.  Not that I had such an ego do think I hadn't done anything worth confessing over, I was just trying to pick something that made it sound like I did something wrong but it wasn't my fault was it was in Anger. <br/>

      On the subject of long and bizarre religious services, I went to a Masonic Temple today.  A choir I'm in got a gig to sing at a ceremony thing they were doing.  I guess it was sort of a Masonic version of a Palm Sunday/Passover/Easter deal?  I'm not sure.  They had a sort-of communion, and there was a cross, and a guy who preached.  A lot of the ceremony seemed to be in some kind of code, though.  And the Temple itself was  <strong>creepy</strong> .  Imagine a small, dimly lit room; the walls were covered with all kinds of eldritch symbology, and they had gargoyles that make the Winged Monkeys seem tame.  Seriously, the place was scary.

      Well... I don't know very much about layered drinks, but perhaps green and yellow  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145932/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartreuse_(liqueur)">Chartreuse</a>  are what you're looking for?  However, I think the layering might get trickier if you want to incorporate actual iced tea / lemonade, since as I understand it density is the main thing as far as layered drinks go.  Practically speaking, I say you can go with either the layered drink as a shooter, or a more Long Island Iced Tea-esque drink in either radioactive green or radioactive yellow.

      Not the most hilarious Achewood ever, but emotionally resonant.  I didn't expect it could ever happen, but Achewood's really becoming a pretty effective love story.  I just wonder how Onstad will handle the first marital tiff.  Upon reconsidering, the end of the strip with Showbiz lying in the spotlight as the final line of fools rush in is sung is a pretty masterful stroke.

      Even said in jest, as I had said mine, I dig.  It's just I feel particular to my damnd llama, and folk who have come and gone went away from the llama.  Far be it from me to say what they choose!  But what I mean is the OPs, that is to say myself and mr_pete, we have understandings. Though I am weird about speaking for my llama friend, I feel we're hapy to accept more llamas to the the fray; all I want is a bit of conversation.  I'd like to get to know the new guy!

      I am so glad somebody got that.  I figured mentioning Mankind was too lowbrow for a wrestling nerd like I, mentioning Lobo from CZW or somebody from Big Japan (not that I know many, if any) would be too obscure, but vintage ECW would be just obscure enough.  Acheworld isn't much of a wrestling aficionado-type joint, rare company excluded.

      We took it further.  I don't know if I'm proud of this or not, but we were backyard wrestlers.  The Lesser Outdoor Fight.  Let me tell you a tale... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Amongst my friends - when 16-18, mind you - we had parties about wrestling, for sure.  But for no reason.  We just organised weekends to sit and watch the best wrestling we had (we'd each bring our offerings), play wrestling games on either Playstation (PS1!) or N64, eat gratuitous amounts of pizza and Pepsi, and then, to finish it off, we'd go into the backyard and wrestle. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But we were surprisingly intellectual about it.  We didn't just beat the crap out of each other - we'd work together and put on an actual show.  For all intents and purposes, we may as well have been pros.  Minus the money, of course. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Slowly, these "Wrestlefests" became more and more about the actual wrestling we'd do, until we were officially Backyard Wrestlers.  Videoing it and everything.  We were so cool.  Why nobody else thought we were cool was beyond us. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We thought we sucked at it, of course, until two events: 1. We had a cross-promotion with some guys from upstate.  They also thought they were awesome.  They weren't.  They brought some supermarket trolleys,  bits of styrofoam and a plastic baseball bat, and they thought they were  <em>hella hardcore</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
When we came brandishing a kendo stick, a steel trash can, 5 tables, 2 folding chairs, a hockey stick, a six-pack of beer, a wooden baton, a nightstick, a roll of barbed wire (my personal offering), and a road barricade that we stole - I have never seen a group of people so genuinely afraid of me before in my life.  They could tell we were in different leagues. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus, surprisingly, our technical ability was far better than theirs.  I have an amateur wrestling background, so I guess that accounts for a bit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. We looked on the internet.  And damn - in comparison, we were actually pretty good.  Because some people  <em>really suck</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, with this knowledge - and a fistful of teenage bravado and adrenaline - we pushed our limits as far as we could.  Each time, we'd see a boundary in our heads that we'd say "can't go past that, too dangerous" and the next event we would. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It started out with one table - and that tableshot was  absolutely horrible.  But I was scared.  We hadn't gone there before. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Next, it was two tables.  Then three.  Then two, one fire, wrapped in barbed wire - I've still got scars from that one.  Then it was more barbed wire - it was my signature, fire was my mates' one.  Then more and more guys started joining us, and they didn't know what they were doing, getting hurt and hurting each other.  Then there was more fire, until one kid got 3rd degree burns.  Then there was the tube lights.  So many tubelights.  So much mercury poisoning. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At this point, I started to lose the love.  It was costing a lot to buy all this stuff we were just gonna break anyway, and another guy was getting too controlling and pushing it too far - interestingly, he started to lose his mind around the same time as when  <em>he was inadvertantly inhaling massive amounts of mercury vapour from shattering tubelights</em> .  All in all, it was time to give it up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still have the tapes.  They are a sad, happy, and whistful reminder of a different time.  A time when you wonder how much was good; how much was bad; and really, at that time, how much was there a difference?

      That's how I like to see it.  He brought it over to watch at a party at our place, who knows why, and after we FFW'd through most of it just to placate him, he basically gave it to me as a gift.  I still like to think that he just loaned it to me, for obvious reasons.  Not that I'm necessarily some prude against porn, but the idea of "owning" porn just seems foreign to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ultimately, I just don't want to upset the guy, as he owns a rifle and, while showing it to me once, told me how he's "not psycho or anything, but I really want to just shoot someone, from like 300 yards out...and I could do it man, no problem."  Once the universe has had you meet this guy, it's best to just stay on his good side, I figure. <br/>

One more story, just for the road: I sold this guy my old car, and he eventually sold it a year later for crack money.

      Friend, your last statement is true as far as it goes.  But from the appropriate Wikipedia article: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>"Fools Rush In" (1940) is a popular song written by Johnny Mercer, who wrote the lyrics, and Rube Bloom, who wrote the music.<br/>
<br/>
The song has been recorded by many artists, most notably Frank Sinatra who recorded it twice in the 1940s and again in 1960 for his album Nice 'n Easy, which reached number one on the Billboard album charts. Ricky Nelson recorded a more rocking version that reached #12 on the singles chart in 1963.<br/>
<br/>
Elvis Presley recorded a version in 1972 (not to be confused with Elvis' 1961 song "Can't Help Falling in Love," which also features the lyric "Fools Rush In").</em></div> <br/> 
No link today because I am cross with Assetbar.  I know it's Wikipedia, but I feel guite sure the information is accurate, as it matches several other sources.

      That would explain the confusion. <br/>

All I know is that I once saw some stupid love songs compilation at Hallmark that had "Can't Help Falling in Love" on it but called it "Fools Rush In."
