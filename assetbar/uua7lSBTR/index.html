      It's not just that, it's that it would be amazing to discover a person that not only prefers Hanna-Barbara to Disney, but that apparently loves H-B, a cartoon organization, without any apparent knowledge whatsoever of the organization that basically began all cartoons.  The parts just don't add.

      Scooby-Doo didn't even have pretty colors, though! It was like everything was filtered through brown.

      Fair enough. Scooby Doo isn't really the best example of Hanna Barbera quality. <br/> 
... I only watched it for Scrappy. <br/> 
Yes. I'm serious. Scrappy was my favourite Scooby Doo character. Velma was a close second. Scooby and Shaggy annoyed me with their irrational cowardice and retarded costume antics... and no comment whatsoever about the two preppy shits.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nope. The only characters worth watching were the amusingly violence-enthused Scrappy... and the totally nerd-hot Velma.
