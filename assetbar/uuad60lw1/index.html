      Perhaps they are not seperate incidents. Perhaps Beef made an anonymous complaint before hand, safe in the assumption that his mother would probably be yelling at something, and be on meth. Almost remniscent of Micheal Corleone clearing out the dons at his son's baptism.

      IP bans are no good.  All he needs to do is reboot his router and get a new DHCP address and he's past it.  This sort of thing pretty much has to be handled by the community.  All the people saying DON'T REPLY TO HIM need to be listened to.  Complaining about him is the absolute worst idea, and making witty remarks to anything he says just makes it worse.

      The DHCP protocol has a specific means for requesting a new random address.  Most ISPs enable this.  If nothing else, most ISPs lease between 2 and 4 different addresses to a endpoint (home), one for each computer.  You can grab one on computer A, get banned on computer B, then tell B to spoof the MAC address of A and it will automagically grab the IP address of A as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are a lot of tricks to getting around dynamic IPs, and if we ban IPs and someone switches, it could very well block out a totally innocent user in the same area (this does happen a fair bit). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm thinking of a new policy where I keep AIU on ignore, and start burning all my lames on the people who keep responding to him.  A couple of people using that policy could get him properly ignored in a matter of days.

      I'm a little worried about that quote.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I did not expect the son of a bitch to make bail" implies that Showbiz  <strong>did</strong>  make bail, contrary to Beef's expectations. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The judicial system probably has more pressing cases than some guy messing with produce bins, so there's a good chance he'd have a month or so before his court date.

      Really strange but the original Modest Mouse version of Interstate 8 was like halfway through playing when I happened to read this. I don't see how Album/Band/Band connects to make a cover of one song, and especially not those albums and bands. But I am interested!

      That is an incredible goddamned idea. But, I am sorry to explain, those were three separate suggestions. But I think if you tried to actually put that together, the group would likely cancel itself out in a puff of unrelated excellence and we would be left with a half-page of Isaac Brocks' lyrics on a dusty rug, written on the back of a receipt, all cigarette-burn in the side of the page, empty bag of meth blows past because of a rotary fan. Somebody is knocking patiently on the door, but no one stirs... <br/>

Some folk, gawkers like us, see a storm brewin' on the horizon and titter and cluck about how the mystery man, the hero from out of town'll stride in at the last moment n' put things right in a crucible of pain and glory.  But there are other folks, though, like those who know they won't be able to rest their head easy beside that of the woman they made a promise to on a July day if they don't put down the trouble that's theirs to be put down.  And folks like that take care of the trouble in their own way, quiet and subtle, the only trace a blip in the back pages of the daily rag, without callin' out to the big heavy regulators from way down the road.  No messiah with blood on his hands makin' an impudent fool suffer in the house of God, just a man keeping his house in order.  My hat's off to you, Mr. Kazenzakis.

      While it is true that some libertarians are more concerned with the fiscal conservatism often espoused on select, precious few shows on FoxNews that at least talk in a straight line rather than the social liberalism that has come to hallmark more rational ( <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101017235741/https://reason.org/">reasonable?</a> ) libertarians as of late, this characterization that since libertarians share, sometimes quite vocally, one issue with the GOP (and, really, no issues with the neo-cons that have come to dominate the party), they must share them all, something that most certainly invokes great ire from many if not all.  I assure you, speaking only on my own behalf, that I do not nor would ever dream of owning a tshirt that thinks highly of the opinions of either Geraldo or Anne Coulter.  Quite the opposite!

      With kids though, that's a  <em>talent</em> , something to be admired by your peers for. Maybe the kid falls in with a group of awkward yet lovable misfits and gets a nickname like "Stinkbreath" or "Halitosis Hal" or if they are aware of irony, "Minty". Maybe they have a number of hilarious adventures together where they seek treasure, avoid girls, or track down criminals. Maybe they can get together, later, with decent paying jobs, kids of their own, and health insurance, and reminisce about times that once were, except for Angry Jimbo, who got stabbed up bad in that bar fight 10 years back. <br/>

      Man, Showbiz even fails at being a villain. After yesterday's strip I'd been expecting a lead-in to some dramatic, nay,  <em>epic</em>  confrontation, possibly involving folding chairs... But I guess Showbiz is just a  <em>can't</em> cer on society, to paraphrase Rowland.

      You were hardly alone in expecting such a confrontation; this situation does seem rather neatly wrapped up.  But then, Beef is about nothing if not understatement (well, that and depression.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do wonder how facing consequences on his own is going to change Showbiz, if at all; I'd imagine he'd come back into action the same old pig, but then Onstad has already bucked the readers' predictions once...

      I dunno. Guy like him, I get the feeling this is  <em>hardly</em>  the first time he's been in jail for petty crimes. So unless he somehow winds up sharing a cell with Miami and starts disparaging barbers while salad tongs are in reach, I doubt this'll qualify as life-changing.

      Onstad's got quite a track record of abruptly aborting what seem to be the beginnings of story arcs. He's commented in interviews that he does (or at least did) no real planning for longer stories and just goes one strip at a time. It's an understandable and often effective technique for an essentially one man operation with extremely high productivity expectations, but it does result in some jarring about faces. That's not always a bad thing; I'm still thanking my lucky stars that the lolcat story arc died peacefully in its sleep, for instance. In this case, I'm mostly just relieved that Beef will (apparently) not be further punished by his destroyed family.

      Not me man... I dont care about Roast Beef beating asses... this strip is perfect as far as Im concerned, its such a beautiful, ridiculous plan, knowing 6 Tequizas would never be enough, knowing that when they went to the store to get more Tequizas, it would be impossible for Showbiz to not bring the pain to the produce, knowing it would only put his brother away just long enough to keep him away from the wedding, and the final police blotter twist at the end... thats exactly why I read achewood. I probably shouldnt go too far with this post, but honestly, I wish people would kind of get over the great outdoor fight.... most of achewood, and most of what i love about achewood, has nothing to do with cat on cat violence.

      Well, yes, the epic confrontation needn't have been  <em>violent,</em>  as, yes, you're both absolutely right, Beef doesn't typically operate that way, but I expected there to be some more  <em>build up</em>  before Showbiz got his comeuppance. <br/>

I suppose it's my fault for even beginning to hope for major Achewood villainry that a man who can't spell "Nefarious," or, for that matter, read a clock.

      How odd.  I've heard several people complain how much they wanted one (on account of the cuteness, not eco-friendliness) but couldn't get one.  I don't understand since I like to drive fast.  Perhaps the oppressive and arbitrary hand of California state gubmint prevents the importation of microcars.  Either that or Oklahoma is way ahead of the curve in the importation of tiny cars, like it is with stealing basketball teams.

No, really though, I didn't intend to turn that into a shot at Kansasans. Kansans. Kans-asians. Whatever. Mostly it was the thought of having a car accessory to go with your main car, like a little runabout on a larger boat. It just happened to be initiated by the thought of a Smart Car tooling through the streets of a tiny town, the man who won it on the radio uncomfortably rubbing the back of his neck. Phrase that Pays my ass.

      It seems as though Showbiz has been safely removed from the picture without grievous bodily harm(not counting the Prison Ass-Pound we have all come to know and fear)and the marriage may continue without his interference. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can hear the sighs of the Assetbar denizens who had been wishing a painful death on Showbiz already. Kudos, Onstad.

      This is the way I feel about ______'s comments - he says something insightful reasonably often, but he hides it in a dozen paragraphs of utter Lame and I might consider chubbying him if he would drop the crap. <br/>

I guess that amounts to saying "if he were less annoying I would chubby him"  <br/>

      True.  Re: Wikidictionary <br/> 
 <br/> 
chav (plural chavs) (UK, pejorative) A working-class youth, especially one associated with aggression, poor education, and a perceived "common" taste in clothing and lifestyle.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>I wouldn't go to that part of town if I were you; it's full of chavs.</em>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Origin uncertain (see discussion page); probably of Romani origin. Compare Romani chavi (%u201C%u2018male child%u2019%u201D), chavo (%u201C%u2018female child%u2019%u201D), chal (%u201C%u2018boy%u2019%u201D), chavvy (%u201C%u2018mate, friend%u2019%u201D); possible cognate with Spanish chaval.

      I would suggest some kind of weaponry in event of the use of a skirt-lifter majigger. Always bring a knife to a skirt-lifter-majigger fight. They try to lift one of your skirts, you put one of them in the hospital. They try to nail one of you, you put one of them in the morgue.

      I always thought the purpose of the best man was to wait until the last second and silently hand the rings to the groom before purposefully strutting out into an open field where the sun is just starting to set, producing a guitar from nowhere, and shredding one of the best solos ever.

      There's a point to all of this. Slash's forsaking of the well-attended, expensive pomp inside the church for its isolated, rustic exterior, as well as the immediate change of his wardrobe from a tuxedo and top hat to an open leather vest shows that beneath the outward trappings of community and ceremony, man's true nature is forever to be untamed and isolated - a fact made fully explicit by the end of the video. Yet his still being there for his friend at the crucial moment despite his obvious distaste for such extravagance reaffirms the importance of the bonds between individual Men, even in the face of the realization that each of us is condemned to be alone.

      Man we don't even technically have strip clubs.  Toplessness isn't allowed.  You have to have 'covering', meaning pasties, meaning a thin layer of paint-on over the jubbly bits.  And yet, I could marry, knock-up, and divorce thirteen teenagers and still be behind the curve.

If there is alcohol, girls can only be topless. <br/>

      If you want to buy alcohol for use at home in Pennsylvania you have to go to the beer store or the wine/liquor store.  They don't even sell it all in one place.  A Sheetz gas station near Pittsburgh recently found some kind of loophole in the law that would let them sell six packs but they got shut down hardcore and the matter is on its way to the (state) supreme court.  So yeah, I live in a police state.  I should have just said that and been done with it.

      I thought Oregon was bad, with the state setting the prices for liquor, but apparently there are places with even more ridiculous alcohol laws.  Here, you can buy beer and wine in grocery stores, but liquor is sold only at state-run liquor stores, and the price across the state is set unilaterally by the Oregon Liquor Control Commmission, enabling them to charge ridiculous prices because there is no competition.  They make up all sort of ridiculous reasons for restricting liquor to state-run stores, but most people realize that the sole purpose of OLCC liquor stores is to make ridiculous amounts of money for the state.

I may never return to haunt these pages again, sadly.  In case (through reading my posts and interacting with my wolfish face) you feel that my presence will be missed, you can reach me at whiteturtle_@hotmail.com, and I will be happy to continue personal correspondence with any of ya'll.  I wouldn't do this normally, and feel a tad foolish even, but I have quite enjoyed posting here the last few months, and didn't want to leave without saying anything.  Thank you all for contributing to my daily happiness on a regular basis.

      [rant]Chabon could probably do it, but sometimes he tries to be too much of a smarty-pants for his own good.  I read his draft of Spiderman 2 while it was available online and at one point in the stage directions he makes reference to (pre-villain) Dr. Octavius looking at his tentacle device the way a car aficionado would look at a "1971 Chevrolet Barracuda". He specifies year, make, and model.  The problem is that  <strong>Plymouth</strong>  made the Barracuda, not Chevy, and no true car fan would call a '71 a 'Barracuda', they'd just call it a 'Cuda as it said on the name badge.  Finally, while a '71 'Cuda is an exceedingly decent car, it is relatively common.  Chabon probably meant a 1970 Hemi 'Cuda convertible which is extraordinarily rare and worth coveting.  [/rant]

      It was a remarkably literate durnken rant (with quotes and everything), so it was quite impressive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Last drunken rant i forced a taxi driver to endure was an incoherent proposal that afghanistan was better off during the eighties resting on the central argument "Cos at least the soviets had feminists and they drank beer and stuff" <br/> 
 <br/> 
In my defence this is why drunk people shouldnt have access to news radio programmes.

      Steroids may make the tree bigger, but they make his banana smaller. <br/>

Also, I think that breeding is what makes bananas bigger. Bananas were originally round and had seeds.

      Confusing, I didn't mean to just chubby that... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes there is a kind of severe vulnerability in banana crops globally not because they're all clones but because they're all from the same variety, so any weaknesses one of them has is shared by every other tree being grown commercially, pretty much. I'm sure if someone scrolls down far enough to read this they can wikipedia it and give you the name of the present variety we grow. They had the same problem with another one a few decades back. Cocoa plants are also grown from a small number of varieties, but witches' broom and stuff are less of a threat, I believe, because there is more genetic diversity.

      The Cavendish variety is the most popular, I just read in a National Geo article.  "The domestic banana that we know and love is an asexual clone, one that results from the sedate, artificial act of vegetative propagation. And no pollinated sex means no annoying seeds, which may be good news for hungry consumers but also means that there's little or no genetic variation%u2014and hence little or no resistance to the banana's many natural enemies." <br/>

      why would you stick the bit saying how much the regular bananas on the compartment that's selling organic bananas and vice-versa? It doesn't make sense, unless supermarkets are intentionally confusing in America. Or maybe to wind Showbiz up, which seems a bit like entrapment in that context.

      In one sense I agree, I have problems with people enforcing 'normal.'  In another sense this is some pretty pretentious posting.  You have fallen into the same trap you propose for others (and I'm walking in there behind you).  The last sentence is the perfect example.  "There is nothing so dangerous as thinking that one knows the truth."  So, are you saying that you know that everyone not being able to know the truth is the Truth?  I appreciate that you are trying to approach the perspective debate but you need to understand that you cannot claim a higher position for your perspective if you really believe that everyone's perspective is equally of value (Foucault's basic problem); even if your sense of truth is that there is no truth.  How do you justify that you are right and others are not?  You just offer another perspective, not one that justifies your warnings of danger.  I'm not saying you are wrong, but there is a whole other level of questions you need to ask yourself, or if you have, take into account in your posts about perspective.  Basically, you have to decide if you want everyone to be right, or if you just want to be right yourself, because it does not seem that any of us can have both. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Are you saying that all perspectives are equally valuable in society?  So, a psychopath has an equally valid perspective?  So a bigot has an equally valid perspective?  Society has restrictions on which perspectives are included and which are excluded.  Where I agree with you is when someone sets themselves up as the person who decides for everyone which perspectives are included and which are not.  On a message board like this, someone of garden variety dissent shouldn't really be ostracized as badly as you are in my opinion.  On the other hand...admit you like it (to yourself at least), because if you didn't you wouldn't keep coming back for more.  Hell, I like watching the wreckage in your wake.

I personally don't mind them that much, but I will take the majority's feelings into consideration and stop the meal here.  I will just say two last things to my troll friend there: <br/> 
1.  I will not put you on ignore <br/> 
2.  Do some reading..many great minds have considered these things you want to know about the system already.  the Philosophy section is the best place to start.  An educated troll is harder to ignore ;).

      Yes, yes, yes.  Again, friends, let me implore you all to use the "ignore" button liberally on this unfortunate man.  I now it's tempting, but trying to reason with him, one-up him, or even telling him that you are ignoring him is unproductive.  Ignore and move along.  Maybe you want to read through all the new comments before clicking ignore, you don't lose the highlights.  Then come back and ignore.  Do not give it a second thought.

      vChub. I like how you linked to the lyrics page rather than an online video, subtly pointing out the very  <em>poetry</em> , sir, of Carlin's stand-up performance.

      Normally I hate posting in here when it's not about the strip.  But George Carlin was like a hero to me, he was the first stand-up comedian I have memories of.  His material, a mix of linguistic word-play and daily observations, brought us humor in the most unlikely of places. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He is a legend, and he will be missed.

      This post is quite late, and therefore likely to be seen by exactly no one. But in case any of you kids are glorifying produce bin mayhem, I feel that it's a story that needs to be told. <br/> 
 <br/> 
During my lunch break, I for some reason walk over to the nearby supermarket and buy a peach. There are two displays of peaches side-by-side...each virtually identical, with the difference being that one seems to be sprayed with some sort of pesticide that gives me a mild allergic reaction, and the other one is simply delicious peachy goodness. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Today, with a whole $2.50 burning a hole in my pocket, I thought I'd splurge and get two peaches. Ever careful, I took two from the correct bin and ate them on the way back to work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But lo, horror of horrors: someone had carelessly or maliciously placed  <em>the wrong peaches in the bin</em> . Within half an hour, my arms and hands were covered in red dots, my face went pale, and I had to leave work. I've been violently ill since. I'm not shitting you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So kids, view the produce bin as a sacred receptacle whose contents should never be trifled with. It might seem like fun at the time (and judging by the reaction of some of my co-workers, might seem hilarious afterwards), but every cause has an effect. And in this case, that effect was that I got to go home early looking like I had some mutant strain of monkey pox. <br/>
