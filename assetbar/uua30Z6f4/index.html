      I'd actually go as far as to say that only 10% of their songs are COMPLETE jag-off. And 15% are actually really good. <br/>

      Eh, let's face it, it sounds like Onstad has listened to 69 Love Songs, and a lot of that is kind of conceptual jag-off.  I can appreciate most of the songs on there, but there's a reason why I made a mix-CD years back called 25 Love Songs.  Hell, I think Merritt even recommends doing this in the liner notes/interview booklet.

      I've never understood this comparison either (and I used to hear it all the time, not just here). I'm not a huge fan of either band, I like a few of both bands' songs here and there, but seriously. I can't imagine Coldplay ever creating anything like "Sunday Bloody Sunday." Conversely, I can't see dreck like "Speed of Sound" (or even a decent song like "Clocks") coming out of U2's catalog either.

      I don't think "Sunday Bloody Sunday" is a good reference point, as that was early U2.  Most people who compare Coldplay to U2 are defintely thinking post-"Joshua Tree" U2, when they started to become the Biggest Band in the World or whatever they get pegged as.  U2's singles in this time were epic, somewhat melodramatic and self-important, and undeniably pretty fucking catchy, and relied on a singer with soaring, earnest vocals and a guitar player who wasn't afraid to come up with simple riffs and base a lot of his work around effects pedals.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've mostly avoided hearing Coldplay songs since their second album, but what I've heard can kind of match that description pretty well.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, just look at the lead singers' personalities: a bit scruffy lookin' but the ladies love 'em, large international celebrities and both seemingly on a mission to save the world, whether honest and well-intentioned or self-aggrandizing and attention grabbing (I'm not going to argue that here).
