      I've known some people who don't like music. They're not the type you'd think lack a soul and a heart, but one day you're asking them "so what do you listen to nowadays" and they answer "i don't like music" and then you just skip a beat like you just saw a mouse eat a cow.

      You just kind of have to understand that some people have to deal with a lot of noise in their lives, like literally. Big families or something, always around, like seven TVs left on at their highest volume and at all hours, in one tiny room, etc. <br/>
