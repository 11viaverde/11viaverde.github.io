      well i happen to like primus, but that's beside the point <br/> 
 <br/> 
the point is that at the peak of being a bassist you would be les claypool <br/>

he's one of those people that just makes you want to give up trying to be good, because you know you can never be  <em>that</em>  good

      Listen to Bootsty Collins, or Matt Freeman from Rancid for some awesome bassists if you don't like Primus (heathens). Or Death From Above 1979, dude basically plays his bass like a guitar. Hell, some G&R songs have awesome bass lines.

      Not to sound like too much of an old man, but you can't go wrong with John Entwhistle and the Who.  James Jamerson and the old Motown stuff also.

      No, you absolutely can't go wrong there. John Entwistle is essentially the man who invented the concept of the rock bassist being noticed when people listen to the music. (Of course, the Who were beautifully backward in their entire musical arrangement, with Pete playing the rhythm on the guitar and John and Keith basically taking melody over on the bass and drums) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also of conceivable mention here: Cop Shoot Cop. More than a bit of a Foetus knock-off, sonically, but they did have 3 bassists instead of having any guitarists and sounded damn good doing it, especially on  <em>Ask Questions Later</em> ... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Similarly, Brujeria, but they're more of a joke side-project than anything else. Fun times, though.

      Any band that can produce the lyric "I'm the one that gave the sandwich to Mama Cass" more than deserves mention. Oh, and they (he) also helped start the original industrial rock/metal movement. I suppose that's important too.

      someday listen to "enter the exterminator" and think about how it it sounds like nine inch nails. then think about how it predates nine inch nails <br/> 
 <br/> 
well we're on the subject of industrial music, i have a list of arguments against nin (i still like them but they're kind of a guilty pleasure anymore, and i feel like there's a good fanbase for them on this site and people need to know) <br/> 
 <br/> 
on the album the downward spiral, track one is called mr. self destruct. some ten years prior to that soft cell had an album called this last night in sodom, track one was called mr. self destruct. nin's was not a cover; however, on a remix album for the downward spiral he covered soft cell's memorabilia.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
also someday listen the big come down and the intro to terrible lie by nin, then listen to the drum beat in stairs and flowers by skinny puppy and not the similarity <br/> 
 <br/> 
it's an unusual beat for them to both have come up with independantly <br/> 
 <br/> 
industrial music was so much better when it wasn't mainstream <br/> <br/> <br/> and the mama cass line always got me

      You know, I got into an argument with a friend recently about the Who, particularly Keith Moon's drumming, and he pulled out that old chestnut "a drummer just needs to keep the beat, that's why I'll always like Bonham more than Moon"... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I made an argument similar to yours, but I've always seen the Who as a band comprised of soloists.  Sounds like a fucking nightmare, but that's what's great about the Who: they normally made it work. <br/>

      The problem is nobody ever lets the bassist show off. I'm sure there's a lot of amazingly skilled bassists out there, they just never get the chance to show us that they are amazingly skilled. Poor bassists.

      That is entirely correct. I do not entirely know why, but there is a ludicrous number of cases where the only female member of a band plays bass. I am continually perplexed by this phenomenon. <br/>

Female bassists are also scientifically proven to be hotter than female guitarists. Again, I cannot explain this, but it is so.

      That's how I do it as well. But it helps to have something a bit more fun to play every once in a while. Otherwise it can just get deadly boring and you forget why in the hell you wanted to learn to play in the first place.

      Favorite rock band jokes heard from my roommate: <br/> 
-How many drummers does it take to screw in a lightbulb? <br/> 
None. We have machines that do that now. <br/> 
-How many drummers does it take to screw in a lightbulb? <br/> 
Doesn't matter. Neil Peart did it better. <br/> 
-Did you hear about the bassist who locked the keys in the van? Took 'em an hour to get the drummer out. <br/> 
That's the way I heard them from him, though I'm sure plenty of people have switched out the drummer for the bassist.

      teodor is a better choice for "woman of the band" because he is a better cook.  nice pete will have considerably tastier stews to look foreward to.
