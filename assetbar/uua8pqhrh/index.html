      Look dude... sometimes when I voice my mind, folks find it funny... and sometimes when I voice my mind, folks find it dickish. Either way though, it falls into the same category of self-expression. <br/> 
And I'm not going to stop being self-expressive just because folks are getting sand in their butts over it and seem to think it is all about them.  <br/> 
I mean c'mon... Do you honestly think someone as egocentric as myself is gonna be doing any of this  <em>for other people</em> ? <br/>

Just think about it.  <em>Even when he's filching some dude's ketchup to sneak a swig from it,</em>  he's 100% pure playah about it -- because, in his mind, this IS cool.

      What parts of this arc didn't make sense or follow logically for you? Mexican magical realism was an established part of the Achewood universe, and it explains why the helicopter with the luchador paint job acted the way it did, and we find out its origin in this strip. Butters being tempted here is the result of his established low class and predilection for Hunt's ketchup, and what happens to him because of his trespass is appropriate because he made Ray believe he was going to die soon at the beginning of the arc.

      One time some friends and I were coming off of an acid trip, and I was right at the point where the hangover was mixing with the last remnants of the trip.  Someone turned on the lights unexpectedly and in the sudden silence i said, in the smallest voice possible, "man why you gotta do a thing."  Everyone gaped for about half a second and then burst out laughing.  It was probably the best thing achewood has ever given me.
