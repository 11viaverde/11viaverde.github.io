      The effect of a poster's avatar on his post takes an interesting turn when the avatar is of the poster himself. In this case, I find it worthwhile to note that not only does your expression perfectly fit your post, it also briefly leads me to imagine you highlighting a fleshlight with magic wand, copy/pasting it into Randy Savage's raised fist, and then posting the finished product on Achewood, open in another tab-- a wealth of context that's all delivered thanks to your half-bored, half-curious expression <br/>

      I don't know if there's a gay version. I mean they have ones that are supposed to be women's, um, buttholes instead of vaginas, so I guess the next time you shave you could just take your discarded stubble and glue it on one of those, and you'd be good to go.

He is a specific type of internet character-actor as far as I can tell, of a style I can generally appreciate.  <br/>

If he  <strong>did</strong>  mean any of his many, many words, then your words are totally correct in assessment. <br/> <br/> <br/> also NO

      Yea, I think autrepoupee is right. I mean the hilarity of it is that I pretty much just repeated his own initial 'your mom' joke back to him. It reminded me of the hate mail on realultimatepower by that one guy who claimed to be a real ninja soke who's gonna find Robert Hamburger and kick his ass. Or maybe it was just in the book, which everyone should read. <br/>

But alreadyinuse, the point of language is to make assertions and state facts! You are corrupting the essence of communication!

      As opposed to the inherently non-sexist of idea of replicating a vagina for men to fuck in their lonely times? It's really no different in form, the name is not really adding anything to or taking anything away from any sexist notions associated with the object. Are you suggesting a disembodied vagina is any less sexist than referring to that disembodied vagina as flesh? ...

      It could also be that the thing kind of looks like a FLASHlight, and not that there were evil sexist marketing execs who decided "Let's make women feel even worse about their lot by comparing them to meat." Coming from an Advertising background, I have never met anyone who acts this way. We need to stick to the Politically Correct code that everyone else does.

      we had to watch "brian's song" in high school gym class, which is the area in which the differences between dudes and puddles are most strongly delineated.

      Another for the Roast Beef's Cocaine Buisness Plans file: <br/> 
Sell sticker sets to be used in conjunction with the cards. If receiving the card was indeed Just Sick as  <em>Hell</em> , the "Perfect" sticker is applied. In the case of an inter-dude card giving attempt being botched, the "Way Too Baring of the Emotions" sticker may be utilized.  <br/> 
I feel this will help with the inherent issue of creating more sales, and is also imperative for the exchange of appreciation or indicating the need to improve one's dude-card signing technique all while avoiding the use of emotion, which is the primary objective of the Universal Card for Dudes franchise.

      that's cop style flashlight. best for beating people with.  <br/> 
there was this never ending ongoing case in my old county. these cops were busting up a party and this one decided to beat this obnoxious drunk on the head with his 3 D-cell Mag-Lite.  <br/> 
the dude died and many witnesses testified that they saw the flashlight break and the saw the batteries come flying outta there. the case went on and on and the witnesses got discredited 'cuz they were "drunk". and they were. but many saw this happen. the case went on so long that most of the witnesses started to disbelieve their own testimony.. i mean they were drunk and it happened so long ago.  <br/> 
the cop said he never used his flashlight on the drunken reveler. not sure what the outcome was, tho i doubt the cop was ever justly reprimanded (a murder or manslaughter charge).

      Usually with ladies-only stores a dude can come in if he is accompanied by a lady. Gendered spaces are problematic, but I think it is a good idea for sex shops. Not that all sex shops should be gender-segregated, but I think it is nice for women to have a place to go for sex toys without having to worry about how their sexuality is being displayed to men.

      Mostly because men will often go in and to prove that they're not gay will go HA HA LOOK AT THIS and then show things that they think they should find funny, and then the workers will be all OH JESUS and have to listen to two guys in puca shell necklaces with their dull girlfriends browse for ten minutes and leave without saying a word. Or, they get a person like me, who just stands there. If they ask me to leave, I shake with anger and urinate.

      My first introduction to porn in 5th grade was two of my reject friends and I finding torn magazine pages buried by the school playground fence. For an entire week we returned there every evening with a flashlight to gaze in wonderment. And it wasn't Playboy or even Penthouse, but some trashy local mag that almost certainly isn't printed anymore. I mean there were extreme closeups and the girls were so nasty that for the longest time afterward I was convinced that a vagina was  <em>supposed</em>  to look like a loose hanging scrotum with an opening cut in it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I spent a lot of time thinking about the things those women did.

      My friend's Scottish dad had a huge stash of porn. We wound up sneaking out one or two which I kept and, well, dated throughout most of junior high. It was really ranchy stuff, vadge right in your face. When another friend greedily showed me a Penthouse, I scoffed and showed him the mad vadge that was all up in that UK porn.

      My first introduction to porn was awesome. My brother and sisters and I found my dad's VHS stash, and we were SO EXCITED to check it out. We waited until my mom went to the store for whatever, and my dad was at work, and we put it in the VCR and watched it... for about two minutes. At which point the VCR started eating the tape. We could not, for the life of us, get it out of the VCR. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Needless to say, when my mom got home, we got the "you need to know that this is not what sex is really like" talk. <br/>

      Now that you mention it, there was a porno mag that was stuffed in the playground fence at my elementary school.  I remember many people crowding the fence for multiple days until someone tipped off the teachers.  I never managed a glimpse, but I had been told all about it and because of this my imagination of the female body was skewed for a few years.

      <insert fanfic about Spinynorman and Margargaret meeting in a dark, humid street, middle of the night outside a shop of questionable materials.  Margargaret leaning against a streetlamp smoking Pall Malls, eyes looking around smugly and seductively, waiting to meet Spinynorman, a man she arranged to meet.  It was a wild move on both parts, as they had only talked on the phone briefly to arrange the meet, but she was feeling wild.  Wild enough to mask her blinding fear.  Spinynorman comes sauntering up the alleyway - he had taken a back way to avoid suspicion and anyone recognising where he was headed.  His hands are sweating with anticipation and excitement, not knowing what to expect.  Their eyes lock in the distance, and for a brief frightening eternity they recognise one another and try to think of their next move....> <br/>

It's too late for either of them to flee, so they shakes hands and bump into each other as they enter the sex shop. Spinynorman immediately spots a fleshlight and proffers it to Margargaret, who counters with a slivery dildo. <br/> 
"I see you know your way around a Steely Dan," says Spiny, ever the cultural-referencer. <br/> 
"That's what she said," parries M, llicking her luscious lips.

      I remember a little place near the University of Tulsa campus that I think was called something like the "Wizard Shack" or something to that effect--it was a combination head shop/place to buy things that are not generally accepted in Oklahoman society, and they sold a few very basic sex toy and erotica items in the back.  It was a small nondescript building with the windows boarded up like at a titty bar, and it had a definite air of furtive discreetness about it, like they were afraid of being shut down at any moment or possibly torched by an angry mob of Oral Roberts University students.

      Shame on you who think Roast Beef would use a default typeface rather than go through the trouble to find the perfect Dude font. That's no Times New Roman%u2014it looks more like a Palatino or something similar. The apostrophe gives it away. Serif font for manliness, a bit of style for swagger and the barest hint of emotion.

      I have only seen  <em>The Dead Zone</em>  (Can't go wrong with Christopher Walken) and  <em>A History of Violence</em>  (Awesome) but judging by the description of  <em>M. Butterfly</em>  it looks interesting...

      I Am Sorry I Have Only Seen Two of David Cronenberg's Movies And To Be Honest I Only Saw  <em>The Dead Zone</em>  Because My Roommates In College Loved Watching Bad Movies So They Could Make Fun Of Them Although I Think We Generally Genuinely Agreed That Christopher Walken Is Awesome But Yeah I Never Got Around To Watching More Cronenberg Because When You Have Those Kinds Of Friends That Watch Movies Directed By Joel Schumacher And Jerry Bruckheimer Any Unfamiliar Director Whose Name Sounds Remotely Jewish Enough Starts To Run Together In Your Mind <br/>

      I'd recommend  <em>Videodrome</em> , the remake of  <em>The Fly</em> , [i}Dead Ringers[/i], and  <em>Naked Lunch</em>  as the best places to start.  That is like "Golden Age" Cronenberg.   <em>History of Violence</em>  and  <em>Eastern Promises</em>  are like a more restrained, older Cronenberg, still pretty interesting, but with fewer hallucinations and horrible mutations.

      YES.   <em>Dead Ringers</em>  was a shite strike of brilliance.  See  <em>eXistenZ</em>  ( <em>it's so deep, man</em> ) and of course  <em>Videodrome</em>  is the sickest shit ever.   <em>Naked Lunch</em>  be alright...

      I think this is a good place to plug the achewood chat again. I feel it's necessary, because we have a good community of regulars going already, but  <em>just not enough</em> . Tekende and Margaret and mira and farqussus and all the rest of you who are slowly becoming regulars, back me up. There are even achewood fans in the chat that don't post on assetbar who have found it through other strange and  <em>unsettling</em>  ways. Download mIRC, folks, type in /server slashnet.irc and /join #achewood. We are having a grand old time, and I will assign a random word to your name that kicks you out of the chat any time anybody says it. This is not an optional feature.

      No, but you should really see the Peter Jackson trilogy. I mean I know it's cool to find fault with it and all, but I was enough of a Tolkien nerd to have read the Silmarillion and the Book of Lost Tales, and I still think they're awesome. I really couldn't care less that they left out Tom Bombadil even though he may actually be Eru Iluvatar, and the Scouring of the Shire was cool but I can see why they left that out as well. Otherwise I think the movies really captured the spirit and atmosphere of the books rather well and were just damn good in their own right.

      I recently discovered an animated version of the first DragonLance books ( <em>starring <strong>Kiefer Sutherland!</strong></em> )  I watched it, and was saddened.   <br/>

The Bakshi LOTR couldn't hold my attention when I was younger.  I dreamed of the day we would have the technology to do what Peter Jackson did, and I'm glad he did it with his hairy hobbit foot planted firmly down on the gas pedal. <br/>

      Meet the Feebles is great to watch with a group of raunchy friends, especially friends who have seen/appreciated The Muppet Show.  It is outrageous.  It was "Robot Chicken" and "Drawn Together" before these existed (and, it was better than both of those). <br/>

Even "Forgotten Silver" is fun to watch--a very realistic mockumentary with Woody Allen style. <br/>

      Man, 'cunt' is such a great word. It's so... blunt. Cunt. Blunt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
According to Wikipedia, it used to be acceptable as an anatomical word and wasn't considered vulgar. It could also be spelled as 'queynte'. But I think the best part is that several towns had a street famous for prostitution called Gropecunt Lane.

      It reminds me of the word "blunt," too, but that makes me think of a blunt object, which is kind of the opposite of a cunt. "Cunt" is an anti-onomatopoeia. The English language has done better.

      It is a word which should be used only with great caution, clarity of purpose and cognisance of the spectrum of interpretations and offence it may cause, and only in situations which demand it (e.g. discussing the inherent misogyny of English-language vulgarities, or when you are hit by a blue shell in Mario Kart).

      I'll take both "cunt" over "bitch" any day. And I think the worst is using "pussy" as an insult. If you want to insult me by calling me a cunt and reducing me to my genitalia, fine. I don't love it, but people get called dicks or cocks or pricks all the time. Equating cowardliness with something definitively female and implying it's wildly undesirable to be associated with femaleness? Fuck that shit.

      On that note, though, the use of the word "dick" as an insult has the connotations of a jerk or unpleasant person. That's exactly the same kind of senseless discrimination that we don't need. My cock's self-esteem isn't great as it is.

      Yeah, but calling someone a "cunt" means jerk or unpleasant person, too. Same with "asshole." It's just kind of generally insulting to associate someone with nether regions and waste elimination. (Though there is some difference between "cunt" and "dick" because of unspoken cultural background in which men are privileged over women.) (I'm running my mouth off about feminism, and I think I am going to go take a nap instead.)

      I've never really found "Cunt" to be any more offensive than any other swear. But in my neck of the woods it's just as likely to be a term of endearment as it is to be hurled in a fit of rage. <br/>

      I used to absolutely hate it, but over the years it's sort of stopped bothering me. I'll even use it occasionally, but only when someone is really deserving (I have in fact used it here on Assetbar once). It is really nasty when being used in "reference to someone's junk", though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thing I don't understand is, why bother making up different words for the female genitalia, when "vagina" is just about the best word ever? I'm not saying that in a fit of feminine pride, I just really think it's such a good word.

      Yeah, she's Canadian, but the book takes place in America. And most of her books take place in Canada, so that was probably a deliberate choice. Of course, maybe that's just what America seems like to Canadians. Maybe she was just like, "I'm gonna write a book about that country down there," and it came out like that.

This a a dishonest statement because I have not actually seen the Vagina Monologues, but the idea of them makes me writhe. I tend to think of myself as a human first, and a woman second.

 <br/> 
I saw it with my then-boyfriend, and he loved it too, and I'm not sure why thinking of yourself as being a human over being a woman would make you not like it, because it is about humans and people of both genders find it really powerful, it's not as if stories about women are not stories about humans, or as if men cannot identify with stories about women, and I don't even believe in that "enhanced empathy" from women thing anyway, because I think empathy varies by individual and not by gender! <br/>

      I agree (soupkaty).  It's an thick, ugly, gutteral sounding word when said, and thus, a great cuss.  Almost all cusses are so disassociated from their literal meanings (whether that's good or not), I've never understood why "cunt" is so different.  If I call someone a "cock" it has nothing to do with a penis; the word is accepted as an insult in and of itself.  Most people take umbrage at just being called something, the literal meaning makes no difference.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, cunt seems to be so much more taboo these days in the US than it ever was in the UK when I lived there.  People I've talked to recently would say this is still the case.  Why come, America? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I got into this same argument with a friend recently.  He had just started dating this bright-eyed recent college graduate, and through her he got Feminism, and suddenly started arguing with me about this word.  I speak of this girl's feminism mockingly (hell, I often call myself a feminist), as she's as serious about it as she is her Veganism...she eats fish.  Yes, she says it's okay to eat fish as a  <em>Vegan</em> .

      exactly! i don't understand why it should be percieved as so much harsher of a word than calling someone a prick or any of the vast variety of terms for male genetalia. <br/> 
i've been reading trainspotting, and i lost count of how many times cunt is said. this may be why its been slipping into my everyday speech. <br/>

      Twat is much better for dirty songs, where rhyming is necessary.  It's hard to rhyme cunt without forcing it, with the exception of "A kick in the cunt" from  <em>Run, Ronnie, Run</em> .  I think that's why I brought up twat in the first place, because, as a rugby player, I appreciate offensive songs, and twat is used in more of them than cunt.  Songs like "The Whore in the Park" would not be the same without the word twat.

However when i replied to myself stating that id fucked up i got a lame from a stranger. But thats fine, i expected that. Serves to prove my point though.

      I imagine the band would ideally be a Musical Collective type scene. Like Broken Social Scene, sometimes we'd have like 30 dudes rocking on stage with mighty ukues, other nights a sprightly 12 ladies with hands on their faces singing a chorus of something or other. Sometimes it might just be Dr_Manflesh with an accordion singing a ballad.

      Actually it is a prayer to Shiva. So Om <something like> Niva Shiva. My wife learnt a song at her choir once and when she sang it at home I pointed out that it was from Temple of Doom. Then we drank some Black Blood of Kali and got our slant on.

      It is necessary for personal service.  Other forms of service (posted, published, etc.) aren't authorized or effective for jury duty.  And they also can't establish that you received those photo-speeding tickets.  More often than not, the apparatus of the state counts on the suckers sticking their own neck into the noose.

      All I'm saying is I've gotten tickets from photo cameras for running red lights or speeding in the mail from cities in four different counties.  Since I neither contest them nor pay them, they always end up writing them off.  This has gone on for about seven years now.  If and when LA County thinks it's important enough to send a process server, or sheriff's deputy over, I'll either reconsider my stance, or more likely, move to a different county.  (That has gotten me out of jury duty twice.)  Luckily my backyard is bisected by the LA/San Bernardino county line, so I won't have to move very far.

      I work for fine enforcement (in Australia) and trust me, they  <em>never</em>  go away. I've seen people go to prison because of an accumulation of shitty little fines that they've never paid.

She asked them how they felt about the Brits, and they responded, "Oh, great! We like them, they like us!" <br/>

      How things change.  Back in my day, any Aussie caught liking the Brits was skinned and flayed, almost worse than liking a Kiwi.  Liking the Americans was tops, we were like their big brothers or something. <br/>

      North American Scum, is a nice piece of ironic work by LCD Soundsystem. The "irony" is not most of the reason it is popular here. <br/>

Anyway, stupid Australians dislike stupid Americans. Mainly because stupid Australians are never allowed to say anything good about anything they've acheived ever. Stupid Americans never stop doing this.

      One time, to mess with my sister I insisted to my parents that I buy her birthday cake. Then, I went for days searching every bakery and ice cream shop in Charlotte for the perfect cake. I dabbled into the border of South Carolina, peeked in Elon, and yet found  nothing suitable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then, the day before her birthday I walked into a local bakery (titled, appropriately, "Bakery") and found the one cake that was so perfect I knew not what to do. I mean, I knew to buy it, but beyond that I didn't...well ok I knew I would eat it too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, the next day I my sister had her birthday party, and I presented her with  <em>it</em> . A cake with a plastic bass head sticking out of the top and crested with the sea-green letters "Nice Catch, Steve!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
It became a family tradition from then on to only give each other wildly inappropriate cakes and cards for our birthdays. <br/> 
 <br/> 
FYI: The bass cake was a red velvet cake.

      I am not a fan of Hirst, but I especially don't like that skull. He made a lot of money off putting some animals in formaldehyde, and now he is rich enough to pay people to glue diamonds on a skull. I don't understand why he gets credit for that. He is more of a commissioner than an artist. How many dudes have gotten high and been like, "You know what would be totally sweet? A skull with some fucking  <em>diamonds</em>  on it." The only difference between them and Hirst is that he has enough money to pay people to execute the idea. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, from Wikipedia:  <em>Hirst said that he only painted five spot paintings himself because, "I couldn't be fucking arsed doing it"; he described his efforts as "shite"%u2014"They're shit compared to ... the best person who ever painted spots for me was Rachel. She's brilliant. Absolutely fucking brilliant. The best spot painting you can have by me is one painted by Rachel."</em>

      Here is the thing: I couldn't think one interesting thing to say about him on my way home from work. Which is pretty telling, since the whole goal of his work seems to be to rouse controversy and conversation (as it is with many artists). I just find his work extremely boring.

      It probably was made out of blood diamonds. It is pretty much impossible to avoid a blood diamond unless you have an audit trail right back to the mine, which probably means buying from a dealer who dealers with the mining company. This is actually pretty rare.

      It was not the fact that you said a gay guy would not accept a card from another gay guy that offended. It was the way you phrased  your statement. The basic premise that gay men are just as masculine as most men is true (most gay men prefer to maintain their gender identity, which whether it is backed up by scientific fact or not [this is a whole other discussion [damn, look at me going all triple brackets]], currently includes a diassociation from emotionality) your use of the word "sister" and...I lost my train of thought... <br/>

      I had a friend growing up who was (and still is) half-Sudanese and half-Anglo - an uncommon thing in Australia at the time (given that there were only 24 immigrants from Sudan to Australia prior to 1994), and it was kinda cool to have some Africa around the place again, after having spent an earlier part of my youth in Virginia and Malawi, where in both cases I was the lone redhead white boy in the neighbourhood.  Felt odd to be surrounded by a bunch of pale faces at school all the time.  Not the reason we became friends, mind you, but an aside. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I - being ever the child geneticist ethno-biologist - had come to the conclusion that, because of the obvious climatic factors that our ancestors came from, then surely it would apply that while he could hang out in the sun all freaking day and be nearly fine (he was half white, after all), surely then I would be a lot better in the cold.  I mean, it just makes sense, right? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Wrong.  The fucker's a competitive swimmer - he feels neither cold nor hot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I felt so genetically inferior.

      Okay spinynorman the post you just made made me think of a few things. First of all, to understand any of this you have to understand that I recently completed an internship with NPR's Arts and Cultural Desk. It is one of the smallest bureaus at NPR and it is really just a part of the National Desk so I always felt like we were disrespected. Anyway, we had an advanced computer network and whenever a reporter or producer had some digitized audio to share they could put it in a folder called "The Cultural Bin" and there were bins basically for every department at NPR. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I told you that story to tell you this story: I was about to say something I thought was witty which was "Dude you are so cultural I am going to put you in my  <em>Cultural Bin</em> " but then I was like "Spinynorman does not work for NPR so he would not get that joke at all the first thing he would associate that concept with would probably be the Recycle Bin on his own computer and also that sounds too affectionate for a card between dudes." <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then I thought "Hey wouldn%u2019t it be kind of weird if there was an actual Recycle Bin that was actually labeled the Cultural Bin to fool people?" and I imagined this little vignette where an arts reporter was trying to get a story on  <em>All Things Considered</em>  and it went like this: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Reporter:</strong>  Hey there, Boss! I got that Cultural piece about the South African refugee throat singers for ya! <br/> 
 <strong>Editor:</strong>  Oh! Hey Jim! Wow, I Can Tell By Looking At It That It Sounds Great. I%u2019ll Just File This In *The Cultural Bin* For Later. Keep Up The Good Work! <br/> 
 <strong>Reporter:</strong>  Hey, thanks! So, uh, when do you think you%u2019ll run it? <br/> 
 <strong>Editor:</strong>  Oh don%u2019t worry, Jim, it%u2019s filed. <br/> 
 <strong>Reporter:</strong>   Right, but when are you%u2014 <br/> 
 <strong>Editor:</strong>   <em>It%u2019s Filed.</em> <br/>

      I am of low mind. I have several Bright Eyes albums, but I have not heard a single Bob Dylan song besides "Blowin' in the Wind". I am not at all concerned about this state of affairs, though perhaps I'd be more tempted to remedy it if the people who were always going on about Bob Dylan weren't the same ones who look and talk as if they're intravenously hooked up to Pitchfork.

      Hmmm, I guess the Dylan oeuvre is a vast and mighty river.  Where to dip your ear?  I'd recommend the very first one, self-titled, "Bob Dylan" from 1962.  It is full of energy and charm, and his "House of the Rising Son" is fabulous.  His first album with a rock band, "Highway 61 Revisited" is also genius.  (And yes, I colleced these as they came out.)  If you like historic flat-picked folk, two from the 1990s where he does ancient and classic tunes are "Good as I Been to You," and "Word Gone Wrong."  One of those has "Black Jack Davie," and amazing Elizabethan type epic.

      In return I will recommend the PJ Harvey cover of "Highway 61 Revisited" and the White Stripes cover of "One More Cup of Coffee" and maybe even the Sheryl Crow cover of "Mississippi" if you're up to it.  <br/>

      I'm on it, grl.  Thanks for the transgenerational (that's not  <em>trans<strong>gender</strong></em> , you lurkers) music tips.  Dylan's songs often do much better when others cover them.  "One More Cup of Coffee" is a fave, and one I have performed myself, although only to a cat or two.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Oh Sister" just came to mind, another haunting one.

      I think this is a good place to plug the achewood chat again. I feel it's necessary, because we have a good community of regulars going already, but just not enough. Tekende and Margaret and mira and farqussus and all the rest of you who are slowly becoming regulars, back me up. There are even achewood fans in the chat that don't post on assetbar who have found it through other strange and unsettling ways. Download mIRC, folks, type in /server slashnet.irc and /join #achewood. We are having a grand old time, and I will assign a random word to your name that kicks you out of the chat any time anybody says it. This is not an optional feature.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Okay, for anybody who notices, yes, I am aware that I posted this about halfway up the asset once already. But with 650 posts and building fast, I honestly feel I need to place this at least twice on the asset if I want more than a couple people to see it randomly before there's a new asset tomorrow. So, i'm sorry for double posting, but at least i'm not doing it unintentionally like cromar.
