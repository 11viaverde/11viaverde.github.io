      Uhhhhh...what? <br/> 
First off, this is a bit of a non sequitur, ern't it? <br/> 
Secondly, there are many, many places on the internet where you can spend the entire afternoon arguing in anonymity.  These places include IRC chats, forums, message boards, and image boards like 4chan.  And, of course, Assetbar, easily.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Threesly, you imply that Assetbarians can't spell or use grammar?  This is...very inaccurate.  Just look up and down the board. There are very talented writers here!  Unfortunately I'm not one of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, yeah...don't spam our Assetbar, please.

      Lord, it's doubly nauseating. A snide comment about correct spelling and grammar, then a cringy attempt to sound learned by pretending that 'forum' needs a Latin declension. <br/> 
Getting it ass backwards is just the icing on the bile-cake. <br/> 
 <br/> 
psssst! Den Mother! "Forum" is singular!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, the main justification for the overall pissy attitude on touamb is ... what? The original board went away, they started another one, then assetbar started hosting comments and ... what? How is this a source of (and forgive the term, but it seems utterly appropriate in this instance) butthurt? Were the refugees hoping for some sort of prize or prodigal happening? I'm genuinely mystified.

Anyway, upon looking at the thread on touamb that ensued following jay-ell's above-copied-post, all I can say is, holy shit, there are some assholes on touamb.  Setting aside whatever prejudice and animosity these people may have towards other groups such as assetbar, and there is some of that, these people are just plain outright dicks to each other.  I don't feel the least bit insulted anymore about how they treated me.  I realize now it's nothing personal, they are just dicks -- not all of them, but a good portion of them. <br/>

Yeah, of what I've seen, they are dicks, and that's all can be said, really.  I guess they are more threatened by the more popular, more official board than we are by the quiet more private board.  But it really doesn't make a difference, since we don't really have to deal with them.  No need to declare war with Canada.

      shit I didn't expect to exacerbate any conflict between touamb and assetbar to this extent if at all, but I guess sometimes the best trolling is on accident.  I'll take what I can get. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will say that there is this phenomenon whereby many if not most people (myself included) seem to acquire a tunnel vision and invest our writing with far more strength and narcissism than if were speaking with our audience, and likewise we interpret the written word of others as much stronger in meaning than if we were listening to the same person speak instead these words.  I'm sure that if the various parties with various negative ideas about each other were to hang out in person, they would probably get along just fine, although, who knows, maybe some of us have been dicks on the internet for so long that it's warped our personae to where we would even be dicks to each other in person.  <br/>

      Its almost worrying how much I've taken to heart their implication that the level of discourse here on the 'Bar is somehow lower than theirs. What, just 'cause you're on a standard BBS-style messageboard where one can make a 2000-word post and not look like a tool? You show me one tangential anecdote written by someone with a greater degree of talent than Spinynorman, or a piece of Photoshopped Buggery which comes close to somethig that Edwell would spend a sunny afternoon throwing together, and maybe I'll take that kind of shit from you. <br/>

      Something's been on my mind since this little discussion came up: why in frig do we give two shits what touamb thinks about us?  They clearly don't care what we think of them, and we're  not bothering each other.  They're not an army of trolls and spammers, consistently trying to bring assetbar down.  Ignoring each other is 1000x easier than holding discourses on The Touamb Question.  How it's come to that, I'll never know.

      I must speak up and say this sort of stuff is not Assetbar. It is a place where people try to make the wittiest comment they can (preferably with avatar synergy) and step back and let the chubbies roll in. They tend not to act like other internet people. Assetbar is criticism of a comic like two dudes on a couch making fun of a movie they love while passing a j is criticism of movies: it only counts if it's funny and in the end everybody is just here to be entertained. And that is as simple as it gets. Please leave this woman alone and keep Assetbar as God intended it.

      I've got no beef with toumb, but I do think it is sort of funny that the most conversation they've had in years comes from threads about Assetbar.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, feeling  <em>so cheesed</em>  about the creator of a webcomic deciding not to have a message board after awhile--and then changing his mind--is a little weird.  For example, x-entertainment (a website) used to have a message board, years and years ago.  It was closed, 'too much effort'.  No one cried and hated it when the comment section of his blog became a sort of electronic conveyance means.  So, I don't know...If Assetbar closed, which could happen, I'd just post somewhere else (hopefully where some of you people were) and """""get over it""""". <br/> 
 <br/> 
Especially  <em>years later</em> .  You wouldn't catch me, suede patches on my keyboard, typing up some manic screed about how betrayed you felt by the guy with the cat cock comic.

      I was barked at by a dude in a motor vehicle when I was drunk last Friday.  I then had an involved discussion with the gentlemen I was with whether this meant I am a dog.  They said no, it indicated that I was sexually appealing.  I then went on to intimate that the gentleman in question was attracted to me because we both wore glasses.  This conversation, in retrospect, is faintly amusing to me.

      I dunno, gobs, you know you're my homegirl, but I disagree with you here.  I'm as much a real girl conversing with other real people here as if we were all in the same room, or same city, or same state, or same country.  This is all the same room, and honest people are just as real here as they would be face to face.  I don't see much distinction between "in real life" and "online".  Maybe that's because I'm the same person in real life as I am online.  No masks, no fronts, no facades, no lies, no fallacies.  And especially once a relationship between two people that was held exclusively online turns into a phone call, say, or a quick check-in via Facebook to say "hi", that's a real person and a real relationship, to me.  I call greenkoolayd my friend, not my internet friend.  Even if he and I never meet face to face, he's as much a part of my life and as much of a friend of mine as the friend who's sitting five feet from me right now and coming over to my house for dinner tomorrow night. <br/>

      'real life' is simply a place where interaction involves different senses (inputs) and different ways to communicate (outputs) such as body language and physical touch.  Interactive I/O is also higher bandwidth in real life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Having said that, in either place - real life or cyberspace - we find that the experience is different for different people.  Case in point:  Some people just don't like Meat Loaf, and some do. <br/>

      main difference I think between real life and cyberworld is that in real life it takes space aliens with special space/time guns or similar like in that one episode of the twilight zone for reality to be selectively edited, whereas, in cyberspace, all it takes is a myopic dope with admin privs.  That's what I don't like about TOUAMB.COM.  That's actually the only thing I don't like about it.

      Once upon a time a computer was by-in-large a computer.  Now there are dozens upon dozens of fairly complete computer-esque architectures nestled within and about one another, like a mess of Babushka dolls dropped in a blender.  Every year, making this shit work becomes more and more like being an archaeologist trying to piece together broken pottery shards and decode a lost language from a now extinct culture that never made that much sense to begin with.  I'm certified as a computer tech AND a quality inspector.  Any idiot can get such certifications, but I like to think that I'm smarter than the average bear.

      attention please this is a heart felt post <br/> 
 <br/> 
so my little brother died when I was a kid it was kind of a bummer <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was very sad and I depressed and I stop playing on the sports. <br/> 
 <br/> 
but then I have idea I decide I play sports for inspiration of my little dead brother <br/> 
 <br/> 
and I feel not depressed so much and I do okay at the sports <br/> 
 <br/> 
but after some years come and pass I forget memory of little brother what he look like and so on because I was so little when he died i don't rmember much anymore <br/> 
 <br/> 
and all the videos of little brother get erased when daddy want to video tape his porn from the pay per view <br/> 
 <br/> 
then later on in college i have good friend we fuck a lot but then she get pregnant so i break up and pretend it not my baby, but she thinking maybe it is me the father. <br/> 
 <br/> 
so I'm thinking oh man how do I cheat on a dna test <br/> 
 <br/> 
but then it worked out in the end my friend she dies of cancer it is pretty fucked up.  So the frat boy that fucked her got stuck with the kid and i was so happy and so sad also simultaniesly.   so then i say i am going to graduate from the college because of motivation of my girl friend who died of the cancer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
so secret of my success is make friends with people who has the terminal illnesses.  internet is great for finding such people they have chat rooms they even have dating sites for people with aids.  I have to tell little gay lie say I have aids when I don't, but I make many friends this way of course i don't fuck them I just say 'well i'm not attracted to you because you look different in person than on the site but can we still be friends' and then I have new friends to motivate me.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
one thing with this method is don't wait for friend to die before you go look for another aids friend because aids people can sometimes take too long years to die so stock up in advance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
is true what they say people with aids and such diseases really can make a difference.

      I think this is a general trait of his.  When the guys are acting like a bunch of first rate fools, his party-poopery is accepted and welcomed by us, because someone's got to put the boys straight.  But when we're as intrigued by the shenanigans as Ray or T or Beef, we're a little annoyed when Connie plays the cunt.  Overall, he's rarely on board with the things the guys do.  The Bad Ass Games and Stoned Lightning are the only things that come to mind that current day Connie would sniff and furrow his brow at.  I was surprised when he started writing the Strip book.  And that's all odd considering the reasoning behind the Boffin episode is pretty logical: give the old guy something to entertain his mind with.  Yet we normally see him Walter Matthauing it up.

      I honestly can't remember the taste.  Last time I had it I was well along the way and it was a whole long time ago now anyway.  I guess the ol' "fruity ass shit" thing holds water, but I don't care enough to defend it.  I just drink whatever is presented to me usually.  I'm young enough where that's still something to do 99% of the time (absinthe falling under the 1% of the time you don't do that but hey, live and learn).

      There are lots of drinks that I would be scornful of because they are artificial, pointlessly sweet, or, to be honest, because I am a massive snob. But Southern Comfort isn't just a cloying, mass produced liquor tasting of sugar. It has a flavour that is genuinely depressing. Imagine an old orange, who has turned to drink. His family has drifted away from him. He was made redundant at 55 and now he has nothing to do but sit around and knock back whisky. He is in a pub, ordering his second of the day at ten to twelve. He still stinks of booze from the night before. Suddenly through the door walks his ex wife and her new husband, to ask for directions. They look over and see the unshaven orange in the corner, and he sees them. Imagine taking a bite out of that orange. That is how southern comfort tastes.
