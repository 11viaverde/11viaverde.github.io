      They are up until the point they fuck up bad, anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perfect example:  My two friends, let's call them B and T, skipped school one fine morning after first period and went over to B's house with mischief on the mind.  This mischief manifested itself in a half-full can of gasoline poured in a pattern on B's driveway (full view of the neighbors), and lit on fire.  Hooting and hollering commenced, until B noticed something... gas had splashed onto his pant leg and the fire was doing what fire inevitably does.  For a full minute these two gibbering gibbons were trying everything they could to get that goddamned fire out, from trying to unzip the leg of B's convertible pants to nearly dumping B into a wheelbarrow that, for some reason or another,  <em>was filled with half water/half kerosense mix.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I pause to swear to you that I am not making this shit up.  How the hell could I? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Eventually, and they never told me how, they extinguished the flame and got B's Dad and the hospital on the horn.  Completely oblivious, I wandered by later in the day, had the whole story related to me and, though the tale itself was, is, and always will be dubious, the results were not: Third degree burns  <em>all</em>  up and down that dude's calf and a stench that could choke a yak every time he changed the bandages, about three times a day.  The painkillers, tho, were awesome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To this day, B has never lit something on fire without a reason, and is the first to speak up when someone isn't paying a flame the respect it deserves.

      My uncle Kevin had something like that happen to him. Playing around with an old junked stove he found, spilled some gas on his pants. 3rd degree burns over 75% of his legs.
