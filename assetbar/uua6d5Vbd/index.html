      Nooooo wayyyyyy. Touch typing taught me absolutely nothing, and i type fine. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cursive, on the other hand, enables you to get legible thoughts down as fast as you could type them on a computer. (I almost typed "FASTER", but then i thought, now they'll all say "Aaah so you SHOULD have learned touch-typing.") <br/> 
 <br/> 
I recall the shudders of horror that always passed through me when my sister, at age 18, would be scrawling notes with the penmanship of a six-yeard-old. Even the dots on the "i"'s where, like, little filled-in circles. Don't tell me they need to de-prioritise basic handwriting skills. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And what about attending lectures at uni? You learn about ten times more writing it all down by hand than by typing on a laptop. Thats personal experience, but i'm sure there are studies backing it up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And maths. Sure, you don't need cursive with maths, but we ought to have SOME experience "making signs with drawing sticks" in order to be at all competent with maths skills. Maths at it's most basic levels is something you absolutely cannot learn on a computer, you need to write it down. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now iPhone typing... that's just a whole other skillset. Seriously those things were designed by people who have never owned mobile phones. I assume they all live on the Apple campus and have no need to ever be called by anybody in the real world.

      I have never been able to cursive write faster than my printing. And I print as fast or faster than your average cursive writer. Neither comes close to touching my typing speed.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, I agree that being able to write is important, but I think printing is totally sufficient for everything that cursive can do. Hen-peck typing is rarely as sufficient as touch-typing.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
To use university as an example, touch-typing is crucial for long papers. It can save you literally hours when you're copying from hand-jotted research/drafts, typing quotes from books, etc. I think cursive's advantage over printing is a much smaller gap. That's why I think typing ability is more important than cursive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am not arguing against all forms of writing by hand, I just think that one style is plenty, and cursive is harder to learn, less common to read, and doubtfully better than printing.

      Hand writing is a thing of the past, and we oldies just have to accept that. As a primary language teacher, this pains me a great deal to admit, since it was a big part of my education. But basically, all you need your handwriting for these days is to sign papers. And that too will probably soon be from history. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, having a fast and somewhat readable handwriting will let you use  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000031/https://www.amazon.co.uk/Livescribe-4GB-Titanium-Pulse-Smartpen/dp/B002DJTMSW/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=officeproduct&amp;qid=1282382258&amp;sr=8-3">this cool thing.</a>

      terribleman it pains me that a teacher would say that! I'm not an oldie (well, 29 - but the point is i am firmly a part of the ridiculously-computer-literate generation), and i totally disagree. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think you're missing the value of handwriting in everyday life! I use it constantly. I have an iPhone, two PDAs, one PC, a regular laptop and a netbook running Ubuntu, and i know how to use all them (and do so fluidly throughout the day), but i still find that writing by hand is an essential basic skill. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In lectures, in my post-grad research, at work. Just through all those little things throughout the day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Labeling DVDs, labeling specimens, producing diagrams, making quick records of fossil specimens (**absolutely** essential for the research work i do), sorting out my thoughts, writing down phone numbers and having them quickly accessible on my desk, leaving notes for the next people in my shift, taking notes in lectures. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It would take longer, be less useful, and be unnecessarily complicated to do any of these things in electronic form. Please don't tell your students that handwriting is a thing of the past! I don't know what I would do with them after they come through our palaeontology course and end up being almost useless in the field due to a lack of handwriting ability!

      You use handwriting constantly, you say, but you are almost as old as I am, so I'm gonna fix you in the same category as myself: The dudes who grew up in a school system where handwriting was very important. When I was in school, we were graded for our handwriting. That is a thing of the past. Fact. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course I don't tell my students that they shouldn't know how to write. But handwriting in our times is mainly used for your own eyes only, so it doesn't need to be pretty, like earlier. If people want to develope a nice handwritng so they can make their christmas cards more personal, of course I won't stop them. But is it essential? Not really. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My students label their DVDs with a printer. They produce diagrams on the computer, they send phone numbers to each other, rather than writing them down. They take notes on a laptop and send text messages rather than leaving little yellow post-its. <br/> 
What we old timers think is too complicated to do electronically may not be so for the teen of this age. And it is this teen who's gonna grow up to attend your palaeontology class in ten years. And when some of them become teachers themselves, they are going to teach what  <em>they</em>  think is easier, not what we did in old times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I may have been a little vague in my earlier post. Of course I recognize hand writing as an essential part of learning how to read (and write), and I know that taking notes with a pencil help some of us remember better. Everyone who can type also know how to write by hand. All I'm saying is, it is becoming less and less important.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As technology progresses, so do its uses. And kids have a much easier time adapting to this stuff than us. So when you say that note taking and all the other stuff is faster by hand, you are saying that it is easier for  <em>you</em> . Lots of my young students would disagree with you already. Imagine what they'll say in ten years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I use handwriting every day and will continue to do so for the rest of my life, I think. It is how I was programmed. Yet I see the signs. I see the the things I deem essential are, in fact, not. I see the digital age creeping up on you and me in the form of our children, and we need to hang on tight if we want to keep up with them.

...No, i do all of those things competently (i don't know how to prove this, except to say that i use all this stuff at maximum efficiency, where the bottleneck is in the computer, not the user), and i find all them faster with handwriting. "Should i list my specimens in an excel file? No way, that'll take at least an extra 30 seconds. Time is precious." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just cannot agree with your sentiments re: "the digital age creeping up on us" - and i've seen that sentiment a lot. In fact, i'm pretty sure my generation has been exposed to that since we were toddlers - it's all just empty hype. I'm telling you, i'm more than competent with computers, better than the average of people younger than me. The idea of a "digital world" just seems like empty hype to me (although this touches on a whole bunch of other issues - including the hyping of the "information revolution" by companies who happen to trade in information technology, and find it useful to buy shallow editorials in technology magazines on this point). The idea of an illiterate culture, however, seems more likely - literacy levels are a slippery thing to begin with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it's mostly a baby-boomer/Gen-X sentiment, though you telling me that we're around the same age threw me a bit. But i swear to you, this is not from a perspective of "Oh all those young folk doing away with things i thought were important" - this is from a perspective of "Oh, all those old folk not really understanding what 'digital' technology really is, and thinking the world is shifting on it's axis for some reason".

      we have to remember too that literacy is a recent thing. Our great great grandparents probably didn't read well, if they were working class, and their grandparents might not have been readers at all. Education of all children is an egalitarian ideal often tied to socialist movements (the USSR, for all its faults, did basically create Russian popular literacy out of whole cloth) but also used by modernising conservatives (Bismarck instituted the first state education system to give Germany an industrial edge). It seems to me that some trends in politics could benefit from lowered access to information, to the detriment of us all.

      Just to clarify some points: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"What we old timers think is too complicated to do electronically may not be so for the teen of this age. And it is this teen who's gonna grow up to attend your palaeontology class in ten years" <br/> 
 <br/> 
- I would hope not, a person who can't quickly jot things down would not be useful in the field. Although i take a laptop into the field with me, it's only for keeping at wherever base camp is: rain and dust and a lack of re-charging ability would do it in fairly quickly. (People of all ages generally use greylead for field notebooks, in fact, because ink runs.) And the notes aren't just for you (although its best practise to type them up when you get back for the day - assuming you are doing work somewhere luxurious enough to have a powerpoint), especially when you're labeling specimens. Field conditions are conditions where you cannot expect anything to work, you have to make do with whatever is available, and you have to be able to devise systems of record keeping and map-making and keeping track of information that are not going to result in you being completely stranded by, for example, being unable to get at the information you put onto a hard-disk. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not saying this as a technophobe. GPS (not the kitschy iPhone "GPS", which i'm pretty sure doesn't even use the GPS network) and digital cameras and, when there is a powerpoint, the ability to backup all your photos: all extremely useful. (And i do notice differences between me and the older workers. I, for example, am much more aware of the fact that there is essentially no reason not to snap a field picture of absolutely everything, whereas some other researchers seem to have the idea of conserving "film" ingrained into them. I'll take an afternoon to stitch several large field maps of differing scales together on computer, an older researcher will sit down and laboriously make use of sticky tape and tracing paper to achieve the effect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So it's not "new versus old" that i'm preaching, its "having as broad a range of competencies as possible", and legible and quick writing skills are a part of that that's overlooked simply because it's so basic. That's what literacy and numeracy are all about, when it comes down to it - the basic skills that should be so fundamentally a part of the software of any human being that nobody even thinks about it past high school. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Everyone who can type also know how to write by hand" - i question that, based on anecdotal evidence. My sister (now early twenties) types fairly normally, but she cannot write in a way that's really legible to most other people. She writes like someone in early primary school - i don't mean this as hyperbole: it's actually pretty disconcerting, and it's striking enough that most people would say there is a degree to which she is illiterate.

      I touch type everything on a daily basis.  However, when I sit down to actually produce original ideas that I care about (i.e. not work), I still hand write them.  I cannot explain it, but typing does not work nearly as well when you are trying to be creative.

      I see your point re: cursive versus printing; if i could print as fast as i could curse, i would probably agree. So perhaps i should be arguing that cursive be retained because different people get the best results from different techniques. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In a similar vein, though, you're contrasting touch-typing with hen-peck-typing. In practice, i've never seen anybody use either method outside of the classroom itself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't hunt-and-peck (except on my iphone), but i don't touch-type either. Touch-typing always slows me down, and within a few words my hands seem to free themselves and speed up to the 60 words-per-minute range (i just tested myself online then to find a realistic figure, so don't take that figure as my official stat).

      Cursive is completely useless. Most of 4th grade was learning and practicing cursive. After 4th grade I never wrote a single thing in cursive for the rest of my life. <br/>

And on occasion I have to read someone else's cursive and it's utterly illegible.

      The only way I got through all those exams at school and uni was through cursive writing.  Unless they now conduct exams with some sort of bolted-down laptop with no USB port or something, I can't imagine anyone getting through a time-critical writing assessment exercise without cursive script.  I also touch-type just fine.

      That message was written by Ray drunk out of his mind. He went to tell Teodor about a spider, but Teodor wasn't there. So he clumsily wrote "HELP" on the window sill to remind Teodor to help the spider out instead of killing it. This is the kind of cat Ray is. <br/>

      I want to go on record here as saying I'm happy with this ENTIRE arc so far. So many people have been naysaying the creepy chapter, but I think the idea was suspense and what's more, I think it worked and is working beautifully. This comic became what it is by being difficult sometimes. If you're honest about yourself as an achewood fan(c'mon), you must recognize the little bit which is proud of yourself for having slogged through the excruciating parts and the drawn-out storylines and reached the payoff of understanding the characters well enough to  <em>get</em>  all the character-driven gags nowadays. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's what's been going on this year. It was awesome and it's still awesome. It's gonna be more palatable to more people now that the forces of good are moving faster and shit is getting real, but we have been learning about the characters through a series of huge, life-altering situations all year.  <br/>

      He means "Promethean" as in "have the forethought" to leave flowers, as Emeril startled him half to death. Prometheus: Ancient Greek, "Forethought."

      You've both been chubbied for this, but I really don't see the etymological connection. The kind of dictionary I read suggests Promethean means daring, original or some such. This makes sense, as Prometheus was the guy who stole fire from the gods, and got his liver eaten out again and again for his troubles. This story says 'daring' yes, but not so much 'foresight' - unless he had always been angling for some eternal torture.

      Forgive me for saying this but you are coming across as a bit of a dick. People who know things are telling you a fact about the etymology of the name Prometheus which casts a ready light on both Mr Bear's language and the myth itself. You seem ready to challenge their assertions on the scantiest of evidence.

      This is actually a pretty interesting point of lexacology. The  <em>name</em>  Prometheus is derived from two Greek words that, combined, do indeed approximately mean "forethought".  And that, I am pretty darn sure, is what Connie had in mind.  However, the word Promethean  has a meaning that derives not for the meaning of Prometheus' name, but from the story of his actions.  That is why the correct definition of Promethean is "boldly daring or original".  It doesn't really fit as used by Connie in this strip.  wjon raises a valid and interesting point and should be apologized to.  Except for this: He humbled under and lost his easement.

      I actually think wjon makes a good point; the connection between Prometheus' name and his nature is a bit more complex than that of his brother, Epimetheus, who tended not to think ahead, but only realised his mistakes afterwards.

      That's another thing. WHY are the images off? Ain't we all adults or man childs here? WAS it some ass waggin his tiny dick all over the place? IS THAT WHAT CAUSED THIS PROBLEM? Was there some problem with trade marks being misappropriated or sensibilities being offended? WE ARE discussing a 'comic' that of late has dealt with a homicidal cat battering an old homosexual and a preference questioning bear along with lawn doody, illiterate trash, and Denny's. I don't know what your nightmares are made of, but god damn I think I can handle whatever picture, image or vision Hamscout has crafted with his or her paws, hands or via assist chimp and as an AMERICAN, (back off here hatstand, go queen-tipping or whatever you brits do when you're not dissolving the empire)I DEMAND ON BEHALF OF ENTERTAINMENT SEEKING AMERICANS that images be ON!

      images are off because people kept using them to call URLs that weren't images, using it as an attack vector on assetbar, and whoever made assetbar decided it was easier to turn off images than to fix any of the security weaknesses in assetbar.  If you notices a lot of people's status is 'rb was here.'  that was done by someone (not me) with the help of the images.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
anyway, if you want images, turn on your TV.  I like that images are off.  It really improves the quality of the content on here.  Things have improved greatly since images broke.

      no, they actually fixed those exploits.  disabling the images was a reaction to another exploit by someone else.  You're giving me too much credit.  my exploits were not as sophisticated as the ones that followed by this other person. <br/>

      Ray is just the sort of dude who has four or five beds throughout his house, each for a different purpose. This is his "drunk bed," a bed without the bells and whistles of, say, the "bone bed"; but, most importantly, it happens to be located in the darkest room of the house. Given Ray's lifestyle, it is the bed most commonly featured.

      I think you'll find he was attempting to write a history of Miles, as in Frank Miles, the bisexual Victorian portrait artist, and putative suspect in the Jack the Ripper murders. Philippe presents a convincing and passionate defence of Miles as a draughtsman and artist, but his understanding of the archived materials is sometimes shaky, and much of the autobiographical detail has been better covered elsewhere. However, we should be tolerant of these small flaws because he is five.

      It's all become so clear in the 'fore-noon light. Onstad was going through some rough chuckles and wasn't sure if he had what amounted to talent anymore at all so he spent a few weeks studiously producing putrid comics so as to heighten the effect on the senses of the end of the arc to an extreme degree, thus producing what will come to be called probably his masterwork once all the pixel-shavings have settled and we are left to talk such things out among ourselves in the faded livingrooms of mid-twenty-first century online chats.

The truth: These 'Achwardian' characters are reincarnations of the A-Team.  <br/>

And meanwhile, Mr. Bear's internal dialog is reminiscing fondly about Polly, possibly with these lyrics... <br/> <br/> <br/> <em>She came in through the bathroom window<br/>
Protected by a silver spoon<br/>
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders<br/>
By the banks of her own lagoon<br/>
<br/>
Didn't anybody tell her?<br/>
Didn't anybody see?<br/>
Sunday's on the phone to Monday,<br/>
Tuesday's on the phone to me<br/>
<br/>
She said she'd always been a dancer<br/>
She worked at 15 clubs a day<br/>
And though she thought I knew the answer<br/>
Well I knew but I could not say.<br/>
<br/>
And so I quit the police department<br/>
And got myself a steady job<br/>
And though she tried her best to help me<br/>
She could steal but she could not rob.</em> <br/>

This arc was cool but now is just turning into Standard Shenanigans: Roast Beef being a man of action, Cornelius having old man secrets, Ray delivering us from evil. <br/>

      Fair call.  We've seen this development before, because it works for the audience.  Always an artistic tension - keeping it real vs bread and circuses.  Although meanwhile, who cares?  I was kind of stunned by the revelation this has arc has developed over four months or something.  Bizarre how your perception of time changes according to the part of your brain engaged with different activities - four months is forever in day-to-day life, in Achewood it's one long, tortuous evening in the back of Nice Pete's van.

      The idea of an Ip Man biopic originated in 1998 when Jeffrey Lau and Corey Yuen discussed the idea of making a film based on the band Wang Chung's 1982 #2 hit "Everybody Have Fun Tonight."  Through symbolism, the film follows the trials and tribulations of a band denied the #1 spot by the fucking Bengals ("Walk Like an Egyptian".)  The film explores this story mostly via following the story of Yip Kai-man, a grandmaster of the martial art Wing Chun and the first person to teach the art of "egyptian-walk fighting"  <em>(citation needed)</em>  a style similar to drunken boxing only egyptian-walk involves channeling the ghost of glyph (aka "Prince.")  The film makes extensive use of computerized CGI effects and overseas call center workers to make it seem as if the soundtrack has been poorly dubbed by non-fluent English-speaking jagoffs.  There is some controversy  <em>(who?)</em>  with many critics complaining that this computerized lip-desynching gives the film an 'artificial' feel. <br/>

      You fuckin' A.   That's that dude Ronny I used to score from.  He was always laughing like that cause his shit was cut to hell, but we kept buying it.  He had a way of making you feel like you were in on the joke while at the same time he was burning you.  I think he finally made enough to buy some business he was always talking about.  I never believed that part of the story - he always played it real vague as to exactly what the business was, but he did disappear one day, and was never heard from again, even by the dudes who owed him money.  Not me of course.  I had just paid him off.  Of course.

      Chapter 1: The evolution of smiles :) <br/> 
 <br/> 
The smile was invented millions of years ago when primitive apes decided to show they were happy by putting fruit in their mouths. After a while they got tired of carrying fruit around all the time and decided it would be easier just to make a banana shape with their lips instead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chapter 2: Historical smiles :) <br/> 
 <br/> 
The most beautiful smile in history belonged to Mildred Danforth, 124 Collins St., Rockville, Connecticut. (My library book told me Mrs. Danforth would show you her smile for a nickel, but the internet said she died in 1961. The internet is a pretty big spoilsport.) On a related note: skeletons always look like they are smiling, because you can see all of their teeth! (See also; Chapter 5) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chapter 3: Modern smiles :) <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are over 18 kinds of smiles today! You can use a smile to say hello, or to pretend that you understand what someone is saying. There are even more smiles that you can type on the computer. :) =D =) :D ^_^  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chapter 4: Smile biology :) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Smiles that don't try very hard only take 5 muscles, but really BIG ones can use up to 53! So if you are feeling very tired you should probably only smile a little. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The end!

      1. Yes <br/> 
2. Yes. New content gets added to the Champagne Room with a frequency roughly correlating to updates of the main comic, so it's been a little thin lately. The content we do get is awesome though. If you're considering signing up, I'd suggest giving it a try and just working your way through the 800-entry backlog. There's some truly great stuff in there. I don't know if you can go month-to-month, I think the minimum purchase is 3 months for $9.00, but I swear on the soul of your child those nine bucks will buy you more entertainment than any other nine dollar entertainment transaction you might be considering.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
One question. Off topic, I know...but bear with me.  <br/> 
1. I know lots of other countries use "dollars", but are they colloquially referred to as "bucks" anywhere besides the United States? Is that just our deal? <br/>

      the GUI is different and I think actually more cumbersome and lame than the free assetbar...  The lame system is different...   your account gets blocked from posting for 24 hours each time any of your posts gets a lame, except the first 2 lames on a post don't block your account.  I don't subscribe anymore because I never could stand the GUI, and also the lame system enforces a disgusting level of conformity and group think. <br/>

      It looks to me like a comic con goer cosplaying Ray. Also, what kind of player would sleep in a bed that small? Is it a "There ain't no room to snuggle" sort of thing?

      It appears Soticoto has reared his head. Back in the day, he was one of the worst trolls on the website, and I do not begrudge the lady if she feels like responding to the prat's comeback rather than posting in the now.

      It happens to the old timers, as I'm now experiencing.  Not that I'm a heccibiggs or even a soticoto, but I've basically read none of the comments on these last two strips, and I'm not missing it.  The only reason I read this is because I did a ctrl f search to see if anyone had mentioned soticoto's unexpected return. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not that I don't still check assetbar - I have like 20 soticoto responses from the past week in my inbox.  In fact, I've always kind of liked how some of the older regulars mostly swing the archives: heccibiggs, tekende, rowboat, et al.

      Same here, actually. I don't read comments on the new strips much anymore. I do still visit though, and did notice a glut of Soticoto responses in my inbox. I couldn't figure out why until I remembered that I'd lamed a lot of his comments when I was reading through Achewood the first time because he got on my nerves. Apparently, he just noticed this and believes I am a tasteless hypocrite who should die.  <br/>

I have assumed, up until now, that everyone in the northern hemisphere had the same basic season/month-ratio, I mean 3 month per season works well in a temperate zone like mine, but now I see that I may have been mistaken. <br/>

      No, it's not a racist thought.  You just mistook his meaning.  Actual seasons are a function of the tilt and rotation of the Earth and it's distance from the sun at the time.  We may call things a rainy season, monsoon season, or hurricane season, but this does not make them actual seasons in the true sense of the word.  They are, as he said, simply weather patterns. <br/>

      What can I say.  Been here since 2002.  I used to love Achewood.  Sent Onstad many dollars I could not really afford to spend but I believed in Achewood so hard I sent them anyway.  Got some very nice notes from him in return.  I will always wish him the best, because he IS the best. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nice Pete is the anti-Achewood.  Nice Pete makes every strip he has ever appeared in worse than terrible.  Nice Pete is an encouragement to suicide.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Here is how the current arc should end.  But probably won't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray:  Nice Pete, we have given you at least ten times more forgiveness than a dog turd, yet you have still insisted you are a dog turd. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nice Pete: Oh Ray, you have judged my friendship wanting.  I have not passed your friendship test.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray:  You have not even tried to do anything, Nice Pete. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nice Pete:  At this point, my nonexistant high school life would insist, Ray, that you EAT MY SHORTS. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray:  Fine, Pete, fine.  But you must first (whips out flame-thrower) EAT HOT HOT. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Ray sprays napalm all over Nice Pete, and ignites it, and Nice Pete bursts into flame, screaming horribly over at least six panels as he dissolves into charred bones.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray:  Okay, Beef, Emeril. I got some eco-trash bags in the Escalade.  Get Pete's crap into them, and we'll drive him to the town dump.  Nice Pete will finally get to be the hometown boy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Goodbye, everyone.  I love Achewood, and believe it or not, I love you too.

      I actually don't hate Nice Pete at all. That one strip from back in the good 'old days, where he's like, "These are their hands."...I love that one. Its brief, its clever, the timing is amazing. As good as the timing on the Isosceles Lock strip. Genius. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is a HUGE difference between that and locking a character naked in the back of a van for a month of strips while he sucks the world's biggest  cock and awaits his own violent murder and mutilation. Not funny to anyone who isn't a real life Nice Pete, and it has NO timing at all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This arc is going to have to have the most amazing ending in the history of story telling in order to not be the worst thing ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hear Twisted Pictures is accepting scripts for Saw IX...might be a good thing since Onstad seems to have lost interest in Achewood.

      The strip in which Pete sustains a scream for - what was it? 8 seconds, I think? - has been a source of inspiration to me.  <br/> 
It doesn't seem in character for anybody else to have shared an anecdote in which they did this to someone. <br/> 
Would Pete have worked in the G.O.F. arc?

      1st. did you know it was still Friday? neither did I. <br/> 
B. Big controversy over the question of 'which is the most nutritious' cut of meat? Todd says sploaded? <br/> 
THEN! What is it between spell-check and Todd? Most people say things that can be spelled. <br/> 
Ray says it's not the cut it's the presentation. But I think he likes cake more. (who doesn't?) <br/> 
Lyle thinks it's tube steak but Teodor says forget that I heard that, and Pat says none. <br/> 
Hmmmm Pete says presentation too but I think he means something different from Ray?  <br/> 
Did you know that spell-check thinks that Hmmmmm means humus?  <br/> 
What's humus? <br/> 
Sorry. This is supposed to be Friday facts, not Friday questions. <br/> 
FACTS! <br/> 
I said hmmmmm.  <br/> 
It's still Friday but I don't understand everything. <br/> 
Mr Bears name is Connie but he's a boy. <br/> 
Beef is married to Molly but he's not happy. <br/> 
It's still Friday? <br/> 
Sorry, that was a question. <br/>

      The next strip will never come.  Here's the proof: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"there will be a new strip later Friday (or, you know, the day after what I said)" <br/> 
 <br/> 
He said the new strip would go up on Friday, but then corrected himself to say it would be "the day after what I said"...  A naive interpretation would be that he said the strip would post on Friday, but he corrected himself to say that it would be the day after, on Saturday.  But he -said- the strip would arrive "the day after I said" - which means no matter how many times you apply the "day after" rule, the rule can still be applied further, prolonging the release of the new strip farther into the future.  There will never come a time when today is the same day as tomorrow, so the strip will never be posted.

      I think Onstad is bringing the strip off the page into real life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Roomba Citizen Kane of expanded dimensions" is equivalent to "high school night in a nice van." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"We" are reduced to "Teodor and Nathan." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Put it in the tip jar" means "suck on this giant hog." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad is driving the van, and he just pulled down the armored curtain.  This night will never end.

      Everyone has to abandon an arc every once in a while.  A cheap out is nothing to be ashamed out--it's still an out, and you're up 5-4 with the bases loaded in the 9th.

      Nice Pete could be funny, especially at first, when his naivete about a foot being chopped off was funny...like, how could you do that, and stuff.  But in the last three Nice Pete stories, the humor had gone.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suspect Onstad got a bad tax assessment, or a fight with his wife, or his daughter said, "I like ponies, and you don't draw ponies."  Or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I used to like Roast Beef.  Hell, I identified with Roast Beef.  But then, he told Ray at the end of "Mister Band" not to kill Nice Pete, that Nice Pete would reward Ray with "country ways" or something.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I stopped liking Roast Beef then.  In face, he became an idiot, an a**hole.  He was the scientist in all those monster movies, who when the monster is about to be killed, rushes out and says "No no dude you must not kill the monster you must keep him alive for science." <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you've seen those movies, you know that this decision means that many, many more people get killed because of this idiot scientist.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roast Beef, thanks for getting innocent people killed.  What, you think Nice Pete just goes away between appearances?  Nope, he's been killing babies, puppies, and kittens, all the while smiling wryly.  Snapping their necks while grinning.

      Or - OR - he's like Gandalf suggesting to Frodo that Gollum be left alive because he feels Gollum "may have some future roll to play before this thing is over". <br/> 
In other words, is Beef getting people killed / fellated or is he ... doing philosophy?
