      At my old high school, there was a filter which blocked out everything not pre-approved.  This was in the days prior to Wikipedia, so the only things they had were Britannica.com and other big things like that.  Everything else = no. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I called conspiracy that Mobil.com was allowed, but Shell.com was not.  Particularly because of the school's known good relationship (and sponsoring by) the local Mobil refinery.  I was really begging for controversy.

It is different. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, this pattern of indulgent defenses of people being negative and getting lamed for it now needs it's own rule, a.k.a. Godwin's Law. Seriously. Is it alright for me to enjoy Achewood comments, but to not enjoy reading opinions like "Wow that thing you just read and liked is real crap. I have nothing more to add."? Does every single person with nothing-to-say need to have their lack of contribution defended from lames with gross assumptions about the motives of the lamers? <br/>

Lames do not come with explanations. To assume it is because everyone is just dumber than you is wrongful. <br/>

      Clearly someone has never been to a strip club when it was one stipper's birthday. She seemed to be in it more for the passion than the payment, and asked for nothing regarding advance.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of  course, I am not referencing a personal story here.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, keep in mind that if you are a stripper then you are probably at least somewhat weird sexually, and if you are willing to be paid to be a prom date, you will probably not have that many problems riding Prom Cock in the back of a Jetta. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I am wrong, though, please, let someone speak up.

      Man, if I ever became a stripper, I'd totally make it a habit to go to high school proms. All checkin' IDs to make sure kids are 18, then boning them in the backseat of a Jetta. Just for the stories they'd have to tell later. Well, and the stories I'd get to tell, all sittin' around Strippers Brunch on Sunday morning...tassels and g-strings and croissants everywhere...

      You can't cook a person for nine hours! It will be black and crispy! Besides, if it is 131 pounds, you are either cooking it one the bone, or you are cooking mostly fat.

The internet is pure distilled human condition (this does not excuse its sometimes-loathsomeness but rather explains it). I think Onstad made a successful attempt at providing us a glimpse of a Kid Internet that is pure distilled Kid condition.

      The Eternal Childhood of Philippe the Otter Marches On. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The timeline strip gave me the horrible idea that Philippe is some kind of malignant immortal who gets some kind of (asexual but still horribly creepy) jollies out of pretending to be five. It is either that or he is just the most enthusiastic any boy has ever been about being a child. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He is so used to it he expects a computer with mouse ears and gets indignant when people get mad at him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is a guy who actually does this. He was a major programmer before he decided he was a child. Someone else probably knows who it is.

      From an authorial intent standpoint you've got it exactly right. (I hope - then again, the 'retarded otter' angle suggests maybe it's more complex than all that.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
I loved that one, though, especially the Philippe part. Someone pointed out that that might just be how the characters see their lives going, and that made me a bit happier. But then someone pointed out Philippe in the same panel as Teodor dying - and that Teodor is the one who puts him to bed. That genuinely made me cry. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is almost as cold as Jurassic Bark. Make no mistake, Onstad is pro ice.
