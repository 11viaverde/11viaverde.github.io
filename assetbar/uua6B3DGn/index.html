      So what you are suggesting is that Emo kids did not "evolve" from goths, but rather, in a move somewhat unique in subcultures, is the product of convergent evolution, have evoled from punks to a more gothesque state?

      I agree to a point, in that all rock music has been affected greatly by Punk, but some find themselves closer to older styles, for example, progressive rock(metal) like Tool. It owes much more the pre-punk seventies prog like Pink Floyd ELP or King Crimson. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is notable that Punk itself is a turn away from the progressive style. Punk I think is summed up well with the description "music for people who know that loving your guitar is more important than knowing how to play it." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will freely admit that Progressive can get quite pretentious and overwrought, but I must applaud it for its goal to bring rock to the status of classical music, to make art out of it. Punk, conversely dragged rock back to the garage- simplifying it to power chords, making it so any cocky cocain addict with a guitar can be a star... <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I digress. My previous inquirey had more to do with how far removed emo is from it's punky progenitor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will freely admit <br/>

      I agree.  Any music which can trace its lineage to 'metal' is indeed not one hundred percent in owage to punk, because metal has been around longer.  But to claim that punk didn't effect the way metal evolved as well would be silly.  Like having this discussion seriously on the internet silly.

      Pretty good breakdown, and chubby for mentioning Big Black, but Emo actually came from 80's hardcore punk bands like Rites of Spring and Embrace. I'm surprised more people who care enough to post their very unique and original thoughts on how emo sucks and it's just a bunch of stupid kids crying can't bother to make the quick trip to Wikipedia that obtaining the aforementioned knowledge requires.

      I'm surprised no one's lamed this yet.  This is a dire oversimplification, man.  There was a lot more happening in late 70s rock than punk, and there are plenty of things happening now which haven't evolved from punk.  More accurately, there are a lot of things happening in rock in the late 70s which were NOT punk, but which people seem to insist on labeling punk.  Talking Heads, for instance.

      Hold on, wasn't "punk" based on breaking the conventional compositional standards of rock and blues?  The 16-bar chord patterns?  The idea of melody?  That's how it hit me back then, that you could "punk" any previous form of music, staying with a chord for far longer than even Neil Young, breaking up rhythms, etc.  In that regard, Devo and Talking Heads are punk.

      i take severe offense at about half of what you just said, sir. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Industrial started with Throbbing Gristle, circa 1974 i think?, and has roots in the krautrock movement. <br/> 
Goth was Bauhaus and Joy Division in the beginning, the Misfits really influence psychobilly et.al. just as heavily. <br/> 
Emo: covered elsewhere. <br/> 
Indie: relatively on track, but i have to say a lot of the cadences and melodies harken back to such as even the Beatles and the 13th Floor Elevators. <br/> 
Noise has roots dating back to the 1920s and no-wave artists were primarily influenced by the New Blockaders, Psychic TV, Merzbow, Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, stuff along those lines. Noise has evolved on a trajectory completely separate from these other subgenres, because noise is its own genre. <br/> 
The roots of grunge are side B of Black Flag's My War...and the Melvins. Meat Puppets, Sonic Youth, Vaselines etc. all influenced grunge, but the Melvins and My War are where the sound originated. <br/> 
Nu-metal is so painfully impertinent to this discussion that it hurts, physically. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Metal has been relatively untouched by punk, as have prog and, one could argue, psych-rock (with the exception of the Butthole Surfers and the Flaming Lips-I suggest you check out the Dead C and Gravitar). Overall though I'm pretty sure you're only somewhat informed on this subject, and most of the replies on here have rendered your agrument moot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only aspect of the punk movement which has really permeated through everything is the DIY ethic, which really was a product of a time and place more than anything (70s disenfranchisement, cassette culture, Reagan/Thatcher, etc).  <br/>

      That all seems pretty solid except the part about metal having been "relatively untouched by punk." If those two genres aren't legally wed, they at least live together and have a healthy sexual relationship. Probably engaged, even.

There's no real documentation to get prescriptivist  <em>with.</em>   <br/> <br/> But if you really want references, then The Oxford English Dictionary doesn't mention the plural one way or the other, and UrbanDictionary lists both.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101121051300/https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/emo">Wiktionary</a>  gives the plural as emos.

      When I was a goth we used to go to Denny's at like 5 in the morning after the club closed and would usually have no problem getting seated. The waitress would usually be pretty surly, though. I think she hated having to serve twenty people at once.

      Our high school is four years, freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior.  These high school publish yearboooks, and only the seniors have individual portraits.  The lower classes get group shots.  So having your senior picture taken is a big deal, because that is the way everyone will remember you forever.

      Also note that one is generally told, or indeed forced, to wear a tuxedo (if male) or a conservative looking dress (if female), so this whole experience not-so-subtly reinforces gender norms in the way that every American alive has internalized from way young.  It's like we're taught to think of ourselves as extras from Happy Days.

      In my conservative Midwestern city, there is always hell of drama seen on the 10:00 news about one local rebel who dyed his hair green and about how the envaliant school administrators would consequently not allow his senior photo in the yearbook, because it goes against 'traditional values,' and all the conservative old stodgers actually agree with that decision and praise their local newsfolk for putting the public kibosh on that rebellious practice.   While those of us who have any sense shake our heads and later move away.

      Here in  Southern California we don't have anything that memorable.  Everyone has portraits.  The only difference between seniors and everyone else was that our portraits were in color and we HAD to wear our hideous royal blue gown. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, in essence, the younger classes looked better.  They got to wear whatever they wanted.  And they were in black and white, which hides nasty high school skin.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's been almost 10 years.  I think I may need to move on.

      This is completely true, you take pictures of yourself in a graveyard, you either have no class or are planning on making jokes about how you took pictures of yourself in the graveyard, which in itself is a pretty stupid thing to do, so much effort to ridicule self. <br/> 
Also I have an A average in Art History, not exactly history but its the closest thing I can take in my college right now. <br/>
