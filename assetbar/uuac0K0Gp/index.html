      Hmmm... I actually think its more like garfield is a medium point in children's print media. Calvin and hobbes being a high point. When I was a kid I ate that shit up, like goosebumps. If you want to read garfield as an adult and expect to be satisfied (in whatever way you are looking for), I suggest heavy, heavy drug consumption. And if you are taking that many drugs, I suggest doing something other than reading garfield. Now if you are 5, there is something about an orange cat that eats lasagna and hates mondays that hits close to home...

      I'm pretty sure Family Circus takes the cake over Garfield. <br/>

Although, the premise of almost every Family Circus is, "Ha ha ha, kids are fucking dumb." Which is a point of intersection twixt my own opinions and those of Family Circus.

      Why does this exist? Do the same elderly that watch a television that happens to feature talking animals and chortle (I possess guilty grandparents) also read this strip? It is abysmal. The joke almost becomes of merit in that it makes one feel like a cartoonist due to the reader's ability to predict, or more typically, out-humour the joke every time.

      This scraped a 4 for me because of panel five.  <br/> 
It is, in general, a rather quick write-off of a staple strip for Phillipe: oddly innocuous, naive stories about "illicit" activities. There's nothing new here, and no jokes that jump out as a point of focus. <br/> 
Furthermore, what's wrong with utilizing the entire scale in relation to, perhaps,  <em>Achewood itself</em> ? Not every strip is a masterpiece. That's the expectation of a daily in any medium.

      Am I allowed to interpret the scale of 1-5 as only applying to this comic?  Then a rating of 1 would be just as acceptable as a rating of 5.  If you use more of the scale, you can divide up all the comics to reflect your opinion more accurately.  If you only use 4-5, you are basically saying 'this one is good' and 'this one is not as good'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A 3 does not mean BAD.  People who complain that a strip 'only rates 4.1' should eat a loaf of bread and go to sleep.

      THE PROFESSOR HAZARD SCALE OF ACHEWOOD RATINGS: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1 = Bad art, no emotion. Rarely used, mostly in the first twenty or thirty strips of the series. (Alternately, used on reposts despite their quality.) <br/> 
2 = Generally reserved for photographic strips (baby hiatus). Also used on a strip that promises something but never delivers (the nautical tale of Molly Sanders). <br/> 
3 = Average art, average emotion. Generally the "social commentary" ones get this. Also given to jokes that I feel are too highbrow, and just end up making me feel dumb. <br/> 
4 = (The art score doesn't really change much from this point, because this is a copy and paste comic) Good emotion. Appreciable drama or humor. Used if I understand a joke/moment is there, but do not physically react to it. Most comics are fours. <br/> 
5 = A comic is automatically fived if I laugh out loud while reading it or its alt text. Similarly, if it is a dramatic storyline, this score is given for particularly touching moments. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Today's comic garnered a five. It was looking like a four, but the last panel combined with the alt text got a laugh out of me.

      You interpreted  <em>The Story of Molly Sanders</em>  as a "promise," professorhazard? I'm pretty sure it was a joke which began an ended with that one strip. Just like there was never actually going to be a strip in which Ray dramatically lamented the loss of his DAAAAAAAANG NAAAAACHOS! It was just a funny contrast between the epic and the banal. Whatever. It just seems sad that you'd drag the rating of a beautiful piece of comic art down just 'cause you missed the boat. But hey, it's your rating to use.

      I can't account for everything, but I will go so far as to cite the time that Lie Bot predicted Teodor's death, which then came to pass on that date. Fulfilling that callback to an earlier strip set the standard for whether or not we should expect that kind of attention to detail in the future.

      Just wondering: did this get lamed because I said there "ain't much standards in Achewood?"  Maybe I should've been more clear; there really ain't much in the way of standards when it comes to  <em>fictional integrity in its continuity</em>  (I didn't specify originally, I apologize).  I can't believe you'd think that the instances where Onstad has "resolved" storylines should set a standard when numerous other plot resolutions have never occurred (or may wind up "unsatisfying," in a traditional sense).  He even jokes on himself for this problem in the Ray Goes To Hell arch. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We all realize that Onstad has an amazing attention to detail in general, but I think that if you expect it to consitently manifest itself in plotlines and character histories, then you might be disappointed more than you'd like to be.

      You understand that I am making fun of myself here, not my fine colleague Rowboat - if that is, indeed, for what you "conscripted lamers" are laming me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have a theory regarding the need to lame with abandon, and it has something to do with preadolescent exposure to tubgirl, goatse, and LOLCats. I must apply Science to proof my equations.

      I don't know - I see that as one of the interesting things about this place. I mean, it  <em>can</em>  be taken too far, but it really does speak to the overall literacy of the regulars, here, which is refreshing. There's something to be said for that, I think.

      The common man? Fuck him, this is Achewood, he is not why we're here. Or perhaps he is, in his absence. Anyway, the path of self-improvement possibly lies in the attitude that my lack of knowledge is my problem and not Onstad's. Nice to have kinds of barometers though.

      I believe Beef's face to be an accurate indicator of each rating. For the record, I don't think I've ever rated below a 3. <br/> 
1: Beef is sad. The comic left me feeling worse than before I read it. <br/> 
2: Beef is disappointed. The comic does not hold up to the Achewood standard. <br/> 
3: Beef is expressionless. The comic was unmoving. <br/> 
4: Beef is smirking. The comic was funny, but not great. <br/> 
5: Beef is laughing. The comic was exemplary, and reaches a level all other comics aspire for.

      Well, since people are doing this, I'll throw in my two cents with a different spin. <br/> 
 <br/> 
1 - Most guest strips and all reruns. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2 - Some of the early stuff and some of the picture "vacation" strips (unless the text was great, which it was, occasionally). <br/> 
 <br/> 
3 - A strip which had promise but somehow failed to deliver. <br/> 
 <br/> 
4 - The average rating. I'd say 70% of all strips are rated four by me. And by "average" I mean average by Achewood standards only, as even an "average" Achewood is far better than any other contemporary humor comic of which I am aware.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
5 - A strip which has stitched itself into the fabric of my consciousness. One which sleeps behind my eyes. One which I often remember at odd times and which I would like to have show up on my profile so as to be quickly tracked down. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's how I do it. I know you don't care.

      That said, I realize that most of Acheworld thinks of the rating system as "achewood versus print media" and I don't like to impose my views on them, so I generally only rate strips I think are deserving of a four or five, and leave Acheworld to its own devices on the rest.

      That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard (I mean, you know, besides a bunch of other idiotic things). The whole point of this rating system is to differentiate between how good the different strips are. Can you understand the concept of a low ceiling? Are you honestly saying that this strip right here is every bit as good as "Until You are So Nude" or "The Dick Molecule"? Those strips made me laugh harder than "What are you in for Nice Pete", which made me laugh harder than this one. I don't think I've rated any strip 1, and I think I've only pushed 2 for a couple of guest strips and ones where there was only character development and nothing else, but demanding that there be only two options makes you an undiscriminating jackass. Don't force it on everyone else. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Regarding this particular strip, I never found the Philippe-centered strips that funny, unless he is being lied to or something bad is happening to him. Yea it's cute, but it's not FUNNY. If I wanted this kind of crap, I'd go back to my old job and listen to the lady in the next cubicle gush about her kids. <br/>

      You misunderestimate fan death. Fan death is the belief (held almost solely in Korea) that leaving an electric fan on in a room for an extended period of time (like when you sleep) will suffocate you. Many fans sold there have timers that will turn off after a set amount of time. <br/>

      This is how I see it: Achewood, Calvin & Hobbes, Tintin, 3 Greatest Comics. I don't want to order them. Achewood for its use of language and character development and human truth, C&H for imagination and character especially in a restrictive format, Tintin for its art, plot, and Thompson and Thomson.  Negative points for the racism, though.

That may sound like an affliction, but maybe one of those personalities is a supermodel named Felicia, which probably enhances autofellatio when she's the dominant persona. <br/>

      I have a few "stories" that some adult wrote down for me when I was five.  They were mostly rip-offs of Rescue Rangers episodes.  But the narrative style is exactly how Phillippe writes and how little kids talk: all immediate past tense.  Also: "AH-GHEEB!"

This might be one of my all-time favorites.  There are so many great things.  His actions are so well conveyed.  I love Philippe hiding against the wall in panel one, his little sailor suit (!), how he actually gets  <em>worried</em>  in panel 6, his little "phew" mouth in panel 7, and perhaps most of all, I love how stern he looks when he is pouring the glass of water.

      God, I love roleplaying. My current game of choice is Mutants and Masterminds, since I'm also a sucker for superheroes. The problem is that I can't find anyone else in my area that actually knows that roleplaying exists outside of Japanese SNES games or Oblivion.

      While not an ideal solution, there are Programs like OpenRPG that let you play over the internet. Some even support plugins for specific roleplaying systems. Look in the right places and it shouldn't be too hard to gather an online gaming group together. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, Shadowrun is tasty. Just throwing that out there.

      You have balls... and when I read this, it sort of struck home. He's kind of annoying when he's just being cute, as opposed to being tormented by one of the other characters.  <br/> 
Yesterday I was coming out of the ice cream shop with my best friend, saying how the kids I have been nannying annoy the shit out of me because somehow the stupid creatures don't understand that ice cream on a hot day (which they whinged and whined to have and their dumb parents bought them) will MELT if they don't eat it quickly, and they always hold it really loosely and start by eating the bottom of the cone, and then it melts all over their clothes before falling on the floor. "It's like I want to scream, 'I know you're six years old, but are you fucking retarded?'" I told my friend. Then I realised I was surrounded by little kids all gaping at us. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kids stopped being adorable and cute a while back. I'm dry and bitter now. Give me Teodor, Roast Beef or Cornelius Bear. As I said, Phillippe can come to the party as long as it's for the amusement of an evil squirrel or something.

      I think there is a legitimate level of genius and artistic merit in the blog posts of Ray, Roast Beef, and  Chris. Similarly, there are arcs that are mindblowingly poignant and hilarious beyond, and i almost always stems from Onstad writing for the Ray, Beef, and Cornelius characters. I'm a big fan of this strip, but to me there's an enormous disconnect between the sophistication of the strips and arcs involving those characters, and the cutesy ones involving Phillippe, or the gross-out "dildo my coffee" Lyle bits. Naturally there are exceptions, but for the most part I know when I see Phillippe in a strip, the material isn't going to hit home for me. Granted, it wouldn't be Achewood without the full roster of characters, but if it were all Phillippe and Teodor all the time, I'd have no reason to ever read this comic.

So sensitive, in fact, that any negative feedback on an Achewood comic personally offends him(?) to the point of sifting through old posts to try to string together some sad little conspiracy. Certainly, it is much more likely that one person created two accounts in order to spread blasphemy, than it is that two different people might not think every strip deserves blind praise and champagne toasts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am not neonfreon, I'm shades. Chill with the Joseph McCarthy act. A perfunctory glance at my posting history has plenty of positive feedback mixed in the negative. The option to vote "1" is there for a reason.

You know, I understand what kind of person you're talking about. I really do. But if you'd done any homework you'd have seen that I do not live up to the description. At least not often enough to warrant an accusation. The majority of my posts (including this thread, obviously) have more to do with Assetbar, itself. See, you could have easily nailed me as "The Guy Who Only Ever Talks About Other Peoples' Comments." Or, "The Guy Who Gets Drunk And Picks Little Slapping Fights With Strangers And Feels Weird About It Later." You would've had me with those.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And, if you were insinuating otherwise, I am a one account man. If I were the type to switch around, I'd have done so a long time ago. I've said some embarrassing shit here, too (like this comment, for example).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, hey - I guess I had it coming. For what it's worth, I guess I believe that you're not who I thought you were. But I did at least succeed in getting you to submit something that would suggest that you're an adult, or at least a human being. And you used punctuation! <br/>

      The only thing I don't understand about xkcd is why the guy doesn't hire someone else to draw his comics for him. And to write them for him. And why it's called that. And why it exists.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Other than that, it's cool.

      Well, if you look at some of Randall Munroe's earlier stuff on xkcd (which a lot of the time are just sketches he's done in his notebook and such) that he's actually quite a good artist, which leads me to think that the stick figure thing is a deliberate artistic choice. Why he made said choice would be a question for Munroe himself, and I don't particularly care to speculate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As to the name, I believe he had the domain name long before he started posting comics on it. He chose xkcd because he wanted a "word" that couldn't be pronounced phonetically. It's not an acronym for anything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the other opinions, well, i guess that's just, like, your opinion man.

      Well, I'll have to take a look at the early stuff.  <br/>

I will say that if he can actually draw and the stick figures are just an "artistic choice," it's kind of insulting.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I'll think twice.
