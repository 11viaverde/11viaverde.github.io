      Looking at it just now for the first time in two years (probably closer to three), I was also a little dumbstruck for a second. I can't believe that even four people got that.

      Ray and Lyle could actually pull this off and not worry about jail time--if it were just them and the victim.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If Ray had a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation device hooked up to an electrode-propelling taser, with the proper aim, he could short-circuit the right parietal lobe and nearby primary motor cortex temporarily. With a wide enough radius, that could impart 'visual neglect' in the contralateral visual hemisphere, causing the person to completely ignore their left side.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So if Ray were standing to the left of this person, and could get the victim to take out their wallet, he could shoot the device, cause the brain to throw the wallet, have Lyle waiting on the left side to grab the wallet, and the both of them could jet without the person being able to even see them. Roast Beef could even rig the software.
