      I dunno, after I finished reading through the archive, I've realized that there's a few complex under-the-radar sort of relationships besides the obvious ones like Ray/Beef. The friendship between Beef and Todd is one of those. Whereas everyone else pretty much grudgingly tolerates Todd (except Lyle, for whom he's just a drinking partner), Beef has frequent phone conversations with him and actually refers to him as a friend. This is particularly strange when you consider that they're pretty much opposite in terms of personality - maybe Beef just sympathizes with him because of circumstances?

      Oh God. You should see the alternative ending that they actually filmed and focus-grouped for T2. It was unbearably god awful. Our main heroine nursing a child in the playground, old and happy. Kids playing,  <strong>no</strong>  bomb going off melting their faces. Really. Google that shit.

      The question is whether that ending or T3 (and whatever that crap is they're trying to do with a fourth film now) is worse. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While T2 kind of completely screwed up the chronology of the plot (if the humans had won and the machines sent one last Terminator through at the last minute then the humans sent one guy back and blew it up how in the hell do people keep going back?) it was completely awesome and I can give it some leeway, but everything since then has just totally ignored continuity of any sort and just has them constantly jumping around all the damn time. I just totally can't get into that new show even though it has Summer Tan in it.

      It was directed by McG and has received rather poor to middling reviews by and large. I strongly doubt I will see it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think we can point to Charlie's Angels 2 as proof that McG is clearly an ass man... this explains just about everything.

      Actually, I think Roger Corman used to film some movies in times as short as 3 days (this is just the filming).  I would not be surprised that someone, especially if they're stuck doing these kind of films, might totally forget them, if done in a similar time span. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Until my mom recently reminded me, I had forgotten that I skipped an entire week of school while my parents were out of the country, back in my high school years.  Now, granted, that was just not going to school for 5 days, and not making a feature film, but this guy could've been coked up or wasted or something through a lot of this film.
