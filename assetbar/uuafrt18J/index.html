      It seems a little harsh that both Hell's inhabitants and their victims wind up there. Perhaps those flowers are printed from their victim's pain, which when they forget, sinks through their shoes, into the ground and drips directly into Hell's Printing Press. <br/>

      something about our obsession with Beef's complicated structural choices has resulted in you saying "all hella haunted" and I like it. There's a line in the Beck song "Dark Star" (Off  <em>The Information,</em>  which was bad), "listen to the noise on the battery tape deck" and the sound of his consonants clicking into place do wonders for me every time, despite the presence of the hulking beast of depression that roamed that album's countryside... <br/>

      Jesus Hotcakes Christ I  <em>love</em>  vanilla vodka and orange soda. I used to drink it in my first studio apartment before I had glasses, so I would drink half of a can of generic orange soda and then fill the rest up with vodka. One night me and my so-gay-he-flies buddy got so fucked up on fifty-fifties he peed in the sink and started singing the national anthem in hopes I wouldn't hear him do so. But he forgot the words to the national anthem, so he just screamed "NATIONAL ANTHEM" over and over while he defiled my toothbrush.

 I mean tails just don't work like that, sure it makes him more humiliated to have his crack a showin' and he is a cat that walks in his back legs, but it just don't seem right, that it is not a real thong, feels so wrong, though it would would feel pretty wrong to see Ray ass just starin' me in the face, but I think that would feel less wrong.
