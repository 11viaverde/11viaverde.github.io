      7 meant delete on my voicemail system in the lower 48. Now that I live in Alaska our crappy, cobbled-together system has "3" for delete. It messed me up for the first few weeks I was here until I got used to it. Anyway, I think of this strip every time I have to delete a voicemail message. I like this strip.

      Interesting--why is it always odd numbers that mean "delete"? Might it be because they leave a remainder (the deleted message) when divided by two? Or have I just had too much of this whiskey called "Old Pythagorean" that I found in on the bottom shelves in one of the many sketchy grocery stores in my neighborhood? <br/>

      I think people think they can just put "old" in front of any dang word and it can be a whiskey. "Old Antideluvian". "Old Rutabaga". "Old Hematoma". <br/> 
Altho I would probably drink those. Maybe not the last one.

      Well, I like Jeff Beck. He's the least pretentious of all the old ex-Yardbirds lead guitarists (e.g. Clapton, Page). On the other hand, he did discover Rod Stewart. Feh.

      What about your friends <br/> 
What about <br/> 
What about your friends <br/> 
What about what about <br/> 
 <br/> 
Every now and then i get a little crazy <br/> 
That's not the way it's supposed to be <br/> 
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy <br/> 
I can't tell who i should trust or just who i let trust me (yeah) <br/> 
 <br/> 
People try to say i act a little funny <br/> 
But that's just a figure of speech to me <br/> 
They tell me i changed because i got money <br/> 
But if you were there before then you're still down with me <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chorus: <br/> 
What about your friends will they stand their ground <br/> 
Will they let you down again <br/> 
What about your friends are they gonna be low down <br/> 
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well is it me or can it be i'm a little too <br/> 
Friendly so to speak hypothetically <br/> 
Say i supply creativity to what others <br/> 
Must take as a form of self-hate <br/> 
Only to make an enemy <br/> 
Which results in unfortunate destiny <br/> 
They dog me out then be next to me <br/> 
Just cause i am what some choose to envy <br/> 
 <br/> 
Every now and then i get a little easy <br/> 
I let a lot of people depend on me <br/> 
I never though they would ever deceive me <br/> 
Don't you know when times got rough i was standing on my own <br/> 
I'll never let another get that close to me <br/> 
You see i've grown a lot smarter now <br/> 
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see <br/> 
If your friend is true they'll be there with you <br/> 
Through the thick and thin <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chorus <br/> 
 <br/> 
Friends... <br/> 
Let you down again.... <br/> 
Be low down... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well get giggly boogly <br/> 
I'm attack it like a seizure <br/> 
I got rhymes at my leisure <br/> 
Time when i need ta <br/> 
With t to the l to the c <br/> 
What i be sayin' <br/> 
Gettin' loose on this track <br/> 
With underground is where i'm stayin' <br/> 
So hip hip hooray organizers comin' in <br/> 
Own a friend like the oj <br/> 
But what about your friends to the end <br/> 
Will they run on out his eagle <br/> 
Or you'll find 'em stickin' close to your side <br/> 
Like a big bunch of fiends <br/> 
Six now the groupies drinkin' water <br/> 
I get real funny so you'd better hide your daughter <br/> 
Oh buddy oh pal oh chump friend of mine <br/> 
Say you're close like ketchup <br/> 
A virgin that's right you call me bruce lee right <br/> 
Bite the styles that we make <br/> 
And gives me enough respect for this funky remix <br/> 
One one thousand two one thousand three one thousand blitz <br/> 
Now the rabbit felt blue so i gave the nigga trix <br/> 
Cuz i was his friend wasn't down for the bickin' <br/> 
You called me a friend we're seven about to takin' <br/> 
Take a tickin' keep on lickin' why you dippin' we're the border <br/> 
You said you'd be down for richer for poorer but <br/> 
O-u-t-k-a-s-t ain't no change so tlc go head and sang baby <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yo is it me <br/> 
L to the e-f-t-e-y-e (a ha ha) <br/> 
Or can it be i am a little too <br/> 
Friendly so to speak hypothetically <br/> 
Say i supply creativity to what others <br/> 
Must take as a form of self-hate <br/> 
Only to make an enemy <br/> 
Which results in unfortunate destiny <br/> 
They dog me out then be next to me <br/> 
Just cause i am what some choose to envy <br/> 
 <br/> 
Brrrrr.....ba ba ba <br/> 
Back up <br/> 
This ya wicked remix <br/> 
Come down wicked sing <br/> 
Rewind with em aya <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chorus <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chorus <br/> 
 <br/> 
People say i act a little funny <br/> 
I wouldn't change not for no money <br/> 
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me (yeah, yeah) <br/> 
Even though i might seem easy <br/> 
It don't give you no cause to deceive me...
