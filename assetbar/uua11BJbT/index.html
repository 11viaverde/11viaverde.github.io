      This isn't as eclectic as it may mean to be, when you're vomiting repeatedly it always seems like its going to go on forever, you feel like an old man, and as you stare at the ground a little voice tells you that you aren't going to be ok.

      You're asking things to make sense in a comic about anthropomorphic animals living hidden in human society where they have a large underground city and occasionally travel to the afterlife and back. <br/>

Perhaps there is some deeper meaning here or perhaps it's just a story. Whichever it is, I find the fact that there's an old man that constantly vomits fairly amusing, so there's your basic humour. If Onstad  <strong>is</strong>  in fact trying to create some surrealist art here then I don't have a problem with it, or the fact that he's doing it in a webcomic. I don't see why you must expect artists working with this medium to keep it simple, especially when Onstad himself has gone to such great lengths to turn his webcomic into something original, gripping, and amusing and nothing short of a masterpiece in some places.

      i thought of this arc as a parody of surrealism, and enjoyed it a ridiculous amount. <br/> 
i loved Eraserhead, and i really liked that backwards-dancing midget from Twin Peaks. Onstad obviously appreciates this kind of thing as well and he was just paying homage to a subject that he has an interest in. <br/> 
Back off caduceo and let a dogg do his thing. it's not your comic strip.

      Yea, I'm gonna go with the parody angle too, which is the same thing I thought about the Cartilage Head arc. I agree with the general sentiment that webcomics should be funny, but to people who are familiar with surrealism and magical realism, seeing such references in a webcomic about cats is indeed funny. I had much more of a problem finding anything funny about The Great Outdoor Fight, which seemed to be just a not-quite-ironic homage/parody to bad 80's action movies of the same sort that South Park has done to the point of overkill.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do think it's a bit ridiculous to make some kind of grandiose artistic claims for this. At the risk of elitism, I'm just going to say that discussing this on the level of serious art is a stretch. I doubt we'll see Onstad's work in MOMA any time soon.

      Agree, and also the Cartilage Head strips. Look I know they were great but Cartilage Head just disturbs me on a level that nothing else can. (Keith Moon's head was mildly disturbing, but still funny because it seemed so harmless. The earth in this strip is...unsettling, but nothing I have read of Achewood so far has disturbed me as much as Cartilage Head.)
