      They're probably not cp, but you should keep in mind that cp doesn't have to involve nudity.  Also, pictures of nude children isn't necessarily CP.  It is a balancing act, and the best thing to do is not to go to sites about pedophile bears stalking half naked children.

      I didn't even say high schoolers, but rather high school graduates. A group that would include a large majority of us here. It's more about the system than than the students. If anything the good ones are even better for making it through relatively unscathed.

      Luke 22:54-62 (KJV) <br/> 
 <br/> 
54 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>So then the cops dragged him off to this priest's place, right? Peter hung back a bit though, but wanted to see what the deal was.</em>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Once everybody finally showed up they get it nice and toasty and dude just chillaxes.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>But then this ho fixed on him and was like "Hey, this is one of that dude's friends!"</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>"Hells no bitch, I don't know that dude"</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>After a bit some other guy comes through and said "You are totally one of those guys!", but Petey was all like, "Man, I ain't even."</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>'Bout an hour later and yet another douche comes by sayin', "He must have been with him, dude's Galilaean"</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>"What the fuck man?", and just as he was gettin' this out the rooster crows.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>And so Jesus just like looks at him and he's like "OH SHIT! Dude fuckin' called it."</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>So Pete he runs out the door and cries like a little bitch with a fuckin' skinned knee and shit.</em>

      I wonder when the Pope stopped boning. I mean, I know that celibacy was technically required of the priesthood from the 12th century onwards, but when did the Pope cease to be the main badass of Europe, with a massive army and an entourage of concubines, and become a little chap who tells people to feel guilty about wearing condoms. Sixtus IV didn't care about condoms. He was too busy declaring crusades, fighting wars, building the Sistine chapel and having sex with his cardinals.

      I'm just amazed no one has mentioned the motherflipping  <strong>pornocracy</strong>  yet.  Best Historical Era Ever.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I was a kid we had this fold-out ruler with historical facts on one side and periods of history on the other.  The whole thing was very religiously minded (I think "Islam" was a period of history along with "late antiquity" and "the middle ages"), and one of the little historical facts it listed was just "850-1050: Pornocracy."  That confused the dickens out of my little-kid self.  So mysterious!  No one knew what it meant!

      actually deliberate swerving to draw attention to yourself is taught in motorcycle safety courses.  It helps alert drivers to your presence and helps them to more accurately asse your speed since it gives you a larger footprint on the road, therefore making your apparent size larger.  People tend to estimate the speed of a vehicle inaccurately when the vehicle is smaller or bigger than what they are used to.  Since learning to use this technique for the motorcycle, I've sometimes found occasion to use it while driving a car.

      I don't think trolling Onstad would be cool.  In fact I posted the comments from the paid assetbar here just so people could get a sense, via the comments, of what Onstad had created, and therefore a sense of what they were missing.  I did this to encourage people to subscribe.  Or maybe I did this to troll in a taunting way?  Who knows.  I'll ask my shrink tomorrow.

      <em>No cop was ever born who isn%u2019t a sucker for a finely - executed hi - speed Controlled Drift all the way around one of those cloverleaf freeway interchanges.<br/>
<br/>
Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop. Your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side when he sees the big red light behind him . . . and then we will start apologizing, begging for mercy.<br/>
<br/>
This is wrong. It arouses contempt in the cop - heart. The thing to do - when you%u2019re running along about a hundred or so and you suddenly find a red - flashing CHP - tracker on your trail - what you want to do then is accelerate. Never pull over with the first siren - howl. Mash it down and make the bastard chase you at speeds up to 120 all the way to the next exit. He will follow. But he won%u2019t know what to make of your blinker - signal that says you%u2019re about to turn right.<br/>
<br/>
This is to let him know you%u2019re looking for a proper place to pull off and talk . .. keep signaling and hope for an off - ramp, one of those uphill side - loops with a sign saying %u201CMax Speed 25%u201D . . . and the trick, at this point, is to suddenly leave the freeway and take him into the chute at no less than a hundred miles an hour.<br/>
<br/>
He will lock his brakes about the same time you lock yours, but it will take him a moment to realize that he%u2019s about to make a 180 - degree turn at this speed . .. but you will be ready for it, braced for the Gs and the fast heel - toe work, and with any luck at all you will have come to a complete stop off the road at the top of the turn and be standing beside your automobile by the time he catches up.<br/>
<br/>
He will not be reasonable at first . . . but no matter. Let him calm down. He will want the first word. Let him have it. His brain will be in a turmoil: he may begin jabbering, or even pull his gun. Let him unwind; keep smiling. The idea is to show him that you were always in total control of yourself and your vehicle - while he lost control of everything.</em>

      Shelbydavis I will share this traffic court story with you. Last summer I got caught in a revenue-speedtrap doing what is called 'prevailing' on the Interstate- 74 in a 60-mph zone. I was pissed about this and thought about going before the judge with video-cam evidence of how folks zip along there much faster, etc. <br/> 
 But I didn't. I went before the judge and took the option to do online traffic school.(it still costs close to the same as the ticket. The judge commended my wisdom) whatever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The point is not that, it is this- in municipal court, there are all kinds of the ladies, usually of the younger variety (iow, your age, not mine) Oftentimes, they are scared to be there, and misery loves company. Just someone to chat with ( quietly because this judge threw a few folks out for yakking), you get the drift? <br/> 
 There's a young guy behind me; I and this tall, hot shiksa next to him hear the story of his short life as he's hitting on her, and she's flirting right back. <br/> 
 It's the anxiety flirt, but it still counts. Oh yeah. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 He's out of the Navy, assault trying to break up a fight, let off by the cop, runs into the same cop later in dubious situation, etc.etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
She gets called before the judge and I turn around and sign to him "did you get her phone #?" <br/> 
None of my business, but you know- she'd been chatting him up too. <br/> 
 He looked at me helpless, blank, because he didn't. For all his bravado with brawls and the jobs he'd had, he was too scared to, or didn't think to- whatever the reason. <br/> 
 And she waved and smiled at him as she walked out of the courtroom and his life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Municipal Court, shelbydavis- that's where you'll find some good girls in some bad scenarios. How you get there and what you do when you get there is your business. <br/>

      Serendipity is a strange bedfellow.  Smaller scenario: me and my friend decided to read for a class somewhere quiet on campus nearby our next class, so we chose the "student corner" by the foreign language dept.'s offices.  In walks Cute Girl #1 from that journalism class I dropped two days into the semester.  First time I've seen her since.  I drop my book and chat her up a bit, get her name, and as she leaves, I realize I didn't give or get any valid info ie: number, party invitation for my house that weekend, etc.  So be dang careful, is what I guess I'm saying.

      Being a loser is a state of mind.  You can complain all you want about the circumstances of your life, but complaints won't change anything.  You can attempt to change, but right now the economy and general status of the US is heavily against you.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Best thing to do is to, first and foremost, remember again and again all you have to be grateful for.  Not everyone has parents  to live with.  Then try to find something to do to GIVE!  You live with your parents, good, you don't have to worry about being homeless.  Now go volunteer somewhere.  Try to help somebody else.  You'd be amazed at the results that will eventually proceed.

 <br/> 
A) Go check your undercarriage and, if necessary, flag down the officer and see if he can assist you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
B) Stand nonchalantly behind the car as if you are removing something from the trunk in order to obscure the view. <br/>

C) Quickly go inside and ask your girlfriend to come out and rev the engine because you think you heard the car making that expensive noise again. <br/>

      One thing I have learned is that, whenever you move to a new state and have to take its driver's license test, you should first get the state's pre-test handbook and memorize anything in it that seems trivial.

      No, not really. That would mean it wasn't a "decade-plus". I'd say that Ray is most likely to be approximately Onstad's age as far as it ever matters. Thus, I'd say he's probably in his early 30s.

      so I took a few minutes to log into some of the accounts I have created over the past few weeks, and ignore assetbar_admin, in the hopes of forcing him onto the global ignore list.  well anyway, turns out I have created more accounts that I realized.  There were dozens!  Every page of the list of members had several!  so anyway, it didn't work.  I guess none of my accounts has any clout when it comes to the global ignore heuristics.  this video game sucks. <br/>

      i'll bet if you delete the cookie from assetbar and then log back in, it will all start working again.  one way to test this theory is to start a private browsing session, something that the newest versions of firefox and IE let you do.  when i na private browsing session, none of your existing cookies are used.  This will force a fresh cookie to download from assetbar when you log in.

      yes and no.  To some extent I have no life, and to some extent, I'm just vegging out and would be watching seinfeld if I wasn't trolling.  Are we not entitled to a little down time, a little putting the mind on hold?  Well truthfully, it is a pretty sad existence when you put your mind on hold every day for a few minutes or more...  why put your mind on hold at all?  why veg out at all?  Hey I'm not the only one, however...  While I choose to go against the grain and be a troll much of the time, many people who contribute positively don't really have much of a life either, or if they do, then assetbar is their 'mind on hold' time.  I think some people have to some extent formed meaningful relationships.  To wit, these two: <br/> 
[IMGS OFF]  I have no idea how long that lasted, but anyway, whatever, it proves the point that yes some people do find meaning here. But many people don't.  And even those that do, don't some or even much of the time.  But still.  For mindless downtime, you can't beat this place.  You never know what will turn up, what may inspire you, or cause you to laugh out loud.  Yeah the place has gone downhill since it's inception, but hey, whatever.  We'll all move on at some point and find something better.   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413121637/https://midconet.net/achewoodtest/killers-read_my_mind.mid">https://midconet.net/achewoodtest/killers-read_my_mind.mid</a> <br/>

      But do all the intricate things you do here really feel like "mindless downtime?" I really don't know what's entailed in all of those bizarre undertakings of yours, but it seems like a lot of work to me. And for what? Just to be hated by a hundred strangers? What does that do for you? I'm seriously curious. I've given you some thought (and if that means you've "won" or whatever, then so be it) and I want to know what's in it for you. You seem like a reasonably intelligent person. Surely fucking shit up isn't the only way for you to get noticed. I think it's pretty lazy, actually. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As to whether or not this place is a waste of life, of course it is to some extent. But a lot of good things are. I'd hate to imagine a life devoid of wasted time. I mean, I'd probably be richer and physically healthier and all that if I aggressively seized every waking moment of my time, but I'm sure I'd also be crazy and/or miserable, as well. Not worth it as far as I'm concerned. I have my worthwhile social and artistic activities and then I have things like this which fill in the blanks. It's very useful for that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not sure exactly what real  <em>meaning</em>  I can take away from this place. The only notable effects it's had on my life in the three or so years that I've been coming here regularly to semi-regularly is that I've been able to somewhat enjoyably pass the hours at a somewhat bland job (I rarely do this at home unless I'm drunk and/or high and there's literally  <em>nothing</em>  else fun to do) and that I get amusing facebook status updates from about fifteen people whom I don't actually know. And now that I think about it, I think it has helped me with my writing a little. Not that I've written anything great here or elsewhere, but it's like doing crossword puzzles when you're old in order to stave off senility. I flex the writing muscle and it doesn't die. That's good. Is this the best place in which to do it? I don't fucking know. I do know that I'm never going to write a great novel or anything, so I think it's as good a venue as any.

I disagree with that sentiment.  I think that one's brain can learn many different approaches to how it manages it's attention and focus.  At any given time, our current approach is only one of those which is possible.  Some different approaches might not be healthy, but I'm sure that some would be healthy and sustainable and balanced. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well that's cool that you've given me some thought.  Yes there is this school of thought that goes "don't feed the trolls"  The premise of this theory is that any attention (positive or negative) paid to the disruptive behavior of the troll reinforces the negative behavior of the troll.  This is classic behavior theory.  To some extent it's a valid premise and to some extent it does apply to me as it does apply to anyone, but, mostly, I am in my own world.  I seem to have Asperger Syndrome, and/or ADHD.  When it comes to forming social relationships and picking up on social cues, most people do this stuff more efficiently than I do.  I simply tend to be more interested in solving puzzles like how to hack assetbar or in interactions with people which are meta, recursive, or which rely on those aspects of interaction which aren't so much tied to having a social relationship with the particular person you're having the interaction with.  Practical jokes, humor, and pushing buttons fall in this category.  In interactions with friends over the phone and in person, I gravitate more towards asocial themes and humor, whereas I suppose the average person might expend more time than I do thinking about and maintaining and developing the social aspects of the relationship.  I'm on one end of a spectrum, and on the other end of the spectrum are people who are obsessed with their social standing, with what their friends think about them.  Personally, I have a lot of difficulty even recognizing new people, sometimes even if I've met them several times before. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Being hated by strangers for hacking assetbar validates my puzzle solving, so I enjoy that.  Being hated for my sense of humor is cool too, because again, it validates the work I put into my humor.  Some of my humor is lazy, but the more you get to know me, (which isn't that much possible on assetbar,) the more my humor adapts to you and sets you up to take you down, find what for you are your funny buttons and your absurd buttons... I am very patient and always calculating, so sooner or later I will be able to steer the conversation in a way that lets me do my thing, slip in a dead-pan, whatever...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But when people vehemently hate me, eh, that's kinda boring, maybe those are just boring people.  I am not someone who seeks to be a neutral hue that will not clash with anyone's personality or world view, so yeah, some people hate my sense of humor, some people are uncomfortable around me.  Oh well.  That doesn't bother me.  In real life, hanging out with people in person, most people get along with me fine, and some people love me, and only maybe 10% max hate me... don't get me wrong, a great many people think I'm very strange, but they still get along with me and find me kinda fascinating or quirky or endearing or some such.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But in this environment on assetbar, eh, I don't really form social connections with people, as I lack that sort of intuition...  I'll put it to you this way... if you compare assetbar to real life, the possibilities for self-expression and for understanding other people in written form on assetbar are far limited as compared to the full range or bandwidth of expression that is possible face-to-face... well.. maybe the full amount of expression and social communication that you, the normal person, are able to achieve on assetbar, is what I am able to achieve in person face-to-face... so where does that leave me on assetbar?  So I think because I don't connect with people socially on assetbar, they don't have any sort of context for my humor, and it seems just dumb and annoying and in various ways offensive to them.  Assetbar is a social environment.  Most regular posters on here have various social concepts of who the other posters are, and have various relationships with each other.  Personally, I think it's somewhat lacking in imagination how people will rely on their social contemporaries to tell them what they think about someone... and you see that to a significant degree on assetbar -- you see people form a consensus more for the sake of contributing to the formation of a consensus than for the sake of forming an opinion one way or the other...  It's like everyone on here are fucking snake in the grass Jews or something.  I sort of have a visceral intuition that tells me to resist such group-think, because that's how holocausts happen, and such.  So by doing my thing, I'm taking a stand for freedom, bitches!  You could never know what it's like Your blood like winter freezes just like ice And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use And did you think this fool could never win Well look at me, I'm coming back again I got a taste of love in a simple way And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid I'm still standing after all this time Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah Once I never could hope to win You starting down the road leaving me again The threats you made were meant to cut me down And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now <br/>

      the last comic was posted on 12.11.2009 and has 1,564 views.  Of course, you'd have to actually be supporting Onstad with a premium fan flow subscription to know that.  It's $3 a month.  highway robbery, I know.

      Holy tap dancing maggots!  The last comic is ONE WHOLE DAY NEWER than the last one?  And wowee gumballs, 1500 whole views, compared to the 200,000 on this specific strip?  Guess which one is getting more traffic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ditch the subscription bullshit.  Sell  teeshirts and update more than 4 times a month. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, fwiw, if I was paying three dollars a month, I STILL wouldn't be happy with the last update being 4 days ago.  So that would be robbery, highway or otherwise.

      by the way onstad has posted something on average every 2.6 days this month, and last month it was an average of something posted every 1.6 days.  And that's not counting anything that might have been posted in the blogs, that's just entries on assetbar.  So I mean, if you want more content more frequently, maybe you should shell out $3.

      I bought the first round of Achewood books, the white cover ones without any extras.  I have purchased several shirts, I've purchased the cookbook, I purchased the first round of 'zines way back when, I've purchased the pins, I bought the greeting cards.  I supported Onstad, I've given him plenty of my money (those old books were not fucking cheap).  Is it too much to ask that, now that he's raking in cash on this, he at least give us two strips per week which aren't long rambling text printouts (I'm looking at you, North Korean arc)?  Look back at even 2007, there were three, sometimes even more, strips per week.  Shorter, yes, but just as good.  I don't understand why I should be grateful that Onstad hasn't learned the lesson from the toilet at the airport.  If you're not really going to make more strips more often, DON'T PROMISE IT.  If you promise a strip on Monday and you know you won't make it, DON'T PROMISE A DEADLINE.

Onstad should give us more strips. <br/>

You're also saying that Onstad promised to give us more strips, but in actuality, he didn't.  He said he was going to try it.  Well...  maybe he tried it and it didn't work?   <br/>

      There was the promise of a blowjob in an airport bathroom. It did not end particularly well and a lesson was learned by all. Sadly, the damage was irreversible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Although Onstad has not shown a good ability to make his self-imposed deadlines or, at least, to estimate reliably, one would think that he would be aware that he is likely to be very busy around the holidays as he so often is and try not to commit to more strips, even if they are shorter.

You may use the above link to automatically read multiple strips, thereby allowing your new assetbar account to make as many comments as you like.  (New assetbar accounts aren't allowed to make multiple comments until they've "read" an ungodly number of strips.)

It's too bad that there are pieces of shit in this world who write software like manifests no respect for the efforts of other people. This means you, assetbar folks.

      The problem with your reasoning is that he devotes more time to the paying customers because that's gonna keep a roof over his head and put his kids through school! That's why the free strips are fewer and far between. Exactly the same thing happened with Frank Cho and Liberty Meadows, Once Marvel came a'knocking with the bucks to draw The Avengers and Spiderman, he stopped doing the newspaper strips.

      Pulling out before you're done seems like kind of a let down. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've never fully understood the appeal of facials for this reason. I mean, instead of finishing properly you'd rather weakly wank one out? I mean, I can see the technical reason in porn, but outside of that it seems like you're giving up more than you're getting in return. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps the better question is why it matters so much to you to not cum in your mouth? I mean, you're cool with everything else so why stop there? <br/>

In the end though do whatever makes you happy.

      Well, I've already talked about this fairly extensively somewhere else on the 'bar, so I won't go into great detail here. In brief, though I have been curious, I could never get myself to eat my own cum. Because I, myself, would not eat it, I would also not have anyone else do so unless it was specifically requested. In my experience, no one really wants that.

      I pull out before I'm done while I'm rawdoggin' it because I don't want a kid.  It's that simple.  Anything that cuts down the chances, homey. <br/>

You ain't gotta do a facial per se, you know.  Shoot it on the chest, pelvis, ass, whatever.  It doesn't have to be even as deregatory as it sounds.  Not all girls want you to bust a nut in them, you know.  Some girls are down with the spillage instead of morning-after pill-age. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wouldn't want to suck my own dick because C'MON it's kind of weird, man.  There are certain things that are better when someone else is doing it to you and not you to yourself.  Like a tracheotomy. <br/>

      I got a GoF shirt and that "can't you...see!" comic in color print but somethin about achewood seems to have lost me.  was there...tooo much character development?  I think I'd be totally down for a new character.  A new permanent fixture character.   <br/>

      feh i repent my achewood baulking ways.  party of my rage came from the fact that i finally went for that "subscriber only" content on the front page after holding off for 5 years and was sorely dissapointed.  that boner comic you saw for free was the best one.  onstad just trolled me so bad.  but the nate small book was amazing

      It's sad the the boner comic is no longer linked to on the front page (as far as I can tell).  I really needed to send that picture to somebody a few days ago, to emphasize the fact that rollerskatin' is all about diggin' boners.

      Nah, here's the deal: the subscriber content is not about a comic, but instead about his writing.  Really, for me, if he never made another strip, but just wrote  <br/> 
Achewood novels, that would be fine.  I laughed longer and harder at some of the written pieces in the sub. cont. than I ever did at even the funniest of the comics.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, if, instead of writing publishing and selling novels, he wants to parcel it out in the sub. cont., cool by me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As long as there is no Achewood Christmas specials on NBC, :eek: it's all good!
