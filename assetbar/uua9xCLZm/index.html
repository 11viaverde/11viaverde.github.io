      Oh, oh god. THIS SORT OF HAPPENED. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So me and my friend were in a really bad charity shop near us. It was in fact so bad that it was closing down and so all the stuff was like 10p so we thought it would be awesome but it was sort of depressing or would have been if it wasn't so damn funny. She was just looking at an Eric Cantona annual from 1991 or something, and in this little cabinet thing in the corner, I clocked a small  <strong>ceramic figurine</strong>  of a teddy bear looking kinda sad and holding up a sign that simply said 'Sorry'. And there were two of them. I was trying to tell Luce and just laughing so much I had little hope of speaking and just waving my hands toward the cabinet to draw her attention to them and then when she saw them and her face I had to actually just leave and stand outside laughing because I felt terrible for the people who owned the shop. And because I was getting really worried that I wouldn't be able to stop laughing until I had urinated in my trousis or something. It was a wonderful, terrible thing.
