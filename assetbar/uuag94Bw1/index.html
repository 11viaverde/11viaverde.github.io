      why would you post with only the word "first"? if you're excited about being the first poster (only God knows why) espouse an interesting and astute observation bout the comic strip. and then if you must, hit return a few time and type "Woot first post, I RULZ assbar" or something along those lines. but including the thought proving and insightful words at th beginning, and maybe celebrating the thrill of firstposting in s quiet manner that stays in the realm of the audible, would save your actual thoughts from being tainted by Woo000ooOOttttttttttS!!!!!!111 and such. just a thought that i had

      You have to understand, this is in a time when pictures were not a common medium. To have your picture taken with the president was a big deal, big enough to worry about the details- well, should he be touching the president or not? Surely no common man should be shaking hands with President Lincoln in a photograph."  It would have been as over-analyzed as any celebrity paparazzi shots are now.  Better to make it inoffensive and stoic than incite a riot.  Plus, the man was trying to unite a nation divided.  He couldn't be too friendly in photographs with Yankees, as not to inspire Rebel blood to boil. <br/>

      Well, to be precise, it was not  <em>originally</em>  so. I think the derivation of the term comes from Los Angeles "L.A." being turned into "Hell A." (Hella) under the presmise that everything is special in some hell-like fashion in Los Angeles. Therefore if something was "Hella tall" it would be very tall like things in this Hell-aspect of Los Angeles. <br/>

Frankly I think that's an incredibly stupid origin but phrases can't choose their parents.

      Dang, we should definitely get the Missouri Chapter set up, though I have a feeling that there'll only be a few of us and it'll probably annoy/bore the piss out of the others here. Anyway, Missouri Acheworlders, sound off. I'm in STL, but I stop through sometimes. Maybe we can summit at Shake's at some point.

I say we force everyone moving by land from east to west of the Mississippi to travel through the arch. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm thinking we should force westbound air travel through it, too, because otherwise upstart dirigible ferry businesses would exploit this loophole.

      It seems assetbar doesn't like the " " or "plus sign," or maybe I just totally fucked up.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also blame my bad insurance rate on assetbar, along with the curious odor my socks have recently begun emitting. It is also why puppies cry sometimes, for no reason. They just know assetbar is out there.

      Let me tell you a story, maids and fellows. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once when I saw a little orphan girl sitting on a stoop in the poorest neighbourhood in a heartless town.  She had just spent her last penny on an ice cream cone, and spent the whole day prior to this begging at the local churches and charity organisations to get what she imagined a nice dress with which to justifiably enjoy this frozen treat.  A simple dress of red and white - but to her, an elegant gown not unfamiliar to ballrooms of Nice and Milan.  She had washed her face at the public toilets, cleaned her fingernails, and gone to the ice cream shoppe to purchase her rare treat in a childhood sorely lacking in child-like freedom. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There she was sitting, watching the vanilla drips sliding down the cone towards her fresh hand, utterly epitomising innocent and gleeful anticipation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When suddenly!  Out from the depths of Tartarus and through the darkest of alleys and byways came two unruly and untrusting rogues!  Pay careful attention, dear reader, for their form shall not be discussed - no, only the depths of their horrible depravity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I tremble as I tell you, dear reader, of what happened next. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The first of the cretins marched up to the still, at this point, innocent little girl and - behold! - swiped the ice cream cone from her hand!  With the poor urchin not yet crying from shock, the second rogue mercilessly began tossing AOL boot disks into her face until she fell over backwards.  And then - I hesitate from pain, dear reader - the first of these rogues... <em>gluttonously ate the ice cream cone in front of her.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am here to tell you, readers one and all, that the first of these horrible men, the one who stole and gorged on a poor orphan girl's first ice cream, was none other than Assetbar. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the second villain, the one who abused her just long enough for the fulfilment of her torment to arrive,  <em>was also Assetbar.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I say this as a warning, dear readers.  Be wary.

      Man once said he'd drive to natucket. see his familly, ask his great aunt what the harvest had been like, see whether his nephew still strummed a guitar on the porch idly counting the sunsets. Maybe even catch a glimpse of the old man who hobbled to the general store to buy a single peice of jerky before fearfully turning back when the purple clouds glared malevolently down at him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After a long and monotonous journey the man got to his relatives village, nobody there, wind rattling the shutters and the breakfast set on the table, long grown cold. as he crouched on the porch; despondent and broken he thought heard a reedy voice whisper in is ear. <br/>

On the bright side, it seems that Onstad definitely checks Achewood, as he used two pictures that were posted on yesterday's comic.  Makes it seem like we actually have more to do with this thing than just chattering about it at the periphery.

      On second glance, there is a picture in there that was not posted, and I remember from one of Onstad's blogs that he got a book on the Laying of the Transatlantic Cable, so he might have just scanned it from there. <br/>

I told a small group of friends about Gummo and they went and got fucked up and watched it. So I think they are worse off than I am. The world needs to understand that this is not a good idea.

      I don't think you understand what kind of a man Ash is. He doesn't kill people for fun unless they're trying to kill him, or more specifically,  <em>if they are the living dead.</em> <br/>

With his chin and his chainsaw for a hand, he protects mankind, getting mad rutty with any beautiful women lucky enough to be near him in between slicing up soul-eating freaks. <br/>

Chuck Norris jokes would cease to exist if it became common knowledge that Bruce Campbell hands even Chuck Norris his ass on a daily basis. <br/>

      I think most people passed liberal arts classes by making sure every essay peripherally mentioned animal waste or rot. Like, if you were writing about William Morris's Red House and his love of old sagas, you could say, "William Morris expressed great fondness for his perceived root of English identity in ancient Germanic tribes. He loved Scandinavian and Germanic stories about as much as I love the rotting carcass of a raccoon who has recently been annihilated by a Chevy pickup so that its intestines hang out of its sides like bunches of foul grapes, which is to say he loved it a whole, whole lot. Also, buckets of vomit and horror." <br/>

Her mom tells her day and night not to change with the crowd -- but that won't ward Wonder from wandering. She meets two boys, Jake and Mason, and is torn between them.

      Oh, cool. Did you also brush your teeth today? Mayhaps next you'll regale us with an entrancing tale about the challenges and travails you faced whilst eating breakfast! Seriously, that is a thing we don't care about. At least tell us why, or give us a humorous anecdote on how the "2" Roast Beef looked so sad. Come on.

You mean this one? Yeah, I've been going through a lot of avatars now, since most of people's replies to my comments have been "Is that John Wayne Gacy in your avatar?", "Acid Bath ROCKS, dude!" and even, once, "Burn in hell rapist clown".  <br/> 
It was time for a change, seeing as I no longer endorse raping little boys to death and burying them beneath my porch. <br/> 
And I think we have the same nightmares. I am also hell of afraid of clowns, dolls, mimes and suchlike.

      Hmmmh, are these pictures the same that were posted on assetbar on the previous strip? <br/> 
 <br/> 
COMPLETELY unrelated: I just started going out with the most wonderful girl I've ever met. She's beautiful, smart and funny, and most importantly for a shallow fuck like me: we share and complement each other's taste in music, movies, comics and other literature. <br/> 
But she doesn't like Achewood. It's not that she DISlikes it, either; she just does not 'get' it. I'm sure some of you have been in similar situations; how did you win these people over and make them realize that Achewood is sheer brilliance? <br/> 
 <br/> 
(yeah, that introductory question is just there as an excuse to post something completely unrelated to the strip)

      have you shown here "killing is like basketball?" You gotta remember when introducing someone to Achewood that the top rated strips are top rated by people who know the characters and contexts, and would not necessarily be the favorite of people who haven't read the archives.  Try "killing is like basketball," "the break-dance move Lie Bot taught Philippe," and (if you can convince her to read them) either the GOF arc or the Lonis Edison arc.

      Also, one time my girlfriend of a while back wanted me to read her a story because she was sick and wanted to sleep. She wanted me to read her a children's book to which she had sentimental attachment. I forget which one, I think it might have been  <em>Goodnight Moon</em> . <br/> 
Anyway, my point is, I did it but it felt really weird and awkward to me.

      This is what I did to convince my boyfriend to like Achewood. You have to link her to the first strip of the Great Outdoor Fight and let her read it on her own. You cannot be looking over her shoulder. You cannot even be in the same room.  <br/>

Then you have to make your avatar not be a John Wayne Gacy painting.

That got the ball rolling.  <br/>

      True. But for the sake of argument, say you had a birthmark shaped like a disfigured Mickey Mouse head in some concealed and shameful--but erotic--place. Her non-reaction to such a visage could be the difference between years of therapy and a simple t-shirt at the beach. There is no such thing as a glass half-full.

      I've said this before, but it seems like comments on the new strips seem to show up on page four. Well, they did until today, when page four filled up and rather than knocking comments off of page four, they started on the top of page five. (Which does, of course, knock comments that were on five on to six and so on...)  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Other than that they are grouped by the strip they are on, but how those are arranged seems indeterminable.

 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em><strong>Volume VIII - Emergency Party At My Place</strong><br/>
This is a pre-order and begins shipping the week of March 16th. <br/>
<br/>
Volume VIII spans from December 23, 2005 to September 19, 2006. Includes all the standalone strips, plus these story arcs: Philippe and the Couch, Magic Underpants, Badass Games, Pat's Dad, Leo Fontanetti, and Magreaux Dog. Also includes a selection of new, print-only material. Approximately 144 pages. Does not contain the Great Outdoor Fight arc, which will be published separately by Dark Horse Comics in September 2008. <br/>
<br/>
Production note: during this period the strips in our story arcs often ran to three, four, even six rows per day. In this volume, the longer story arcs are stitched together as proper self-contained stories, with titles and fins, and skipping the mastheads on individual strips. I find they work pleasingly well this way, and offer a new perspective on the material.</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
My feelings on this are pro.

      Is anybody else a little bit disappointed that Chris told SA about this more than a month ago but we, Acheworld, didn't find out about it until today?  I am a little bit.  I mean, I know it would be awkward for Onstad to actively participate in the forums for his own comics, because it's impossible to contradict his interpretation of his own comics, but still one would think that we would be his go-to internet dudes :(

instead a picture of a man armed with puppies stole his glance and after the quick connection of what the picture and the words above it meant, an evil grin crossed his lips and an entirely-too-loud bellowing of evil laughter SPRANG from his vocal cords and raced around his dwelling like banshees which disappeared as soon as they'd come. <br/>
