      The graphic below those words is going to be fucking insane. The Choose Your Own Adventure books always had covers like the publisher loitered outside an art school, picked up the rejects as they stumbled out, then took them home, dosed them with crack, and made them paint while tripping balls. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, two six year old kids riding a puma over a rainbow, chasing a solid gold robot with bottlecap eyes, as some mafioso below them drives through the Everglades as he fires at the viewer from a thompson submachinegun.  <br/>

      I didn't look at it much, but on the world map they display there are graphics over several parts of the earth. New Zealand has one labeled "Forecast from Stonehenge."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know if they think Stonehenge is near New Zealand rather then the near exact opposite side of the Earth, or it's ironic, or the forecast is being received by someone in New Zealand, but it makes me sad anyway.

drskradley, you probably gave up on the tattoo idea long ago, but in case you just haven't quite got round to it yet, it should technically be 'dis aliter visum' (not 'diis'). 'Choose your own adventure' is basically impossible to translate into Latin, it would come out as something like 'Pick a disaster for yourself!', which doesn't have quite the same ring...

      Possibly.  But I have two points to make: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. You might be expecting a little too much from porn production companies.  But then again, it's normally the porn industry that has instigated and adopted the latest trends of home video technology.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. I think what Chris is trying to note is that Connie did work for the Spice Channel, not whoever made the porn; the captioning that he did might not be what winds up on the actual DVD release. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm getting paid right now to do something else,  <em>but I'm doing this instead</em> .

      Some may have noticed it, but apparently no one said it: <br/>

 <em>The rollerskate strikes again!</em> <br/>

molesticide mentions in his (what is 'bottom'?) comment "the state of the coffee table." Other than that I can find no direct mentioning of the rollerskate and I am appalled. It is, of course, the harbinger of achewood death (or in this case, near death experience).
