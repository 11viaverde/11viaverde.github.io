      Nice call! Every other reading, I took it to be a general phrase for busting a deuce, but "packing Hot Lunches" is clearly a specific term for taking a shit in a brand-name ziploc sandwich bag.  <br/>

      I was a counselor at a Boy Scout camp for a few summers. I was a lifeguard at the pool. At one point, it was left up to me and another guy (both of us younger than the rest of lifeguards) to take the evening shift at the pool by ourselves for the first time. Then we are informed by a panicked youngster that some kid in changing area has passed out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Turns out this kid broke the three cardinal rules of scout camp so he wasn't having a pretty good day: <br/> 
1. He was dehydrated because he'd been drinking just a little soda instead of water for a few days now. <br/> 
2. He was walking the trails without a buddy (apparently he had told them he would "catch up" and passed out on the trail once already). <br/> 
3. (and most importantly) He hadn't shat for nearly a week and a half. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We called in the emergency, and got him onto a stretcher that was actually meant to rescue drowning victims who might also have back injuries. Then, in a truly epic moment of "aw fuck" we realize the position and proximity of the gate to a nearby wall prevents us from getting this kid out on this stretcher. We passed him over the chain link fence so they could drive him to the nearest hospital which was at least an hour's drive away.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't think he needed surgery though.

      I'm pretty sure getting "a little puzzled" doesn't go all the way to full-on drunk.  It's the rest stop on the way over from buzzed.

      I did that but it was for only a week and it wasn't at Boy Scout Camp, it was a school camp and I didn't need surgery so I guess it's nothing like this, I guess I just held in my shit for like 5 days yeah about 5 days but then I finally went because we had been climbing mountains and stuff all week and I couldn't handle that anymore also we were going to play this massive game of basically tag and I couldn't be expected to run in the snow with an ass full of sass also I was like 11 so there was no excuse for not shitting in a timely and consistent matter it's just the bathrooms were dirty.
