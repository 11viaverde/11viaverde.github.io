      I've often heard them called "avatars."  Maybe avatars are different, I don't know.  I have to admit, I don't really care...as I said above. <br/> 
 <br/> 
His is the cover of a Jim O'Rourke album.  It's a good album with a good album cover.  I've seen someone else with the cover to his "Halfway to a Threeway" EP cover, as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I believe I made my original comment when I had a shitty over-pixelated home made picture.  I haven't upgraded much: mine is currently just the cover to the Criterion edition of  <em>Days of Heaven</em> .  It's a good film. <br/>

      To answer the alt text ("What's with people who always seem to need to sprint in there when you're done?"), this person probably ate/drank at the same time as you (ie, you share meals), and also has a similar speed of digestion or bladder size as you. I think you can do the rest of the math yourself. <br/> 
Additionally, it could just be a typical reasoning fallacy, wherein the pattern-making animal, through non-rigorous data collection, distinguishes the existence of a non-random trend in what is statistically noise.
