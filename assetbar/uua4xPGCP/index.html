      The guy who looks like the lead singer of 100 bands that he hates is not judging. Personally, I think Onstad is a pretty handsome dude with some cool shoes. Though I might also be projecting my opinions on his extreme talent to come to that conclusion.

      I dunno; Beef's hair seems a little more sticking up/gel'd, while Onstad's hair seems more slicked back (at least, that's how I've always seen them both, I could defintely be wrong considering the lack of clarity in both strip and picture).  Also, looks like Beef's got normal glasses on, while Onstad's wearing shades. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, I think we all know the kind of person that Ray is trying to make Beef into.  We've seen them in cafes.  We've seen them at the back of the club during the indie rock or alt-country show, probably with their disinterested wife of 2 years but who is trying to show some enthusiasm.  We've saw them order mojitos with feigned reluctance a few years back.  We saw Jason Bateman play one in Juno.  We might work with them.  We might be them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I look at that picture of Onstad, and I don't see that guy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Except for maybe the shoes.

 <br/> 
I didn't think South America had like a crazy amount of AIDS. Am I wrong?

      I assume they have a terrible amount of AIDS. Not as bad as Africa, which just really went to town on the whole worst-possible-shit-you-can-do-to-promote-the-spread-of-AIDS, but still worse than, y'know, regular continents. <br/>

There's probably just as much AIDS at the Martin Luther King drive closest to you, than at the worst part of any southamerican city (ok Brazil does have a lot of AIDS, their women are too damn hot and they love to fuck). And you really shouldn't make assumptions based on shitty movies. <br/>

      I thought he looked like Jeff Goldblum at first.  and that is NOT a good thing. Bbut then in the last pannel I noticed the extra pocket in front, and Jeff Goldblum would never wear pants like that.  I guess what I'm saying is, I'm basically glad that Roast Beef didn't get tricked into looking like Jeff Goldblum.
