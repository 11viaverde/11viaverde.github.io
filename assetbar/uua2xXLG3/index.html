      When you put hot things in the fridge, you raise the temp of the whole fridge inside.  Then the motor has to work harder to lower the temp below the bacterial danger zone again and in the meantime all of your food is being stored too warm.  Beef knows you must get the food to room temp and then put it in the fridge because he knows Science.

      You SHOULD freeze food ASAP. If you don't cool it first, it means germs will have less time to multiply. As long as the food is properly sealed, the rest of the food isn't endangered very much. Of course, some think quick refrigeration ruins the flavor food, of course. <br/> 
At best, he's chosen money or flavor over safety, which doesn't sound like Beef.

      Sometimes it wrecks the texture, though. For instance, you never, ever want to refrigerate rice before it's cooled to room temperature- it'll turn out all crunchy and stale and nasty.

      twohundredninety has the way of it. <br/> 
But you should also understand that in the average home, right after air conditioning (and heating for an ill-insulated house in a cold climate), most of your yearly electricity bill comes from your fridge. <br/> 
This is why a full fridge is more efficient than an empty one (less air to flow out when you open it, energy concerns actually recommend putting gallon jugs of water in there if you can't fill it with anything else), and why you should try to have the door open as little as possible. <br/> 
Of course, aside from raising your electricity bill and possibly raunchifying your milk, your Stellas will  <em>certainly</em>  be less crispy.

      As long as you put the food in smallish and properly containers, the odds of milk getting ruined is pretty small. It IS fairly expensive, though, but the alternative is risking a ton of germs in your macaroni, and isn't Beef generally paranoid about stuff like that?

      I used to know a cook named Mark Fathery. This man spent his days cooking delicious greasy food for a bunch of college men, and dispensing wit and wisdom along the way. The stories he would tell were legendary for their special blend of earnest life-lessons and occasional complete disconnection from reality. My favorite times were when he would tell us his ideas about science. I went to a school dominated by engineers and other hard-science types, but Mark still taught us a thing or two. Mark taught us about the "thermocline." <br/> 
 <br/> 
You see, someone was about to put hot food in the fridge for later. Mark stopped him, saying it was a bad idea, as we see here. When asked why he shared his science fact of the day: When you put hot food in the fridge it creates a  <em>thermocline</em> , which is a layer of hot air packed close to the food by the cold air around it. The trouble here is not that the hot food heats up the fridge, it's that the thermocline can be so intense that it actually  <em>continues to cook the food</em> . Your food will be ruined, overcooked by putting it in the refrigerator.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The story spread. Throughout the day other people asked Mark about the thermocline and he happily (if confusedly) re-told his scientific insight. The concept of explaining  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100411093822/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer">heat transfer</a>  to a man thirty years our senior was so baffling that I'm not sure anyone even tried. We just went right on trusting him to prepare our food. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He also famously told us "salmonella is bullshit, man" while handling raw chicken. That man was a walking science book.

      Your friend Mark was partially right.  Hot food will continue to cook itself.  Usually when you cook something, you heat it far beyond the temperature you would consume it at.  All this extra heat has difficulty transfering itself away from the food simply because air is a very poor conductor of heat.  this is the same reason you wear a puffy jacket in the winter to stay warm.  Your body heats the bubble of air you've trapped around yourself and it stays there because air will be damned if it gonna transfer the heat someplace else. <br/> 
 <br/> 
however, if you fan the heated air away from the food, it will help to cool it faster but, but this is not conduction of heat. it is convection. Mark would do well to put the hot food in the walk-in near the big fan if he wants to cool the food quickly. <br/>
