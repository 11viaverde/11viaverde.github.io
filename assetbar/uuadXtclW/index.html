      I think the Stephen Fry avatar is particularly appropriate since he recently admitted to having manic depressive disorder. <br/>

Or rather, I recently watched a documentary about it which could have been made years ago. Who knows.

I would love to have had a quiz on this map in high school. Part of me wants to become a teacher just so I can make this happen.

      That's cool and all, and rest assured I wasn't the one who lamed you, but writers rarely make fun of cities in direct proportion to their dislike for them. If that was the case here, Onstad's most despised city would be Austin, and his second-most despised city would be Clovis, NM, which seems unlikely. Not that I know what he was up to, but many writers make fun of the cities about which they have mixed feelings, not which they stone-cold despise. <br/>

      I was being hyperbolic, and the Yankee-Perry business was purely a joke, in case that was unclear. I assumed that Texans would have some idea what I was talking about, and your question was poking fun at how overwrought I am. Please feel free to consider me overwrought when I've explained myself, as I intend to get bored before you do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
First, Austin is a technological hub, which is fair enough, though that's not as big a slice of the economy as it used to be. It also has Texas' big State University (I know you know these things, public forum and whatnot). Because of that University and (to a much greater degree) the fact that it houses the massive and wealthy state government, it attracts all sorts of investors, but especially real estate investors who wish to work in the state of Texas, with its leasing laws so famously biased towards landowners. These real estate investors will live in Austin, and buy land in rural, especially west, Texas. We then have money flowing "up" from impoverished west Texas to further stimulate the solid Austin economy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for Louisiana, I refer to the oil investors of Austin, and the partitioning of the oil resources of the Gulf of Mexico unfairly in Texas' favor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Both those things are also true of Houston, with one huge difference being that Austin is actually a pleasant place to live, and Houston isn't even a pleasant place to smell from a distance. And the University of Texas at Austin does stimulate the economy statewide, as well as make a legitimate contribution to world knowledge. Parents throughout Texas send their bright and ambitious kids to Austin, where they pay 50% more for a Newcastle than they would in Albuquerque, money that comes at least in part from their parents, elsewhere in Texas. That's a small scam, and those parents know full well they're coming out ahead with UT. But again, it's money flowing "up."

      I like to think that this strip wasn't written by someone with very little knowledge about Austin or Texas in general implying that Austin is the child-drowning capital of the US, but instead someone with a great amount of knowledge rightfully placing Waco as the capital. Also I don't know if Onstad had been to Austin at the time of this strips writing, but I can verify that he was here as recently as late 2009. Also also, this is my favorite strip because we get to talk about Austin! <br/>

      Both of those strips were way back in Achewood's early days, before most of the characters had been strictly defined and given a set role in the strip. As such, you can't compare them to strips today. <br/> 
 <br/> 
People are probably going to disagree, but I have to wonder whether Beef's character has really changed that much. He's found true love, moved out of his grandma's house, participated in the GOF, and yet he's still the same nervous wreck he's been before all of that happened. It's not character development if the changes aren't permanent.

      I don't see any deviation from his character development so far here. The dude is from Circumstances. In addition to his depression, which ranges from remissive to crippling (very true to form, I think), he has pretty massive anxiety issues. These compulsive ruminations on the horrors of the world don't seem like parody to me. In fact, they're almost too accurate to be funny.  <br/>
