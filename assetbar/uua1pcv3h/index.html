      Why is that lame? That isn't a particularly obscure or RPG-specific fact (although it was a good catch). Six-sided dice are everywhere, from the craps table to the Monopoly box. In fact, if you own a single instance of Yahtzee, you have five!

      Upon raiding an instance of Yahtzee,  solo, I found an anomolous region within the darkest confine of the instance, from which many multilimbed bipeds appeared to spawn in flashes of light. I call them the 'crapheads who enjoy Yahtzee', however the scientific name, eludes me.

By referencing first Zork and now D&D, Onstad is practically goading these people into abandoning their carefully constructed "cool guy" zones. You must understand; they cannot help themselves. They're not posting these sorts of Heavy Geek comments because they want to any more than a pack of wolves will devour a human infant because they specifically  <em>want</em>  to. It is a  <em>need</em> . It is in their DNA and it defines their souls.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad knows this. He lives in the wild and is leaving a human infant on his doorstep knowing full well what the wolves will (and must) react to. This is  <em>his</em>  sickness, not the wolves'. Shall we punish the wolves for acting on intractable impetuses which they could not possible understand, much less control? <br/> 
 <br/> 
No, friends.  <br/>

RPGers all letting out a strangled howl in anticipation (or is it disgust?). Onstad smirks into the night, turns and closes the door to the sound of paws scrabbling and slapping the dust, closing in on their fate.

      To the deplorable Mr. Chick: <br/>

My original letter simply inquired whether or not you were dead yet. In light of your negative reply and emphatic statement that you are still living, I have decided that I shall never again hire discount ninjas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your baseless vendetta against and continual bullshitting about a perfectly acceptable hobby irks me. If you believe that telling a story and rolling dice will summon up evil spirits from hell to devour your soul and/or make you commit suicide in a sewer, then you are the offspring of a mentally retarded chipmunk and a Twinkie. <br/>

On the one hand, I believe that all are entitled to their opinions and they should not be denied the right to express them, but on the other I wish that there was some way I could silence your false moral outrage and your misplaced, uninformed, fact-bereft, logic-starved, shit-lobbing monkey-screech blathering. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sincerely hoping that you contract leprosy, <br/>

      I'm gonna admit that I used to play, and we had one guy who was resolutely shirtless and beefy.  And he wore those little nuthugger running shorts most of the time.  I cannot tell you why, but it gave me great focus on the marker-board and my character sheet and anything but dudefella's groinal regions.

The answer is that ther is no such group. For if they ever existed, they killed themselves.

      My brother-in-law's D&D group -- which I avoid like Ebola, and for much the same reason -- plays together one night a month, down from 4 days a week in 1983. It's the same five guys. Nobody had to leave the state. Nobody had the INITIATIVE to leave the state. There is a sad, but scary co-dependency going on between these five Men Touching 40. (BTW, only four of them are dangerously obese; the fifth guy is just overweight.) They have wives, ex-wives, girlfriends and children, so they are not "alone", and their employment ranges from the raw exploitation of underpaid labor that is a schoolteacher's lot to the exiting and rewarding role of Assistant Manager in a the fascinating world of Strip Mall Retail. The fantasy lives that once enriched their carefree teen days now provide a refuge from the the drudgery, mediocrity, irritation, humiliation and futility of The Lower Middle Class Drone With A State University Degree. Mortgages, Minivans, Menopause and Balooning Prostates recede before the awesomness of watching Steve pull the dumbshit move he copied on a trip to Indiana in 1986, which he now "surprises" the others    with for the 1,127th time. And don't forget the warm touch of the 20-year-old dice, and the thrill of arguing yet again over what the results of the roll were (because, of course, the white paint wore off a decade ago).  <br/> 
Actually, these guys kind of like me because before I met my wife, she and her kids usually had to move every year, and my B-i-L used to round up the guys and make them do the work. Thanks, guys. Now go fondle your wands and leave me with bourbon.

      Haha, I guess. I think I didn't like Magic because it seemed way too exposed. There was always a lunch table of those kids in junior high who would gather around and play it, much to the confusion of everyone around you, and while I was always somewhat curious I always got the impression that it was supremely Taboo. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, Warhammer had long, detailed stories and histories written with a lot of gory artwork, which was pretty cool for a twelve-year-old, and what was more you could be dorky in the privacy of your own home without having a lot of people with more expensive clothes than you walking by and giving you six kinds of stinkeye. The chance for scrutiny among the Magic subculture was way too high. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, that's my defense. I never would have thought that Magic would have been such an open wound for some, nor did I intend to be condescending. It was more of a "Jesus Christ" of "How can you put yourself on the line like that" more than a "Jesus Christ you fucking loser," if you cotton on to my meaning.

      Epicurus has an excellent point. While Magic was much more exposed a hobby, Warhammer was infinitely less casual. I had a good-sized army of Lizardmen back in the day, and whenever they were discovered by a non-Warhammer guest, I would receive a resounding "Where the  <em>fuck</em>  is your life?" Not to mention the sense of absurdity that follows walking into the local hobby shop with a thirty dollar bill and exiting with a small box of plastic.

      It really is. I still don't care for this strip, because I think it's lazy writing on Onstad's part. Even within the bounds of a D&D joke, this had the potential to be a lot funnier. It relies on stereotypes, and a lot of other writers have already made essentially the same joke and done it better. <br/>

      Well, okay.  But put Gygax as a distant third, since his work so heavily drew upon the first two.  Still, he began the process of systemization that shaped the games and stories of today.   <br/>

      I wouldn't say Gygax drew on Tolkein and Lovecraft. his contribution is completely different.  If not for Gygax, we wouldn't have the basic mathematical framework for the leveling system in nearly ALL point-driven RPGs.  sure, his original systems have evolved and become better over the years, but you can tell that his original leveling designs are in there.  In a way, Gygax's legacy lives on in every MMORPG on the market today.

      Oh yes, and the elves, dwarfs, and halflings in D&D resemble the elves, dwarfs, and hobits of Tolkein not at all?  I think that we all forget that all of these writers have drawn heavily upon the folklore of old.  Faefolk, spiders, horrors in the night, these all draw upon the fears of humanity throughout western history.

      a guy in eyeliner with an steeply angled pink-and-black haircut once yelled "I RUN CHICAGO" at a Taco Bell I was sitting in.  He had gotten called an untoward name by some more thuggish types, apparently.

      No. Riot were at their commercial peak when I was three. At that point, I was more of a fan of funny shapes and sounds.  <br/>

When I was fifteen, I only liked The Dead Milkmen and The Red Hot Chili Peppers (and no, I don't know how that worked logically, but there's no accounting for taste). I only opened up to metal in my early twenties (and even then, only to a certain extent). <br/>

      When I was a freshman in high school, I used to play D&D with a group of older hesher guys who were all around 19 or 20. One of them, the Dungeon Master in fact, had THIS EXACT HAIRCUT. As Argent explained, it was quite popular with the metallers and industrio/goth people of the mid 90's. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As a side note, I was later deflowered by the very same DM's lovely younger sister (she was my age), who seemed to take an interest in me after having seen me at her house, playing D&D with her brother. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess the moral of the story is that, despite the conventional stereotyping, playing Dungeons & Dragons actually caused me to LOSE my virginity. <br/>

      I wouldn't say it's too soon, and I'm sure Gygax's family has a sense of humor about the whole thing if they do stumble upon any sort of comedic send-up of his legacy.

      Maybe it would be strange, so good point there, definitely. Still though, I don't really see what aspect of this comic would be considered demeaning to Gary Gygax's memory.  It mocks the average player of his game, yes, but it doesn't insult the game itself, and most assuredly not the creator.  Any member of his family shocked and dismayed to see that people make a little fun of DnD fans is some sort of cave troll.  I wouldn't use this comic as the visual aide for his eulogy or anything, but I don't think anyone would think its a pointed jab at their relative.

      I saw this as more of a tribute, as do other people I'm sure (like chuvak). It's done in a typicially geeky fashion, as befits the occasion and subject o'course. Hell, I'm sure most fans of D&D thought something along the lines of ressurection spells, HP: 0, healing potions and necromancy when they heard the news. <br/> 
Plus, being D&D, it was always going to have jokes made about it.

      I also find it hard to believe that either the late Mr Gygax or his family would find any of this offensive.  Isn't it far better to be remembered as a punchline than to never be remembered at all?  Nobody works in a field for forty-plus years and doesn't find at least parts of it absurd.

      If he's taunting anyone, it's the general stereotype of the people who play, not the dude himself. But I don't think it's even that - it's not like Onstad is some kind of jock who beats up nerds and takes their lunch money. Given his admitted interest in text adventures, I'm sure he's spent many an afternoon rolling dice in a dank basement. It's more of a self-deprecating parody/homage if anything. I'm surprised more people don't understand this mode (which I think has pretty much become the dominant cultural norm) and cling instead to the old notion that you must either be making fun of something or praising it directly.

      Gamer girls are nae so scarce as people think. I proudly GM a few games in a couple different systems, and although players kind of cycle in and out sometimes, I've had quite a few times when there were more girls than guys. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the record, none of us are fat, none of us are particularly hideous and none of us have mullets/shortlongs. My girlfriend is one the most devoted players, and she's gorgeous and dark-blonde. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But we really are probably the exception to the rule; I've known plenty of my fellow gamers that start to sizzle under sunlight.

      Seriously. Papyrus. Damn. The go-to font for every high school history assignment that starts with the phrase "imagine you are ...". The font of choice to announce any half-baked presentation of a scene from Shakespeare in an intramural drama class. The font that art directors scroll to with a shaking hand when it's 4am and they have to crap out a jacket for another terrible fantasy novel. The only font worthy of that fake "aged" paper you can buy at Staples if you're too doubly-useless to treat your Hammermill with tea and an oven.  <strong>THE FONT OF THEME WEDDINGS</strong>

      We had a pretty fun game of AD&D going one time, with a player like that/you. The antics were hilarious at the beginning, but it got old and predictable real quick. Thing was, the GM had spent a long time designing a really cool and detailed campaign which was supposed to last all summer, and everybody (except the plan-wrecker character) was looking forward to playing it through. Sadly the disruptive player was so disruptive we all just lost interest. I guess maybe he had some fun, at least. Did you?

      Just seconding Susurrus. Like donut shops, role playing games attract many folks of questionable mind and body. But many stylishly-haired, girl-friended, interestingly-employed people enjoy tasty treats too, and know how to consume them responsibly. We treat our games like a movie or computer game that we're creating together. We're writers and actors or just anyone who's ever left the Matrix and fantasized about kicking ass in slow-mo. We don't wait for some company to create the fictions we want, we make them ourselves. <br/>

Really -- take away the "playing DND," and substitute "playing poker," or just "drinking beer" and you can find, all over the country, sad groups of older men still stuck in their home towns sitting around a table at 3AM.

      I liked the above idea about the characters playing D&D.  They should play it grownup style, with drinks for missed saving throws or crit misses, and porno for critical hits.  We played that way in college (we had the internet, so porno was readily available). <br/> 
 <br/> 
It always devolves into everyone 'becoming' dragons.  LARPing even breaks out on accident, mostly in the form of thrown dice.  That's where you need to stop the game.  I regret going further every morning, when I put in this glass eye. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We even did a remove an article of clothing bit when you died.  God that was homoerotic.  I would buy every Achewood book on earth to see all the guys sitting around a table, Teodor passed out, Lyle naked, with like, a d4 embedded in Beef's forehead.  Ray would be the DM, and he would have a pointy hat on, and somewhere a woman's uterus would be sealing shut.

      I might be speaking purely anecdotally, but I think ironically the people who would be more offended by this strip are the people that it reflects less accurately. Yeah, there are people just like the comic portrays - I've seen them, met them, and interacted with them. And they're likely to laugh at this because it's somewhat true. The people who are going to be more irritated are the people who don't see themselves like this (whether or not that self-perception is accurate - as it often is and often isn't - is irrelevant). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't get me wrong. There is a metric shit-ton of potential comedy material to be had from lampooning D&D and the people who play it, and I laugh heartily at a lot of it. But this strip feels like either a really lazy attempt to lampoon D&D, or an attempt to lash out (or perhaps stir up shit) for whatever reason. The alt-text is a prime example; hell, it even contradicts the last panel!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Shitting out the equivalent of "lol girls don't play D&D lol gamers don't get laid lol" is tired and lazy; joking about girls that play D&D being severely neurotic and stirring up a lot of shit and destroying friendships is a hell of a lot more funny and clever. (You can probably tell that I found the last panel to be the most humorous.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Again, as with the last strip; good idea, but I'm not sold on the execution.

      I dunno...all this indignation seems a little silly to me.  A little "sour grapes."  Notice that everyone who doesn't think it's funny tends to have some personal gaming experience (not that I don't, btw).  They're claiming they don't mind being made fun of, but that this strip just isn't funny.  I hung out with a lot of gamers and comics nerds, ate lunch in the chem lab, etc, and I thought this strip was dead on.  PLUS, I don't even think the joke here is that, as you put it, "lol girls don't play D&D" or anything like that.  It's just sort of observational humor about a certain demographic.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
This whole issue reminds me of someone who's just had his ass handed to him in Street Fighter II.   <br/>

      Usually I'd be in agreement; when Onstad's on his game he can make something that's been done ten thousand times before funny as hell. This one just doesn't quite go the distance from tired cliche to tired cliche with a twist that makes it hilarious again.

      I couldn't get into it, coming straight from the last panel describing the foibles of one female gamer's impact on the group. As I mentioned in another post, "lol girls don't play D&D lol" is a tired and unfunny cliche, and really doesn't work for anyone who has known girls who play D&D... but "lol girls who play D&D are fucking nuts" is a hell of a lot more rewarding in every respect.

      ...fuck it.  Let's throw down! <br/> 
 <strong>Artifacts and Achewater</strong> <br/> 
 <em>The Roleplaying Game of the Experience</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Introduction: What is a Roleplaying Game? <br/> 
 --See above comic. <br/> 
 --Glossary: PC - Player Character, the guys playing this game; d6 - Six-sided die; HD - Harrowing Die; Do8 - Die of Eights. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Chapter 1:</strong>  Character Creation <br/> 
 --There are many characters like it, but this one is yours.  Every character has a  <em>Name</em>  (unless they Do Not Have A Name; see below),  <em>Character Class</em> ,  <em>Artifact,</em>  and  <em>Action.</em>   Name these, which are called Aspects, and your character is made. <br/> 
 --Example Character: Name - On-Fire Tiberius; Class - Presumed Mortician; Artifact - Weighted Sponge; Action - Chide disdainfully, like a mother. <br/> 
 ---Nameless Characters: If your character Does Not Have A Name, write it down as a name. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Chapter 2:</strong>  Starting the Game <br/> 
--Each character chooses part of their character--name, artifact, or perhaps a body part not otherwise listed on the character sheet--and rolls one Harrowing Die, starting with the player closest to the nearest television and from there going to the player to his right, and so on, until there are no more people who may roll.  (If a Harrowing Die is not found, substitute a four-sided die.) <br/> 
 -On a result of 1, the part is beneficial to the player, and he may start in a chamber of his choice based on the aspect or body part chosen, and further starts with 1 extra Honor.  For instance, Gouda chooses his Rubbing Knife and rolls a 1 on his HD; he chooses to start in his mother's kitchen, testing bread with his Rubbing Knife. <br/> 
-On a result of 2 or 3, the PC to your right at the table (or beneath you in an Internet chat) chooses a chamber based on that aspect or body part.  It must be a neutral place of no great import to the aspect or body part. <br/> 
-On a 4, the chamber is cruel indeed, and you are in much shame with your aspect or body part there and subtract one Honor from your first die roll.  A PC to your left chooses where you have begun.  For example, "Butchers" Anthony has chosen his name, and rolls a 4 on his Harrowing Die.  He begins in the Butchers' Hand Chamber, as chosen by the PC to his left, and with his Rubber Kid Rock CD, he is seen as an insult to the butcher's profession. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Chapter 3: Honor</strong> <br/> 
 -Once the chamber has been chosen by the Harrowing Die, each PC must roll one d6 to represent starting Honor.  Add one or subtract one based on the whim of the Harrowing Die. <br/> 
-Honor is like the hawk; if you run out, you are in trouble with ecological agencies.  If you go into the negatives, hoo boy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Chapter 4:</strong>  Combat <br/> 
--Now you're in trouble!  The last PC to roll must confront his situation.  If he has rolled a 1, he must find trouble either by starting it at the bar, where an old man will give him a treasure map to an abandoned constabulary haunted by goblins, or by finding the other PCs; this does not count as his turn. <br/> 
-If you are in trouble or neutrality--as indicated by a result of 2, 3, or 4--you may confront or immediately start some trouble.  Declare your ire with the player to your right, who assumes the role of someone or some thing that is preventing you from being more honorable (a large monster shark, an oncoming midmorning nap, the Book of Kells).  Once done verbally sparring, roll one d6, each of you; the one who has rolled higher has lost.  If it is you who are victorious, gain Honor equal to the margin of victory.  If you have lost, you lose Honor equal to the margin of loss.  If it is a tie, you have not yet resolved your problem and must mull over it without gain or loss of Honor; once you have made combat, your turn ends, and the player to your right then must resolve his problem, and so on. <br/> 
--You may choose one aspect to bet on a roll.  Find some way to use that aspect to best your problem, and you may subtract 1 from your battle roll.  If you succeed on the bet-upon combat, you cannot use that aspect again this session.  If you fail, your die is replaced with the dreaded Die of Eights, and you lose Honor as if you had rolled an Eight. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Chapter Five:</strong>  Winning the Game <br/> 
--When initiative has returned to the original player, mark that One Turn Has Passed using a die, paper, or folded paper swan. <br/> 
-When five One Turn Has Passedes have passed, the player who has come out with the most Honor is the victor.  He may then sprinkle rennet upon the losers. <br/> 
-A player who reaches negative Honor is immediately a loser, and must drive everyone to Taco Bell without the option of requesting gas money. <br/> 
-In the case of a tie, you may roll the Harrowing Die once again, once for each tied player, and whosoever comes out on top has barely eked out fortune's favor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The end. <br/>

      To my knowledge, nerds never "just come over". If it hasn't been planned at LEAST one day in advance (and that is pushing it), they'll just be like, "No, dude... Not tonight..." and shy back into a dark corner of the internet for the rest of the evening, while you sit at home, alone and bored, talking to your nerdy friend online when you could be hanging out together  <em>right now.</em> <br/>

      Is there much of D&D going on in Australia?? Come on kiddies, I know you're out there. You see, I like metal, Monty Python, (used to) like reading fantasy novels.

      People are taking this way too seriously.  If this webcomic strip has stereotyped gamers at all, it might be only that gamers have no sense of humor about themselves. <br/>

Which...as I think about it, might be understandable, considering they probably spent all four years of high school as ridiculed outcasts. <br/>

      Has anyone here ever seen the Scottish movie  <em>Gamerz</em> ? It's incredibly terrible. It's about a group of RPGers and I guess some weird drama starts up between them? I couldn't understand a word they were saying because they were Scottish and there weren't any subtitles. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the best part of the movie is when the one girl in the group (who is, of course, hot and goth) shouts during a particularly "exciting" moment in the game, "I've got a healing spell!" Read it in your head with a thick Scottish accent. It was hilarious.

      This strip was kind of surreal for me because I actually do know a huge D&D nerd who moved to Colorado with his first-ever girlfriend, although she already had a kid in this case. To be fair, a chemistry PhD is more promising than the promise of owning an Arby's. Last I heard, they were still together and reasonably happy, although the guy has Beef-like depression.

      You know, Leland from "Dog the Bounty Hunter" has that exact hairdo in today's uncertain world.  I would not have pegged him as a D&D guy.  I guess it must be like lupus, you know, the symptoms are legion.

It's funny, there's really no doubt about that, but so are some terribly racist jokes.  I can't like this at all, and I refuse to apologize for that.  Lame away.

      Onstad must have played some  <em>raw</em>  DnD in his time, the knowledge displayed in this comic is too intimate to have been written by an outsider.

      Seeing RPGer beefs down look makes me notice, though he's got depression, we don't usually see beef frown when nothing particularly bad is going on at the moment. Which is accurate about the depressed people I know. It must indicate that this is an extra depressing situation.
