      Hey, the Intarwebs say Dirty Antaeus and Pogo are right, even though I thought they were wrong! That's a neat concept! <br/>

Drop Kick Pikachu is correct insofar that waking up on the floor with a brand new exit wound and a boner the size of Apollo's is rather perspective-changing, though.

      Absolutely. But there's no  <em>arousal</em> . Don't go asking me specific questions about the human nervous system, but after my bad shock, I was dazed, disoriented, experiencing gaps in motor use, and had a bigger boner than I've ever had before or since, presumably triggered by something south of the conscious or subconscious mind. Hell of boundary-challenging.

      "Electrocution" is my favourite 20th Century marketing-word portmanteau. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's a snazzy combination of "electric" and "execution", first coined to describe the purpose of the electric chair. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Why settle for stuffy old executions when you have the wonder of ELECTRO-cution to kill people?

Chomsky is basically like one of those academics who is all heck of unsuited for the discipline he's actually trained in but used the post-sixties homogenization of the humanities and social sciences that resulted from the migration of continental philosophers into the aforementioned fields immensely. It's just that unlike most of them his actual areas of interest relate to explicit constructs instead of implicit ones.
