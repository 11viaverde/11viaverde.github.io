      Onstad once said something in his blog (I think) about not revealing which Achewood character he is most like in real-life because he enjoys the speculation among his fans. I think it is Phillipe. When he writes other characters like Pat or Ray, he portrays them accurately but never goes too deep. We all know an uptight, repressively-homosexual vegan with a superiority complex (probably not all in one person) or a partying, selfish lady's man. But Onstad writes Phillipe from deep within, with the understanding of an awkward child's mind you can only get from experience. He is probably part Beef too, as someone like Phillipe would grow up to be someone like Beef. OK, Freud-talk is over.

      here are two interesting quotations from chris onstad, taken from  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101102221213/https://www.orato.com/node/2332/&amp;page=3">page 3 of the online orato interview</a> : <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>"You could probably say the characters in Achewood are built around literally six people I know."</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
and <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>"I enjoy writing Ray, Roast Beef and Téodor the most, because they%u2019re the largest aspects of my own personality."</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
prior to reading this interview, i always guessed it was roast beef and téodor.  i would guess you've gotta have some serious first-hand personal darkness to write beef.

      I posted this elsewhere, but I might as well state such here: <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm positive his "mouthpiece" character is Téodor. He was the original main character, he's the most down-to-earth and everyman-ish of them all, and his interest in certain things (such as computers and music) seems to be just enough to match what Onstad's would have to be to be able to write knowledgeably. In the subscription area there's one strip with Téodor doing stand-up, and Onstad actually says in the caption that this was Chris himself trying to do stand-up and realizing that his jokes don't work that way.

      I also suspect that Teodor is little more than Chris in a tiny bear suit. Onstad desires mope-ass chicks with flat eric tattoos.

      Because at first he is knocking and then as he gets angrier he starts banging. I always considered a knock to be using the second set of knuckles and banging to be hitting the door with the bottom of your fist.
