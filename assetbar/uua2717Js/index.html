      Let's all share stories of terrible first kisses.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mine was at 19-20, outside a friend's house with this terribly overweight blonde girl that ended up dumping me on valentine's because  i didn't pay that much attention to her. I find it endlessly amusing that it was outside my friend's house, she just happened to live nearby and that was the house she chose to put the moves on me.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Being dumped  on valentine's has been sort of a recurrent theme in my life, interestingly.

      Mine was awesome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
During a game a Pictionary, I was supposed to draw the word "kiss". I could not draw it adequately and the timer ran out. Later, a girl mocked my drawing ability, specifically the placement of the noses ("they'd bump into each other"). I replied "so the noses go to the side.. like this?" and planted one on her lips. <br/>

      Wow, I guess I was precocious. Way young, like second grade, we playing %u201CKissing Tag,%u201D where if you got caught, you got kissed.  The girl in the neighborhood who was in charge of everything invented it. She also got to be the Queen all the time, and often chose me as her king.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Later, in a different state, I guess it was fourth grade, a very lovely young lady at a record hop decided she wanted to kiss.  I love kissing to this day.   <br/>

Oh, there was a long drought until high school, all nervous like you all were saying.  Then I got into it and kissed every girl I could for many years.

      Hmm, I think I've actually had 3 different ~significant~ first kisses. <br/> 
First ever/first with a girl: I was eleven, almost twelve, and had just realized the night before at a sleepover that I was weirdly attracted to my best friend and might be bisexual; we were playing Truth or Dare, and another friend couldn't come up with a dare for her, so I told the other friend to dare the girl to kiss me. Very awkward, but still amusing. <br/> 
First real: Twelve and a half, two days after getting together with what would be my first ~serious~ girlfriend; it was the school Valentine's Day dance and it had a fifties theme--in order to be ~rebellious~, we dressed vaudeville. She pulled me off into the corner of the gym, I grabbed her by the tie I had lent her, and it was First Makeout City. <br/> 
First with a guy: Fourteen, with a rebound from a long-term online boyfriend. He asked me out after knowing me for just the first two days of school, we walked to this Asian teahouse place after school, and we said basically at the same time "Uhh this is awkward but I kinda want to kiss you." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Why am I incapable of making a short post on Assetbar?

      I was on a date with a girl, she was playing with her hair and I had a hunch I had done a good job flirt-wise, and I said, "What was I saying? Oh, yeah. I'm fairly certain I'm going to have to kiss you now." <br/> 
 <br/> 
And she said, "Oh, really?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Maybe more than fairly," I said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I laid one on her. She said, "That was bold of you." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Well, bold's my middle name." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Is that so?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"No. It's Jackson." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Later she told me that I had clearly kissed girls before. I had not. I learned it from a porno.

      My first kiss was ridiculously saccharine. I'm not ashamed of it, though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was one month shy of 17 (Yeah, I wasn't a late bloomer, but I was a late being-able-to-get-a-girlfriender), and I'd been dating this girl for about a month (I took things reeeeally slow). It was on her front lawn, conveniently hidden from the view of her younger siblings trying to watch through the window by a bush. We'd had a running joke about kissing on the forehead before the lips (I'm a foot taller than she is), so I pulled her close, gave her my best badass smoldering look, kissed her forehead, smirked, then planted one on her lips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was surprised how confident I was for a first kiss... But we've now been together for a year and a half, still in love, and are engaged. Covertly, since her parents don't really approve of me, and she doesn't graduate from high school for another year and a half. It hasn't been as smooth and fairy-tale as it sounds, but sentimental sucker that I am, I really do love her.

      Good call. <br/>

Making out while stoned and cottonmouthed, however, is a completely different story.

      Making out while stoned is the most fun ever! Although maybe not cottonmouthed. I always made sure there were plenty of beverages around. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Man, you just made me nostalgic for when I was a sort-of stoner and had a boyfriend. These two states of being were not unrelated.

      You know what they say about girls who smoke! <br/>

That maybe you could talk to them if you smoke also, and maybe you could make a joke or something to keep their attention.

      I got my first kiss at 12 with my friend Amanda. I was curious what all the fuss was about so she planted one on the lips, which led to stone cold makin' out. Which led to several more years of makin' out. Come to think of it, she deflowered me too.
