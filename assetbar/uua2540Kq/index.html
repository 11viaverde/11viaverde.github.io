I know everyone jumps up and yells 'who cares?' but being as OCD as I am, I keep trying and failing to imagine the mindset of LiquidCruelty as he went down the page laming every comment. What in the hell would possess you to do this, even after it was being commented on? WHY??? The fact that I will never have an answer bothers me greatly.

      He can't just straighten it out like it is because that one block sticking up would stop it from making any lines.  He could rotate it like 80 degrees clockwise, but then he'd have two vertical lines with stuff hangin' off one of 'em, which would still be problematic.  And it's probably impossible to rotate it in increments that aren't multiples of 90 degrees anyway.  He doesn't have a lot of options.

      Well I don't think that the piece is in mid-turn I think it came out of the top at that weird angle.  That's why it's depression because it's coming in at a weird angle and you know you can't do anything about it and also know that the next pieces will result in a slow and arduous trip towards game over.

      Whoever transcribed this said that the block is shaped like phallus. I won't go into the Freudian aspects, but holy shit if the transcriptor is reading this you are a hella fucked up dude. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Any ideas for what it could be? The other impossible tetris strip (with the omega symbol) is titled "the ardbeg and the omega," and that thing does look vaguely like the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413123842/https://www.ardbeg.com/">Ardbeg symbol</a> . I'm not entirely convinced, though.

      First glance at this strip, I thought the tetris piece looked like a phallus and there's a gap that is much too small for it and I thought this was supposed to represent Beef's fear at what Pete might be doing to Phillipe. Which is hella disturbing

However, finish rotating it and you'll clear 2 lines and have a canal to put a straight piece in and clear another 2. Ain't so bad.

      I think what makes this strip truly excellent is that not only is the shape impossible to fit well in Tetris, but that it's at a  <em>slight angle,</em>  meaning that it VIOLATES EVERY LAW OF THE GAME, which is in my opinion an excellent depiction of how Roast Beef's mind works.
