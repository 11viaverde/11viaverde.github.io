      Holy cow, you're right... I apologize for laming you! I thought, OK, Eno did the Windows 95 startup sound, so you must have them mixed up, and also, mildly, who the hell would claim that Fripp would let Microsoft commission him? ([url="https://www.robertfripp.com/diaries.htm?entry=2860"]OK, fine, Fripp would.[/url]) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Peter Gabriel must be lined up for the next big MS OS release. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And, finally, to answer centipede_damascus: Fripp played guitar on David Bowie's "Fashion" and "Heroes", to cite 2 arguably best-known examples.

      I'd have to look it up, but I'm fairly it's his Roland GR-300 guitar synth which means it's a synthesizer controlled by a guitar.  So he is playing a guitar, the sounds are just triggered by Voltage-controlled oscillators, yielding seemingly impossible guitar sounds for that time.

      Alright, I did the research. The  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_GR-500">GR-500</a>  was the first commercially available guitar synthesizer, released in 1977. The  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/https://www.joness.com/gr300/">GR-300</a>  is a floor-based unit designed to be used with the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/https://www.joness.com/gr300/G-303.htm">G-303 Guitar Controller</a> . This setup was most prominently used by  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Metheny#Guitar_Synthesizer">Pat Metheny</a>  and was released in 1980.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Green_World">Another Green World</a>  was released in November 1975. In the liner notes of the album, Fripp is credited with playing the "Wimshurst Guitar", but this is merely a reference to the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimshurst_Machine">Wimshurst Generator;</a>  ""...on 'St. Elmo's Fire' I had this idea and said to Fripp, 'Do you know what a Wimshurst machine is?' It's a device for generating very high voltages which then leap between the two poles, and it has a certain erratic contour, and I said, 'You have to imagine a guitar line that has that, very fast and unpredictable.' And he played that part which to me was very Wimshurst indeed." -Brian Eno, 1979. The liner notes read "Robert Fripp: Wimshurst-Guitar on 'St. Elmo's Fire', Restrained-Guitar on 'I'll Come Running', Wimborne-Guitar on 'Golden Hours'." Nowhere does it mention synthesizer guitar and as you can see, Eno was eccentrically accurate in describing the way Fripp played in each song. In the Wikipedia entry for  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101003200115/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_Fire_%28song%29">St. Elmo's Fire</a>  it mentions that Fripp contributes "a  <strong>guitar</strong>  (emphasis mine) solo to the song. Legato, speedy and distorted, the solo stands at counterpoint with the piano lines."

      Wow, good show.  I thought  <em>Another Green World</em>  was released later than that due to the prevalance of a seemingly polyphonic monotimbral synthesizer which I figured for a Prophet 5.  Considering the time he was working with David Byrne and that  <em>Another Green World</em>  really has little in common with  <em>Here Comes the Warm Jets</em> , I figured it was closer to '79-'81.

      First, the fact that you mentioned Here Come the Warm Jets is awesome, seems like most people who listen to Eno forget that he ever made anything but Ambient, and this bothers me. <br/> 
Second, I would have to argue that except for the massive amount of instrumentals on Another Green World the only other big difference is the lack of nasal in the vocals. Although this does make them quite different they don't seem too far apart to me. <br/> 
They seem nearer than Taking Tiger Mountain (by Strategy) and either of the albums.

The mix tape further sells a comic that would have been a high-water mark for anyone else. I like to think that 'mix tape' is just a generous way of describing one song over and over again, but there's no basis for that.
