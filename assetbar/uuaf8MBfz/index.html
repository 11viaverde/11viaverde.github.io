It looks like Ray lives up in the big ol' mansion part of Palo Alto, while Beef lives over in the extremely poor ghetto of East Palo Alto.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The fictional Onstads & co live over where a lot of Stanford University people do.  And everybody else seems to be in the middle-class suburb parts (ok, not any more, housing is $$$$$ now). <br/>

And Todd lives on the golf course.

      It's presumably the PA muni dump which on this map would be just east by northeast of the Seven Pines golf course. Which in Palo Alto is municipal. There's also an airport out there, some baylands, and the occasional teenage makeout couple/guy smoking crack in his truck.

      I like that you told me specifically, rather than commenting on the strip in general. It feels like we were standing next to each other in a bar, having no reason to talk or acknowledge each other, perhaps not even looking in each other's direction, perhaps I'm already involved in a conversation with someone else (mulisha7), and then out of the blue you nudged me and got my attention and gave me your opinion. <br/>
