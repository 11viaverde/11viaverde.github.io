      Steve DeNeuve is a good man, but few people like him. He would never harm a woman, but they feel uncomfortable being alone with him. It isn't his fault that he upsets people. The Good Lord saw fit to give him a cleft palate and the cold little eyes of a lobster. He makes a living as best he can, transporting animals across country. Then he goes home to his large, tidy flat, to eat microwave meals and watch documentaries.

      The Pleasure of My Company: A Novel by Steve Martin <br/> 
 <br/> 
Publishers Weekly <br/> 
 <br/> 
Martin's first novella, Shopgirl (2000), was a revelation, a compassionate yet cool, meticulously crafted tale of a young woman's affair with an older, successful man not what most readers were expecting from the famed comic actor and author of Pure Drivel. Martin's second novella continues the enjoyment, offering another story with a conscience, one funnier than Shopgirl but put together just as smartly, if very differently. Martin forgoes the distanced omniscient narration of Shopgirl by plunking readers into the head of one the odder yet more charming protagonists in recent fiction, Daniel Pecan Cambridge, a gentle soul suffering from a mild mix of autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Daniel, 33, lives in a rundown Santa Monica apartment, his life constricted by an armor of defensive habit (all the lightbulbs in his apartment must equal 1,125 watts; he can't step over curbs so can cross streets only where two opposing driveways align, etc.), his dull days punctuated only by imagined romances and visits by his student social worker, lovely and kind Clarissa. Daniel's ways (a product of child abuse, Martin shows with subtlety) are challenged when Clarissa and her infant son, Teddy, move in to escape an abusive husband; when Daniel wins a contest as "Most Average American" and must give a speech to claim the $5,000 prize; and when his beloved grandmother dies, sending him on a road trip of discovery back home. This novella is a delight, embodying a satisfying story arc, a jeweler's eye for detail, intelligent pacing and a clean, sturdy prose style. What's most remarkable about it, though, is its tenderness, a complex mix of wit, poignancy and Martin's clear, great affection for his characters. Many readers are going to love this brief, big-hearted book. Agent, Esther Newberg. 250,000 first printing; major ad/promo, including Today Show appearance.

      As far as I can work out Steve is either going through some sort of traumatic flashback to a time when he forgot to ask for his mother for his favorite dish, or he's just hoping that Phillipe's mother will ask him in for some of that buttered rice. Dude likes butter. That much is clear.

      discreet - adjective, careful not to attract attention or give offence.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
discrete - adjective, individually separate and distinct.  <br/> <br/> <br/> I can't figure out why people (or a particular country) spell 'centre' as 'center', but don't then go on to use words like 'centeral' and 'centerifugal'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The US still has 'acre' and 'mediocre', though. So there are times when US English does remember that 're' can be pronounced 'er'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I eagerly await the purging of the confusing 'le' ending! Bottel! Cattel! Battel! <br/>

      According to google, the drive should take somewhere in the ballpark of 40 hours.  With A guy like Steve Deneuve we're gonna see less time than that  Time zones add an effective 2 hours to the trip.  The two animals left Achewood at roughly 6 AM, and arrived in Ohio in darkness, which means (early in the month of April) sometime between 8 PM and 7 AM. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Assuming they left at 6 am in California, the 40 hour estimate gets them to Ohio around midnight of the next day.  Even if Steve Deneuve moves faster than Google maps predicts, they could be expected to arrive sometime after 8 that night. <br/>

      Google is also unnecessarily concerned with speed limits.  Consider... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Achewood is in the San Francisco Bay Area, I think it has been established. To travel back to the midwest, most of the journey would take place on I-80.  Once you get east of Reno, NV, the unofficial highway speed of I-80 is somewhere between 85 and 170 MPH.

I think the idea is mostly abandoned now, but I was never quite sure how the Underground worked. It seems like Achewood the area was not actually Underground, just the shops and bars. Onstad wouldn't be living in the Underground, and Ray's house seems to be close to Onstad's.

      I feel like this is an ok time to mention my theory that Cartilage Head has a fetish for being an abandoned dying man.  <br/> 
He lures men into his home, feeds them the wine from the bottle of empty wine, and then subjects them to his 'suicide,' only to stalk them to their homes and place daguerreotypes with a caption to accuse them of being a normal human.  <br/> 
I will not here address that he lured Beef to his death, attempted to profit from it, and then abandoned him, only to accuse Beef of the crime that he [Cartilage Head] had just committed. <br/> 
TL;DR...  <br/> 
Cartilage Head still has one bone, which he gets from forcing men to abandon him when he's dying. <br/> 
Fucking. <br/> 
Gross.

 <br/> 
she'd also sing to me when i went to bed as a child n suntines,  <em>suntines</em> , when i m alone i hum the tune (the tune no more than a hum itself for she didnt know the words) n it fills me wit joys, memries o all teh thing she done for me n i know some yall dont like ur moms for w/e reason but i jus gotta stress dat they ya moms no matter wat n 4 yall 2 not hold 2 much stuff against them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i was forcibly fed soup by my mom, she made me apologise 2 my brother even tho i did nothing wrong, she used to spank me when i was truely young, she'd 'yell' through gritted teeth if i misbehaved in public. (that was weird) but most of all. <br/>

      Man I don't agree with all this hating on Steve. He is a well-groomed man with a rather presidential face. He is good at what he does. Furthermore, I imagine many people open up with children when they are alone with one; there's something about the power imbalance, and lack of adult understanding, that makes all children easy to talk to, and somewhat of an archetypal symbol of your own personal lost childhood. <br/>
