      I imagine, though, that Pat would immediately go off on how sliders are terrible for you and "mailbox baseball" can cause you inhale microscopic lead paint dust, end up offering Nice Pete a plate of fermented, fair-trade, pistachio-based "un-burgers" instead, and promptly be creatively bludgeoned to death with the remnants of T's cheeseburger.

I was into Chug Nathan's Giant Hog's first EP, hosted a basement show for them and stuff. But their full-length after they signed to Sub-Pop just fell flat, man. And their set at SXSW this year was really weak.

      I don't know. As I have understood it there has always been a strange three way relationship between Pat, Nice Pete and Rod Huggins. I like the idea that Pat is such a dick that he's openly two timing on a known murderer and probable psychotic, but avoids getting stabbed out of a mixture of chutzpah and dumb chance. I think, deep down, Pete truly loves Pat. Pat on the other hand just likes to have someone to carry the hand-formed tofu protein noodles back to his car.

      nah, i think Pete is just a roommate, despite his first comment to Pat in prison ("do you think that it is bad for a man to give another man kisses, or do you agree that it is okay?")...more than once Chris has alluded to possible "attraction" to both sexes, but more often than not, Pete is painted as a peculiar homosexual and a violent misogynist...as far as any actual sexual activity goes, he strikes me as the kind of guy who doesn't get down unless it will help him commit a crime

      I must be a stupid.   For all the strips (and other of Onstad's media) indicating Nice Pete's terrible attitudes toward women and, as I see now, possible homosexuality, it didn't occur to me that he might be gay.   Sheesh...   I'ma have to re-read some archives, "shucks"!   ...On the other hand, it never occurred to me to think about his sexuality at all, which all things considered is probably a Good Thing...

      it should be noted, and consequently has been below by myself and scorpio_nadir, that Onstad is  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000026/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua7B2j1h#comment_134">SPYING ON US.</a> <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em> shatneresque  » neu  3 months ago<br/>
Most of Emily Dickinson's poetry can be sung to the tune of The Yellow Rose of Texas, the Gilligan's Island theme song, or a good majority of hymns.</em></div> <br/> 
This rapid swing of events, completely belaying the Appalachian Chinchillern Sexfest, is his way of telling us "I'm watching you. Cocks." <br/> 
I mean.. He could be reading anything that we post. Like even  <strong>right now.</strong>   <br/> 
I don't know about you, but I believe that we should be free to post on whatever topics we choose without fear of it being  <strong>read</strong>  by some power-hungry voyeur with a throbbing hardon for  <strong>reading.</strong> <br/> 
America owns the internet, and as such our blessed and beautiful constitutional rights should extend to  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">everyone</span>  else online as well, even those lesser countries. I am not as yet certain which amendment covers this, but it covers it because America has the best constitution of all constitutions that have been written to date and as such will cover it. And before anyone else says it, that's right buddy if you don't want some red white and blue (not french) freedom, then you do terrorisms and supply terror to be used against our great nation. <br/> 
So tl;dr, we should stand together and demand that Onstad read our message of freedom, and then insist that he not read them any further from that point on, even if they are not freedom-based.

It's like how in elementary school they'd have us fill out these worksheets where there would be little pictures of things and a blank, and you wrote in the word which appropriately in context was a homophone to the little picture, but when they had a little picture of a witch, supposedly standing for "which," I was all like "this worksheet gets an F."

      I really liked a few of them, actually. But i think the idea of a single (or two) sup-bar comics is harder to bear when updates are not daily, and maybe you cannot see that because you are embedded in the moment as it unfolds, but from the perspective of someone who, years later, will look through this and be able to click instantly past any comic that is not perfect to see the next one, your comment will look BATSHIT CRAZY OVER-THE-TOP ANGRY. <br/>

      Someone actually did this. Michaelangelo had to change the face angle of his Moses like 12 times because Julius II kept being a dick about it. The statue has a chip on its knee, supposedly from Michaelangelo hitting it with his hammer to make it speak, but I think he was just plain old pissed off by the fact that Caesar wouldn't let him work in peace.

He is in Africa, pursuing college opportunities and being pursued by tribes that would like an exceptionally hefty spear for their chieftain.

      Good thing Nice Pete happened to drive past RB. I love the Dickinson/Gilligan thing. I don't understand panel 27... unless he's comparing the bitemarks in the burger to T's mouth shape.  <br/> 
I hope T's suffering is so great that it wakens an elder god and we can get some Lovecraftian craziness going on. Either that or a car accident. I don't think murderers make for careful drivers.

      With all the band starting going on here it's time it got a contraction. It would lead to confusion when someone was like "Hey, me Ryan and Mike are going to go st'and in my garage, you in?" cause that's something that people around here (mid west USA) might say anyway.

      I'm not so sure about that. It also appears that a good bit of time has passed as it is no longer dark out and is just around dawn. <br/>

Still, as much as I hated Lurquilla I have to say that it still feels sloppy to just jump away from that so fast. I don't want to chow down on Nathan's blessing for twenty minutes and not have him reach total pleasure. It would be like all that unpleasant effort and work was for naught. Finish it up fast, but at least finish it up so we can move on without feeling like it was both unpleasant and a waste.

My best guess is that it is Nathan's from Denny's, but I don't recall seeing either of them actually taking it out of Denny's. Likewise I don't think there would have been a point after exiting the Denny's that Teodor could even have been implied to have taken a bite out of it. Not to mention the general oddity that Nathan and Nice Pete would bring a single burger out and Teodor would take the sole bite out of it, but leave it up front. <br/>

      It's not a real opinion, just that vagaries of nostalgia. Don't you ever have that moment where you fondly remember something from the past, but upon greater reflection it was actually something that was terrible in the past and you didn't really like it that much at the time. Yet now you have feelings about it because of what it reminds you of. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Greater research informs me that Taco Via was actually just a local chain (I had thought it was more widespread), but those Taco Burgers were totally a Thing. I've heard from other people in various areas of similar establishments serving crappy Mexi-style fast food of varying degrees of quality and almost all of them had a Taco Burger and it was almost always a Thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Getting Taco Burgers from whatever the local equivalent would be would be a decidedly High School thing to do.

Del Taco actually makes a decent burger, but I usually go there because it's so awesome to get fries with a burrito.  Weinerschnitzel sells a 99-cent chili cheese fries burrito that is glorious, glorious death. <br/>

      I'm pretty sure Beef is imagining the contours of Teodor's face/mouth area, so as to extrapolate from the bite marks on the burger to produce assurance that his friend is, in fact, in the back of Nice Pete's van - perhaps 'in flagrante', perhaps not.

      Actually this is Emeril calling it "The Far side of the Moon". Emeril is a guy who knows the theme song to Gilligan's Island. I've never seen the show, but I have a feeling it's kind of a lame theme to know the lyrics to. Maybe Emeril likes conspiracy theories more than he likes Floyd, ever think of that?

      Okay I just checked it out on youtube. I still prefer Floyd, though. <br/> 
This show was never big in Europe, so there's probably something wrong with a lot of us over here. <br/>

      I noticed that too; I figured it was a conscious joke meant to suggest that Emeril really had to  <em>reach</em>  to make that connection, and even then it didn't really make sense. <br/> 
I imagine that the aural equivalent of what's written would be Emeril kind of mumbling along unsteadily to the melody, ignoring the actual rhythm.

      Although admittedly that was kind of a freak, distant side effect of Lyle's objection to his role in Mister Band. By the same logic, Chuck Williams being old and about to die resulted in Beef dying in a work of performance art only to avoid reincarnation as a dog and regain his former life. Achewood causality is a bizzare, convoluted Escher-Golderberg machine that someone resembles a game of mousetrap build upside down and on fire. And I love it for that.

      jmd take it easy, that's how it works.. you voice your complaint and when it's fixed, things get back to normal. your crass little term "Onstad worship" is actually what the appropriate reaction to a long-running well-appreciated (free) comic ought to be. nobody is running for public office here. <br/> 
what would be the point of forever holding a grudge against Onstad for it? "well the comic is ok this week but FUCK YOU ONSTAD YOU DIDN'T WRITE  <strong>ALL OF THEM</strong>  PERFECTLY DID YOU. thus I refute you."  <br/> 
you clearly should not be reading this comic or posting in this forum. <br/> 
and I bet you get along GREAT with your ex's.

      Today I was walking down the street and, lo and behold, a white Ford Falcon van. <br/>

One could not help but think "Oh shit that's Nice Pete's van" <br/>

I took a picture on my cell phone that I would like to show you guys, but my cell phone is made of dogshit and fail. And, y'know, IMGS are OFF.

      I never realized how many white vans there were until I was living in the DC Beltway during the Beltway Snipings, and all anyone knew was that someone in a white van was killing suburbanites at random. That mile walk home from high school was never more interesting.

 <em><strong>Is Your Neighbor a Lunatic?</strong><br/>
Does your neighbor display the following qualities:<br/>
- Severely antisocial behavior?<br/>
- Blatant disregard of human and/or animal life?<br/>
- Blatant disregard and/or refusal to accept reality?<br/>
- A grossly unkempt lawn with unsightly objects(ie: flamingos, gnomes, one or more tricycles that have never in the course of habitation been used or touched by a child)?<br/>
If so, then you should consult this pamphlet.<br/>

From there, the way is wide open to Porked-you-gal.  However, the Packed countries would prefer to thrust into the interior of Your-up.  Clearly, a rear action is called for.  As you say, Hung-ary is one option, but they could also try a northerly route through the Nether-lands or the Hard-ennes.  All these options have the advantage that they can be staged from Crack-ow.  But if they go farther south, they could find the invasion to be easier via Grease.  However, they must be careful, for at the end of the day they could find themselves in Bars-alone.

      I knew a man named Dijon a long time ago.  <br/> 
I shot him in the mouth with a flare gun and pushed him off the side of a boat near Tampa because he was embezzling money from our avacado co-op that was a front for illegal bear smuggling for an underground bear Fight Club. <br/> 
I don't know if he liked mustard, but I did not ask because it seemed forward. <br/> 
I did not ever see him eat any.

      I like the bit where the three brothers are attacked by Sam and his gang who are impatient over receiving the drugs from the brothers' native Vietnam. Archer and his brothers later threaten the elder leaders of their gang, when they attempt to intervene. Tiger is later assigned to kill Sam out in public, but the plan backfires when Wilson intervenes. While in hospital, Sam agrees to testify in court against the three brothers. On the night of their mother's birthday, the brothers plan to recover their drug money, but as the heist is being performed, Archer is arrested by Hong Kong police, while Tony and Tiger discover that Wilson is a mole. <br/> 
While in court, Archer is forced to turn in all of his travel documents, in the hopes that he will not flee from Hong Kong before his hearing. Tony and Tiger brutally murder Sam along with several other witnesses and crime figures crucial to the police's investigation. After their first plan to kill Wilson fails, Tony and Tiger decide to sneak into a hospital guarded by the Hong Kong Police Department. Ma discovers that Tiger, disguised as a janitor, is in the building and goes after him. Tony, having kidnapped Wilson's girlfriend, Julie, threatens to kill her, if Wilson, now a sole witness, testifies in court. Ma squares off against Tiger inside a restaurant, and brutally beats him to death in front of a crowd after Tiger severely injures a little girl. During the court hearing, Wilson refuses to testify, and the case is dismissed for lack of evidence. Wilson later attempts to rescue Julie, but is captured by Tony and his gang. <br/> 
Once Archer walks free, Ma holds him captive, and calls his brother, Tony, for an exchange of hostages, leading to a confrontation in a Chinese village. Ma singlehandedly takes on the remaining Triad gang, and engages in a gruelling fight with Tony, who he later arrests.

      I wish I could rate strips just so I could use all my lames on you jmd.  For every minute Onstad spends with his child, family, and real world concerns, you spend an hour bitching about senseless shit.  It's a webcomic, if you don't want to pay him money, don't.  If you want to, do.  It's your choice and has literally nothing to do with his future productivity, you are not putting a down payment on his future work and you do not have a contract with him.  Crying constantly just makes you look like a child and aggravates at least some of the rest of us.

      A rough truth, assetbros: <br/> 
There is as much secondary bitching in response to primary bitching about the comic. <br/> 
There's an "ignore user" button, and bitching is pretty easy to spot, and can be manually ignored. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Quit bitching. Everybody. Everybody. Everybody.

      In my defense multiple posts along the lines of "NO HOW DARE YOU ASK FOR A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT" is toeing the line that I feel exists between expressing onesself and being obnoxious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suppose I am now asking: How many times can the exact same thing be expressed before it is considered to be expressed, already? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another way to put it might be that while this is a place to state your opinion on things, repeating it a number of times is a redundancy that adds nothing to the dialogue here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I see your point about this being a locale for ideas and such but perhaps you can consider that sometimes a discussion can run its course and while more can be said (written) perhaps nothing more is truly  <em>said</em>  ( <em>written</em> ). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Have you ever met someone who talks a lot but says very little?  A cool dude once stated something along the lines of the reason we have two ears and one mouth is so that we can listen twice as much as we speak. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Do you think that it is wrong for a person to have an opinion?  Or do you agree that it is ok?  What if they tell you that opinion, then they reiterate it, then they ennumerate the details of it, then they derail other topics into a statement of it?  Is there a point at which this is the tantrum-style stratagem of a toddler and/or spoiled brat?  Or do you agree that while it is their right the abuse of rights is a distinct possibility? <br/> 
 <br/> 
One time back in life I knew this girl.  Jessica D. She told me about her boyfriend and how much he sucked.  Every day.  Shit, man, every goddamn sentence.  I felt a little bad, and maybe I was wrong about it, but after asking her why she stuck wtih him and such I eventually just avoided her.  Maybe I should have asked her to cut it out?  She seemed pretty cool aside from that annoying habit.  I think her middle name was Mary. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do like this arc, I stated so maybe two times, maybe once?  I think once.  What I did not do is reply to everything in sight with an all caps or otherwise thoguhtless comment on how I liked it.  I am drawing a parallel here, but will let you figure out what I am getting at. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Alright, I'm too drunk to go on.

      I do agree with you here. It seems  some people are saying exactly the same things they said about the previous strip, and that continuing to complain just adds to an unreadable wall of bitching. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess my problem was less with what you were doing and more people who felt the need to respond to these repeat posts. Ratacatt or whatever comes to mind because he/she/it just descended progressively into nonsense and insults for the sake of responding to every post he/she/it didn't agree with. <br/> 
Thanks for your insights. Sorry my ire hit someone not deserving of it.

      Uncomfortable? What's with you people? Do you really empathize so strongly with fictional characters that this bothers you? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really just don't see how this is all that uncomfortable. Do you not have David Lynch where you live? Are you posting from the 50s? Just about everything in this strip is less disturbing than what I encounter in my daily life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Watching a homeless man take a giant, watery crack-shit in a bus shelter both happens more frequently and is more distressing (for a number of reasons).
