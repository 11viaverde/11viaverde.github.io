      As someone who's read all of Achewood, I sadly agree with you. I think we've entered the unintentional self-parody part of a (great) webcomic's decline and fall. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, come on. Really read some of these recent comics. "Massive little man" followed by "little massive man" followed by five more "massive little man"s? Waltz of the Magyar commemorative omelette suggestion pan or whatever the fuck? Four strips of Sharper Image parody? I don't mind occasional misses, but things are getting grim. I haven't really liked an arc in a long time. I mean, go back like 10 comics and you'll find a bunch of "what is the deal with Facebook/reality TV/trends and fads/DMV tests" jokes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I dunno, I'm just bored. And I'm only complaining so much because Achewood is so good when it's good. Whatever, lame away, but I needed to share my feeeeeeeelings.

      I tend to agree, except I thought the recent strip making fun of facebook and youtube was pretty decent.  I really hate strips that are all apolitical.  This current sharper image parody strip has to be at least the 50th or 75th strip Onstad has done in this very distinctive theme of clever puns, sometimes involving graphic design, where the story line merely serves as an excuse for Onstad to riff away with his puns.  It is this clever pun-ish sort of dialogue and perspective that gives achewood it'd distinctive flair and has made it famous.  At it's best it's awesome, but yeah, when it's watered down it's kind of a drag...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I seriously doubt that any of us would mind the strips we are complaining about if they were just doodles done on the side that Onstad posted on his web site... sort of like... scraps from the cutting room floor that weren't good enough to make the cut...  we wouldn't mind that if there were good solid strips in the mean time... It almost seems unfair to criticize this stuff in lieu of good solid achewood strips.  It's sad that we're almost not seeing anymore the classic solid achewood strips we used to see...  But at the same time I'm wary of beating to death the goose that lays the golden egg...  It's hard to do, but we should be willing to allow Onstad to go down a particular tangent if he wants to, should we not?...  If he's not feeling particularly inspired, is he required to shut down his web site and hang a shingle that says "out to lunch will return in X days?"  I think it's kind of part of the bargain, this reality that Achewood is a deal where Onstad publishes whatever the fuck he wants, when he wants to.  And you know, I wouldn't have it any other way.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe all Onstad needs to do differently is to manage our expectations better.  Maybe he needs to have a solid classic achewood arc that updates... however often he can update it... Even if it's once a month... as long as it's segregated from the 'sharper image' pun strips... then we could let these two distinct products of Onstad's exist, without being so unhappy with the one for not being the other... right?  At most, we could complain that the classic achewood is not updating nearly as often as the nouveau achewood, but, hell, I'll take what I can get, eh.  I'm not paying for it.  And even if I am paying for it, it ain't like the dude is raking in millions.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would guess that as an artist, Onstad might well need to do a certain amount of doodling... part of the creative process right, is that sometimes you kind of have a dull period, right, and to get through that you might need to just keep creating anyway, and you might even need to have an audience to bounce your ideas off of, to keep you in the swing of things.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
So anyway... we haven't heard from Onstad on our concerns, and maybe, hey, we should ask him what's up, what direction this is all going in, and maybe Onstad could manage our expectations better?   <br/>

random thoughts...   <br/>

I'm off to the airport.

      The toilet flush indicator. When you remember you left the iron on and you run to get it but you definitely washed your hands but you're not sure if you flushed but your girlfriend finds it first and never mentions it until far later as ammunition in a petty little argument and... ha hah hah... never happened.

      I wouldn't say that. 'chili-melons' was a rookie breast-man euphemism. 'Massive little man' is a veteran business man euphemism, and it's not a mistake. Ray obviously doesn't feel like it's wrong given how he says it over and over and over and fucking over again. It really saddens me. Ray isn't the kind of person/cat that would do something like this; to say the exact same phrase so many times in every situation. Ray is the kind of cat/person that calls other people/otters just the first thing that comes out of his mouth. Ray should be calling Phillipe something different every time they talk, or at least some other variant on 'little man'. Either Ray is getting more lazy and less creative (makes sense given his ideas in this strip) or Onstad is losing his touch for clever turns-of-phrase (more likely). And honestly, 'massive little man' wasn't clever at all in the first place. It barely makes sense.

      This latest strip in this arc feels formulaic.  Tell me something about Teodor or Ray that I don't already know.  Put them in a new and interesting context.  Today's strip may as well just be [IMGS OFF] as far as my concern goes.    <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is... this is just a terrible comic strip, not just today, but all of them, if this is what it's going to come down to, after all these years, is Phillipe falling for this shit.  It's like the comic strip Blondie where none of the characters ever learn anything for their whole entire lives.  Fuck this!  This is creative?  I can look out any window if and see losers like this.  Hell, I can look in a mirror.

      Honestly, yeah.  I've been trying really hard to stick with it, but I'm out of patience.  This feels exactly like the Williams Sonoma arc but with Philippe swapped in for Connie and with even worse product names.  This arc is probably even going to have the same kind of bullshit ending that the Williams Sonoma one did.

      Maybe Onstad has some kind of OCD, obsessing on the details.. carefully filling out the back story.. The back story becomes the story...  that doesn't work... a set designer can not save a play.  A set designer gives the play context, but there still needs to be a play!  A good play will work regardless of the set.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
with regards to this current arc... compare and contrast this current strip with these early strips: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Achewood ca. 1902  10/09/2001  <br/> 
https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uuafW8sKC <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Humans Show  11/12/2001  <br/> 
https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua7KD2dk <br/> 
 <br/> 
What do you see?  In the early strips, Onstad's characters were bringing a much needed (by us, the readers) refreshingly surreal perspective, lampooning the ridiculousness of our culture. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the present strips, The characters are turning into the worst kinds of humans -- they have BECOME what they were lampooning and critiquing in the earlier strips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is this some kind of performance art by Onstad?  Killing his characters slowly but surely?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Either Onstad needs to try some acid again or whatever it was he was on when he first started, or I need to try some acid, because this just isn't working for me.

      since nobody will chubby you for truth because you are you, i will. you do realize that this is not performance art, but the arc of onstad's life? the becoming of that which he parodies, slowly and surely fading into mediocrity.. whether he's aware of it or not, chris has become the at-home pansy-man he previously scorned. i always thought him delusional when in an earlier interview or some such he said that he identified himself most closely to ray. <br/>

at per your suggestion, it might be high time for me to fly to cali/portland/wherever the dude is, hallucinogens and narcotics in tow, and show the man what it's like to be young and reckless again. i will, however, have to procure a wig.

      Srsly. I don't know why he even bothers drawing the characters anymore, since it's pretty clear that the main focus of these strips is crapping out as many "funny" (not) catalog items as possible. What really gets me is that Onstad either doesn't understand that this kind of parody is only funny to those who are intimately familiar with the source material (that is, those who actually indulge in this kind of vapid upscale consumerism on a regular basis), or worse yet, thinks that his readers are composed of the same kind of neutered housebroken middle-aged product enthusiasts of which he is an exemplar. Seriously weak sauce. Just start a blog already and spare us this forced butchering of our favorite characters into shallow one-dimensional mouthpieces for your repetitive game of pretentious word salad.

      I of all people can't speak for achilleselbow but maybe I do have something of a track on his personality;  The fact that he got riled up about me all those years ago indicates maybe that we have more in common than not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think that achilleselbow's above comment is meant in a malicious way.  Ironically, achilleselbow himself is a prodigious generator of 'word salad.'  Combine this tendency of his with his youthful cynicism and sardonic wit, and there you go.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah, achilleselbow is pretty critical in a not-too-nice take-no-prisoners way in a lot of his writing, but hey, partly that comes from a youthful attitude of being unwilling to compromise his ideals.  Some people would say at this point 'but with age he'll learn that life is more nuanced than black and white, and his perspective will become more conservative,' but of course, that's bullshit.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's good that achilleselbow comes across as almost pissed off at times and irate;  I'm of the opinion that if you're not irate about the state of the world then you're not paying attention.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe most of achilleselbow's experience has been with the somewhat artificial and contrived environment of higher education institutions and overall both he and those he associates with are to some significant degree touched by the crazy cheap-plastic-disposable-crap environment that arises from this mish-mash of regulatory and economic dynamics that we have in this country, but hopefully, as he gets older he'll reach out to a wider variety of experience, (hey, I'd recommend volunteering with an NGO, hopefully one aligned with the sort of critical vision of Dambisa Moyo...) and hopefully as achilleselbow gets out in the real world, rather than mellowing out, he'll direct his rage and energy at it, for the purpose of change and destruction...  There seem to be generally two kinds of phenomena in our world... those which need to be changed, and those which need to be destroyed... Like I said, if you aren't on board with this, then you aren't paying attention. <br/> <br/> <br/>

      well no.. probably not terrible.  I'm being flamboyant when I say that.  It still has redeeming qualities, and it might well work for some people, but it's losing me.  For me personally, it's becoming terrible.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's becoming a thing that has absolutely no possibility of universal appeal.  All the possible interest in a strip like today's stems from knowing the characters, and caring about them as if they were people.  It's like a very special episode of Rosanne that only has significant meaning if you really followed the character development all season, and if you bought the character development. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad seems to be making the mistake of overestimating how much his readers are able to perceive the character development that may in his mind be so real.  I remember some interview where Onstad explained that the blogs were great because it allowed him to really expand on and develop the characters in a way that wasn't possible within the confines of the strip... yet... it seems like today the strips have become the blogs...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In a sitcom or a comic strip, I don't think you can achieve as good of a character development as you can in a blog, or a novel.  Charles Dickens' characters... the reader invested feeling and empathy into them...  But Ray?  No...  He was cute at first... It was funny...  Airwolf... yeah okay...  But deep down, Ray is vapid, and not in a good or clever or funny way.  See Ray's character can be funny, but only in a Forrest Gump sort of way... only in so far as we vicariously ride along with him in Airwolf... The vapidity is okay as long as it's a foil for greater adventure, for incongruity.  But it's gotten to a point where Ray's character is represented mainly by this vapidity, with nothing else going on, as in for example the last panel of this strip, and at that point yes, it's formulaic and boring.  Ray's character needs to interact with something more interesting or something... Instead we have Ray's predictable formulaic character interacting with Phillipe's predictable formulaic character.  There's no challenge in that, there's no uncertainty, there's no plot!  Onstad has demonstrated some brilliant potential, but now it's like his awesome characters are like.. it's as if Ray and RB are Ahab and Ishmael, all wandering about the seas without Moby Dick being written into the story, without any plot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would imagine that if Achewood continues in this direction, the fan base will become increasingly populated by people who are readily pleased by facile premise and formula.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
When Achewood started, the strips could each stand on their own, and so could the arcs as well, and they were clever and witty and sardonic and creative.  This is what I mean by having universal appeal... At least to those who have that kind of sense of humor, it's funny, in the same way that those who 'get' slapstick humor will universally appreciate Charlie Chaplin's performances. <br/> 
 <br/> 
there you go.  my thoughts on that.  disclaimer:  I haven't done much of anything creative in my life.

      I guess this is all pretty astute.  For the record, the term Flanderization has been coined by some people somewhere and popularized by others (notably TV Tropes) to describe when a character becomes the personification of one element of their character.  It does appear to be happening here...BUT.  You can't just flip that on its ear and say "It's not confusing, it's character development."  There needs to be a reason why Ray goes from vapid, good natured rich cat to, I don't know, the Achewoodian Hamlet, making Beef look like Philippe.  And that's tough.  It's easy to read the entire archive and see it as the process of as long as it took to read and not literally seven and a half years of development, but that's obviously not where the characters came from.  They'll either develop into something else soon, or Chris will call it quits because he has enough sense to know when to Watterson.

      I agree with you that Achewood is getting less accessible, and that that's not a good thing, but I have to agree with what nice-on-water says above vis-a-vis character consistency. You could fairly condemn the comic for being formulaic, but it seems unfair to accuse the characters of this for being consistent. <br/>

      sweet.  But now I see how hard that is.  mawk totally set that up.  I would have to study hard if I was going to do that on purpose.  And even if I did get good at it, what's the point in having TWO dinosaur comics.  I would just be a rip off.  Sometimes I wonder if I could ever produce some body of work derived from my own quirky personality and sense of humor and intellect, and have this work be popular, and always I doubt myself.

      Love is a process, subject to normal variation, and also special cause variation... <br/> 
 <br/> 
There%u2019s two common averages and without some form of range or variance error they are useless. Two averages can be the same, but hide massive differences in behavior. Without a standard deviation it%u2019s not possible to figure out if the two might even be close.  Badly behaving processes tend to not fit their supposed distribution.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you give an average without standard deviations then you%u2019re totally missing the entire point of even trying to measure something. A major goal of measurement is to develop a succinct and accurate picture of what%u2019s going on, but if you don%u2019t find out the standard deviation and do at least a couple graphs then you%u2019re screwed. Just give up man. Game over. Game over.

This might be weird to go into but I have had a  <em>totally platonic and normal</em>  friendship with someone I met on a forum and continue to talk to online for about two years now.  I find admitting that just a bit weird, regardless that I'm on a forum right now, basically, and am Facebook friends with several regulars from here.

      At each stop one guy told us a new chapter from the story of purim, and that's about it.  It got more and more amusing as the night went on.  And we danced Hava Nagila on the train, probably to the dismay of the random Glaswegians on the train.  No stabbings, surprisingly.

      hey everyone let's start an assetbar swingers club <br/> 
 <br/> 
also, for you guys on here, let's experiment with anal sex.  If you're worried that you're not into gay stuff, don't worry -- by definition I don't think that a couple of straight guys poking each other can qualify as gay.  Especially if a heavy duty 1.5 mm thick rubber glove is adapted for use as a condom.  Ya know.. that will kind of make it less intimate... I think it's the intimacy of the whole concept that might bother some people.  You could even use a hole in wall too for extra distance.  Combine the rubber glove condom with tons of lube and I think it will be fairly straight forward.  no pun intended.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for you women on here, you can fuck each other if you like, but everyone knows that women are genetically 50% lesbian anyway, so, lezzing out ain't going to impress no one.

Basically, if I was pretending to be disgraced Tory MP and talking head Neil Hamilton, and I was having sex with a man pretending to be Granville from Open All Hours, then I could imagine that working for me. Also, I would have to be pretty drunk. Get back to me about this. I'm not sure where I stand on this one yet.

      OK, I'll toss in my $0.02.  Chris is a huge Woodehouse fan.  I think he could approach the master's level, but he really needs to take a break from the comic medium and just write.  Write the dang funny story and toss in the drawings for spice.  It's easy to say that, but very, very difficult to do.  One big problem is that society has changed so much since P. G.'s day.  There just aren't the humorously pretentious types around like there were then.  Those types were the mainstays of Woodehouse's comic technique.  Pretentious, sure, but drably and stupidly so.  Sure, you can lampoon them, and it'll get a chuckle or two, but gut-bustlingly funny?  Nah.  So, I sympathize.  The man has the talent, but what to say, what to say? <br/>
