      I know several people that do this. Some pay for it, but three of them will steal it. Every damned time they're out shopping. They're pretty well off too. Not precisely as rich as Ray, but definitely mansion, pool, nice cars and all that. <br/> 
I wonder if they're wealthy in spite of or because of that attitude.

      When I was younger my mom brought me to the grocery store to get some ice cream.  I walked into the store, lost in daydreams, grabbed the ice cream, and walked back to the car.  Mom said, "That was fast!  What'd you do%u2014steal it?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
My face blanched as I realized I  <em>had</em>  stolen it, and I ran back into the store, trying to carry it as subtly as I could, and threaded my way around the aisles so that when I approached the checkout it looked as if I had come from the ice cream area and not the front door, and  then paid for the ice cream. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In retrospect I should've just said, "Oh, yes.  Yes, I guess I did.  Oh well."

      I did something similar once when I was about...oh, ten, maybe. I was at the mall with my mom and her friends and I went into B. Dalton Booksellers (remember when they were a thing?). While there, I found a book I wanted ( <em>Bruce Coville's Book of Nightmares</em> ) and decided to see if my mom would lend me the money to buy it, so I carried it out of the store to go show it to her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My mom said, "They let you take that out of the store?" and I experienced a sinking feeling in my gut as I realized I had basically stolen the book. I surreptitiously carried it back into the store.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do not remember whether my mom bought it for me or not.

      I once walked out of a Laura Secord or some ice cream shop that is much to expensive. After a while, I realized that the woman at the cash didn't give my change, and I was positive I gave her like a twenty. So I started going back after leaving like ten minutes earlier, getrting all huffed and thinking "Bitch trying to steal my money." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I got back and she yelled at me for walking out without paying for my ice cream. I payed and walked away, in shame.

      Yeah, and don't even TRY using a fake ID in one of those bad boys. They run the numbers. (However, as a plus, stuff is fairly cheap because of the power PA has to negotiate deals statewide. Doesn't make up for the closed-at-night-and-on-weekends, though.)

      Nah, the state stores here are more expensive because it's a monopoly. Boone's Farm wine in PA cost me over $4.00, the same bottle in Illinois cost almost a dollar less.  <br/> 
Yes, yes, I know - $4.00 wine - sometimes you just have to splurge a little on yourself and go for the Boone's Farm, instead of the usual $3.50 Thunderbird. I'm such a wine snob.

      Wow, that sounds a lot like Utah, except that we can't buy kegs at all. Plus we can only get beer that's 3.2% ABW (4% ABV) in the grocery stores, real beer is purchased from the liquor stores at disgusting markups--a 12 oz. bottle of Newcastle is $2.15, for example. At least we can get 30-packs of our shitty watered-down beer.

      When I was a kid, my sibs and I ate chips before my mom bought them whenever we went to Market Basket.  Never got in trouble.  WE just hand the cashier the empt bag and she'd charge us for it and throw it away.  Also I loved doing cream shots (the supermarket offered free coffee with the little creamers and me and my sister used to take them like shots).

      I just can't get my wife to get achewood, she hasn't got the other ones I've shown her. I figured this was a good introductory strip, you don't have to know the characters for it to be funny, but it tells you a lot about them. Alas, she said she doesn't get it. "Yaaaay!" whats not to get?

      I wonder if you could eat everything before leaving the store, then take the boxes to the cashier, pay, and go back home.

      Only one to find out; eat thirty hits of acid and submerge yourself in Flambeau Lake for four days. <br/>

It is the only way.
