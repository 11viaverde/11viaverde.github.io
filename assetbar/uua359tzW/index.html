      wow, I ah, uh, ah. uhhhhh.  no itcan't be fanfction per se can it?  I do note that Dr. M has extended the number of times the refrain/picture repeats at the end.  He must simply admire eminem's fine work, as do I.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
the style of this post is Dr. M, both in copy/pasting the work, which is it's self a sort of repeat, and in repeating the refrain at the end numerous times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dr. M is brilliant... he repeats something, and in so doing, he gives it some new meaning.  He expresses himself through the expression of others. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wonder what achilleselbow fan fic would be like.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
probably like diareah. <br/>

Manflesh is on the bleeding edge of it, the place he feels most at home.

      Manflesh has posted a considerable amount of material that has had me brushin my teeth with a toothpaste called Laughter but there were also plenty of dour-lookin cavities hiding amongst them. If he is indeed outing himself as alreadyinuse then it simply means a poster who was capable of being a moist clit often chose to be a pus-filled genital wart makin you wanna scratch-scratch till it turns red and then your lady don't want to let you wear her panties no more. It also shows that all our attempts to guess who alreadyinuse "really was" through close reading and literary analysis were as fruitless as Harold Bloom's ballsack All goin to alreadyinuse "Ain't no way you be one of the good posters on here muhhhfucka You be splashin so much piss on here Ain't no way you can make apple juice" but you see the ability to shapeshift into various writing styles is one of the superpowers given to you when you get bitten by the radioactive chameleon called the Internet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But if there is anything that my man Jack Chick has taught us it is that anyone who is trafficking in the soft bigotry of low expectations can eventually see the light and move on up to the throbbing chauvinism of moral absolutism. There is no more need for the cultural relativism fostered by multiple accounts if you just put every ounce of your love, honor, and Japanese sunlight into the One Account and speak unironically of truth I mean Kurt Vonnegut bein one of the postmodern writers in the main basically believed irony is unnecessary to your voice I mean if there is anyone we can take at his word it is he. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So this is the crowning of the dawn in your born again vaginal rejuvenation surgery, dr_manflesh. You ain't need to jack off into Charybdis, for your soul is getting a hard-on from the stars. <br/>

Choose life, dr_manflesh.  <em>Choose life.</em>

      This is truly a significant day in Assetbar history.  Dr. Manflesh, the world's most loved troll, posts a scathing attack which had been previously posted by one of the most hated trolls in the world: alreadyinuse. What does this mean?  Stayed tuned to CNN. <br/>

      i don't follow this thing real close lately, i wasn't even aware AIU had posted that picture before, or that song or whatever he had posted before, and all i know of manflesh is several of his posts here and the few times i chatted with him around three in the morning on #achewood, and i am aware of how much of a run-on this is (but i don't care because you will get my point just fine hopefully), but the impression I always got from manflesh was that he didn't take this whole assetbar thing very seriously and he thought it was stupid/silly to do so - i could be wrong, i could be projecting my own beliefs on him, i just do not know. but, if i am correct and that is the case, him reposting that picture which goes after most of the 'popular' people here on assetbar who seem to take it so serious sometimes that you would think it's the center of their lives, it is not a completely confusing thing for him to be doing. I hope that makes as much sense as it does in my head, but I am on a bunch of awesome pain medication for a recent surgery, so who the fuck knows.

      My point there I  <em>guess</em>  was that I think he just doesn't care. I don't think he's AIU, I think he just thought it would be funny just like the dick pictures and the graphic fanfics.

      Whoa.  I am blown away by the bleach-soaked brilliance of your post there, False.  It hearkens back to an earlier time of taking on the idiosyncracies of strip characters (dare I say "old school"?  I dare not, though it no less  <em>is.</em> ), but this time, I could be bothered reading it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And in so doing, I lament my previous lack of reading fortitude; all the times I skipped past your post due to the lack of punctuation, all these times, now lost. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The situation of Assetbar today, no matter how frivolous and fleeting it may, no matter how fragile the fingerings of fate, floating on the flotsam and jetsam of happenstance and chaos-theory whimsy - no matter all this, it feels a deep time in Assetbaria.  A time, not of change so much, as it is a time of  <em>natural progression.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Many are going back to their roots, yet with a new understanding of things - pushing the envelopes they were afraid to, knowing a little better the workings of the cogs of situation and socially intellectual competition. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like this time.  It is here.  It is Now.

      it seems that to run through assetbaria screaming "Dr.M and AIU are not the same person" is probably a pretty pointless exercise.  I don't think Dr. M cares if a few people think one way or the other.  Dr. M (who does actually have a PHD, by the way) is, not unlike our good friend AIU (who doesn't have a PHD) more than a little misunderstood by the average joe schmoe.  I don't mean this in a condescending way, I just mean this objectively, as fact, without any pride and prejudice attached.  I don't believe that everyone is remarkable in their own special way.  It's not statistically likely.  Several billion people in the world would require several billion unique ways in to be special so that every last individual could be special and remarkable.  There is a lot of cultural diversity and such out there, giving a lot of different contexts which in turn supports a lot of possible ways to be unique, but there is not enough diversity of context out there to support several billion unique ways for people to be unique. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So anyway, Dr. M is misunderstood, and AIU is misunderstood, and both are remarkable people in both different and also similar ways.   Most of y'all ain't gonna get one nor the other.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And that saddens me.  But I guess that's life, ain't it...   With some kinds of remarkable properties of abstract vision and reasoning, to truly get the reasoning and vantage point is to truly share it, and to therefore be truly remarkable one's self.  See the above postulate as to why it's simply statistically unlikely for everyone to be remarkable in this way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And certainly, that is the fucking definition of remarkable... that which is different from the rest.  Than the rest?  Then the rest?  Whatever.  (gr?)  Hey, how about this:   <em>of the rest</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some people hold a grudge longer than others, due to personality and also differences in biological function of the brain.  Some people have been offended by AIU in this way or that, and AIU has been offended by some people on here.  To think that AIU holds a grudge is pretty presumptious, however.  To think that AIU makes offensive posts mostly or exclusively out of some grudge that he holds is also quite an unsupported assumption.  I mean, shit, look at AIU posting an edited picture of tekende and bixschmix.  That's some pretty offensive shit, when you go reposting images of someone's gf/bf.  And the normal reaction to that would be to be offended.  Hell, AIU was offended when achilleselbow re-used AIU's original hand-face avitar in a copy-cat account.  But AIU recognized his own feeling of offense as natural, but also pretty silly, and shrugged it off immediately.  Anyway, my point is, yes, it's natural and normal to be offended by such shit, and moreover, whenever someone posts such offensive shit, it's normally because that person is intending to be offensive, and because that person IS a complete heel, or asshole, or moron, in that given context.  We have all been assholes to people in a given context at some point in our lives.  There is my ex-gf who told me the story of the time she went out on a date with this guy, led him on, and then ditched him at a club to go home with some other guy and screw him.  She wasn't proud of it; the guy she ditched felt bad, ya da ya da.  She was kind of a cunt in this context.  Or like the time I raped and murdered that entire Mormon family whose car had broken down.  I was having a bad day, and I to my credit I did actually initially mistake them for Jehovah's Witnesses.  But hey, most of us hopefully get wiser and grow inside from such experiences and learn to become more sensitive to the needs and wants of others.  Some of us don't.  Like that creep named Bill at my last tech support job who got fired for using the e-mail system of one of the stores we were supporting to hit on one of the employees whom he had never met, in a different state.  Creeeeppy.  And he kept hitting on my one co-worker who was half his age, even after she clearly told him to shove off.  Bill was one of those guys whose entire demeanor screamed PERVERT!  And he was. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So what I am saying is, hey, AIU is performance art.  It's like telling a sick joke, or making a twisted exclamation, like threatening to run someone over, or joking about the possibility of getting run over by a bus...  I mean... if you don't joke about death in some form or other at some time or other in your life, then you are pretty damn unique and unusual in that respect... AIU is that dark and twisted and demented and silly and crazy and high-on-drugs and high-on-mental-dysfunction and selfish and condescending and generally revolting side of human behavior, all wrapped up into one, and made as real as possible in the context of a messageboard.  Can AIU really be real?  Too many, he is very real.  (He put that typo ( <em>too</em> ) in there just to piss you off.)    But I mean, if you look at AIU with the irony in mind with which his shit is intended, then you aren't offended, but you are perhaps amused.  Or even bored some of the time.  But if you see the irony, then you probably also have the capacity to see the humor.  I will grant you that it's a pretty real sort of performance art, and it is perhaps serious and not ironic, in that it does not make an attempt to fully identify it's self as ironic, and the artist knows that many will take it seriously and literally, and be offended by it on many levels (typos being just one of them.)  The artist is pushing the bounds of how far he can ethically go, knowing that he's going to piss people off, and the artist is balancing this with his ethical right and indeed obligation to put irony out there, to put creative witty irony out there, to push against the closed doors of people's minds.  The artist isn't nailing a manefesto to the door so much as dropping a charge of C-$ (another deliberate typo) at the door.  Yes, this art and comedy is pretty irrelevent without the pissed off audience.  The battering ram is of no use without the locked door.  But it is what it is.  And underneath it all, the relentless artist, the pissed off audience, are real people, and you know, hey, it'd be nice if we all got along, as real people, on some level, in some place, at some time.  It'd be nice.  But I tell ya what, it's a bitch of a world out there.  It's a real bitch.  And you know, even if you all get along with me, there's a billion other trolls out there, waiting to be disliked by you.  I think that everyone should have at least one troll that they can't conveniently change the channel on, you know.  I think that's healthy, to have that every now and then.  To have a troll who won't go away, who forces something in your face that you don't want.  If you don't want something, if you dislike something, it could just be that maybe it is something you need to think about... and yeah, we all need to think about hate... we need to explore it...  with humor, and with seriousness.  Hate and jealously and bitterness.  It won't do you know good.  (typo) <br/>

      Friday night I`m going nowhere <br/> 
All the lights are changing green to red <br/> 
Turning over TV stations <br/> 
Situations running through my head <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well looking back through time <br/> 
You know it`s clear that I`ve been blind <br/> 
I`ve been a fool <br/> 
To ever open up my heart <br/> 
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule <br/> 
 <br/> 
Saturday I`m running wild <br/> 
And all the lights are changing red to green <br/> 
Moving through the crowd I`m pushing <br/> 
Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream <br/> 
 <br/> 
Only wish that you were here <br/> 
You know I`m seeing it so clear <br/> 
I`ve been afraid <br/> 
To tell you how I really feel <br/> 
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I`ve made <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you want it <br/> 
Come and get it <br/> 
Crying out loud <br/> 
The love that I was <br/> 
Giving you was <br/> 
Never in doubt <br/> 
Let go your heart <br/> 
Let go your head <br/> 
And feel it now <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sunday all the lights of London <br/> 
Shining , Sky is fading red to blue <br/> 
I`m kicking through the Autumn leaves <br/> 
And wondering where it is you might be going to <br/> 
 <br/> 
Turning back for home <br/> 
You know I`m feeling so alone <br/> 
I can`t believe <br/> 
Climbing on the stair <br/> 
I turn around to see you smiling there <br/> 
In front of me <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you want it <br/> 
Come and get it <br/> 
Crying out loud <br/> 
The love that I was <br/> 
Giving you was <br/> 
Never in doubt <br/> 
 <br/> 
And feel it now <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let go your heart <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let go your head <br/> 
 <br/> 
And feel it now <br/>

      I'd like to think that thanks to people like Chick, we're almost ensured further generations of rock-a-holics.  Right now in the mid-west, a thirteen year-old "good kid" who'd never given much thought to his family's churchgoing is ripping up the Chick tract his grandmother tucked into his birthday card.  There's been an injustice at school, or perhaps he's disgusted by the atrocities that march into his house like clockwork via the news (hey, I can dream).  "God is bullshit,  <em>man</em> ," our little guy thinks.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
He comes up with a thousand and one arguments against the existence of God, many of which are exceptionally flimsy, but all of them are well above the level of intellectual rigor he finds in grandmother's little helpers.  He starts listening to Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir.  Not the most sophisticated stuff, but he'll work his way up the food chain later, his forays culminating in a Grade 11 road trip to see Maiden in St. Paul.  It's a brave new world of nail polish, hot-knifing and pretending to read Nietzsche for Jimmy Irvine of Marshfield, Wisconsin, and he owes it all to the delusions and rank hypocrisy of Jack Chick.

      I don't think Jack Chick has ever covered the topic of Hippo Urination...or Porcupine Houses. I'm thinking that at best Phillipe will become a hardcore Christian Fundamentalist who, for reasons unbeknown to anyone else, feels equally strong about Hippo Pee and Porcupine Houses (but if the boy in the Metallica story is the protagonist, that shouldn't come into too much conflict with the Jack Chick ideology).

      My favourite bits are when he explains the hierarchy of demons, and how this relates DIRECTLY to the Catholic Church. <br/> 
 <br/> 
...because, you know, the hierarchy of demons is in the Bible too, you know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(it is not) <br/> <br/> <br/> Speaking of which, demonology came up in conversation with a friend the other day, when he looked up the X-men character  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224024152/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_(Marvel_Comics)">Legion</a>  - a mutant with multiple personality, each personality manifesting a different mutant power (interestingly appearing a few years before Doom Patrol's  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224024152/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Jane">Crazy Jane</a>  - whom I explained got his name from the New Testament Biblical demonised individual who referred to himself as "Legion - for there are many of us".  Creepy. <br/> 
Anyway, so he was about to click on the page for the demonological facts about the demon "Legion", when I suggested against it because it's a Wiki page on demonolgy, and that's just a bit too much of a headfuck sometimes.* <br/> 
 <br/> 
Which it is, and he was thankful for my advice, as he'd had a long day and couldn't handle such shit. <br/> <br/> <br/> *Or most or all times, depending on your taste.

      To his credit, he picked up quite intuitively that violence is pretty damn funny.  And cool! <br/>

I also like the irony that his avatar is a depiction of real life horror and the aftermath of genuine violence.  I dare say the irony is deliberate, and I appreciate it as a result.

      When I was nine I found one in the bathroom at our local basketball gym during my brother's gym. It was about satan-worshiping, and the dangers of getting you and your buddies together and summoning demons. I was terribly disappointed when it did not show me exactly how they summoned these demons, or which each of these demons did. It also did not show me how to make my own fireworks.

      I find it makes them taste rather slimy and unpalatable. Nothing ruins a meal more than sin being added to my meal. However, I tend to prefer sin in just about every other possible context. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The greatest problem, however, is not believing in sin. I wish to engage in it, yet I do not know what it is and must instead act on clues from others. I sometimes wonder whether this itself is considered sinful, but no, unfortunately, it probably is not.

      Don't go tryin' to cast out demons then, in that case. <br/>

I love the censorship modern Bibles have. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Naked and bleeding" basically equals "violently sodomised" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also remember hearing that the word translated as "filth" in a section of one of the major prophets, would be more accurately translated as "shit".  Not "faeces",  <em>"shit."</em>   It was the coarse word for it.  The guys who did Old King James probably would have translated that directly as  <em>shit</em>  nowadays, but they fucked up a lot of other stuff like adding in unicorns and thinking that translating the English version from the German version is just as good as translating it directly from the original Ancient Greek/Hebrew/Aramaic (like they do with translations these days). <br/> 
 <br/> 
*Note: yes, I realise the Torah is in Ancient Hebrew and not Aramaic - all except half of Daniel, which for some reason breaks into Aramaic once the Babylonian priests start wailing about the king's commands, and then keeps it up until, I think, when Daniel starts to prophesy about the end of the world.  Somewhere around there it cuts into Hebrew again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>There may be a legitimate reason for why they did this, and if anyone knows or can ask their Rabbi/Priest/Minister/Lecturer/Witch Doctor, I'd be really interested to find out.</strong>

      I think my favorite part about it is the unintended message that playing D&D and joining the occult will actually enable you to cast real spells rather than just making you fat.

That's not gonna mess him up for life!  Especially if he does it every day and starts to enjoy it when he reaches puberty and starts having sexual feelings attached to the butchering of prostitutes!

      Why won't we see our friends? Is it because hell is too dark (as alluded to)? Is it poorly designed? Is it just plain hard to get around with inadequate public transit and the inability to park anywhere? Actually, now that I think about it I think I'm just describing San Francisco, which is most definitely not hell. A fact that can be obviously proven because although it does not freeze over it is astoundingly cold even during summer months. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps hell is simply like being assigned to a lunch schedule when all of your friends were assigned to another one so you have to be sorta friends with people you don't really ever see outside of lunch. Man, hell must be very socially awkward.

      I think its just that its not a punk kinda party. It's at a community center built in the 70's with beige walls and some of those murals of smiling multicultural groups painted in much the same style as math book illustrations. You come in and theres some watered down grape aide and a mix tape of Enya and kids bop songs is on. a broadly smiling women in a pants suit with a brightly colored vest with kitten pins all over it tells you that the craft room has all the cotton balls and construction paper you need and that the bean bag toss and the basketball court are open to use as long as you want, because its a lock in...forever.

      Au contraire; there's plenty of hate on the internets.  Indeed, if hate was money, the internets would be something akin to Weimar Germany in the 1920s.  It's just that the hate is so often misdirected.

      Well, Chick's goal is clearly to change the way society works - less gays, less premarital sex, more bible education in schools, etc etc.  To me, that's political.

      What I find amusing about Chick is that his biblical literalism makes him utterly unable to distinguish between different grades of sin and probably weakens his message.  He shows people who have sex before marriage in exactly the same boat, eg getting tortured by demons, as those who rape children.  I would suspect that many fairly conservative christians who would otherwise be sympathetic to his ideas and even disapprove of fairly innocuous things like pre-marital sex would shy away from the idea that consensual adultery is as bad as child rape.

      The thing about Christianity is that it doesn't really differentiate. I mean, sure, you hear about these different circles of hell, but when it comes down to it, it's all eternal damnation. Whether you're kiddy fiddlin' or just considering the possibility of a universe without a personal god.

      Unfortunately, you have fallen into the same trap.  You say Christianity is always black and white with no shades of gray, yet you have put all Christians together in their beliefs.  Many Christians have no problem differentiating things, and I would even go so far as to say certain Christian sects are able to differentiate. <br/> 
Not that I fall in that Christian category, just thought I should point out that if you are advocating the concept of 'seeing grey areas,' then you should see grey areas in everything.  Which in itself is a black and white belief.  So is it just Christianity that is black and white?  Look at all the forces in your life and thought and tell me, can we actually escape duality?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, and the other fascinating thing, I always love seeing how many concepts from other sources than the Bible make it into Christian belief or discussion of Christian belief.  In this case, I mean the circles of Hell, which are not from the Bible, but from Dante. <br/>

      Well, arguably the orthodox position of the western church is that there are not different levels of sins. You are either in a state of complete sin, working to get away from sin to grace, or in a state of grace. The differences between rape and pre-marital sex are more in how they relate to your attitudes towards your fellow man etc.

      I know.  And it has been working for me too.  I just find it annoying that you can't just paste the link without adding those tags, and that you can't edit or delete posts you messed up on.  So I blame assetbar.

      I'm sure we've all had this conversation a number of times.  I wrote (read: plagiarised the bulk of it from someone else on the internet and twisted it to the contextual means) a great story about it, but I'll be damned if I can find it in the 1000  posts I seem to have made (which surprised the hell out of me when I saw that figure). <br/>

And, of course, as a wise poster here once famously said -  <br/>

      True, but in response to complaints of too much hating I'm going to balance this out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Near my home town in rock springs theres a deli, and the dude who runs it is this guy named Gregory. He doesn't have them on the menu but if you ask him for a hamburger go "one hamburgurs samowich" slapping the counter for emphasis. Then he makes you this hamburger that is on the best bread with the tastiest freshest ingredients on any hamburger ever. And he charges you like $2. And when you leave hes all like "thank you for being customer!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I tell you this because i estimate that this guy is as awesome as jack chick sucks.

      Onstad has his engineers working on me?   <br/>

feh...  you can't IP block me... I can get fresh IPs from a variety of sources, such as my ISP, AND my web host.  I can also use drone PCs all over the world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
you'll have to get more creative than that.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I dunno what's available in the way of identity verification.  Maybe something involving a credit card or bank account...  Most people don't have an unlimited supply of those.  But what the fuck... you gonna require people to type in a credit card number just to get their ID verified? <br/> 
 <br/> 
You could limit new accounts to posting once per day until the account is so many days old, instead of until the account has run a script to view X number of strips.  But even there, all a person has to do is plan the trolling in advance, registering new accounts in advance of when they're needed. <br/>

i don't make fun of homeless people though 'cos i was basically one of them when i first joined the Assetbarrio. the only difference was that i had a car. not that i drove much. gas is expensive!! <br/>

oh wait. you're not talking to me. but if you call him elephant poo..and they poo so big...he's a bigger man than you are, you old female, eh? <br/>

also, enemployment is a funny typo. it's like saying you work for some sort of anti-team. <br/>

      i was invited to a friend's christmas madrigal at his church a couple of years ago.  i'm not religious, but my friend recently got back into his church pretty hard.  he had the lead in the little play, so some of us went to show support of him.  his church is a baptist church in the southern tradition. on one wall of the entry hall is a floor to ceiling display of all of the jack chick tracts.  his church was creepy as hell but we did score all kinds of crazy religious propaganda.

      The southern baptist church by my high school used to have Super Bowl parties, offering free pizza and soda.  Then, at half time, they'd turn off the game, lock the doors, and try to make you "confess and convert."  They wouldn't turn the game back on.  Still, free pizza.

      My favorite part about this strip is its fleshing out of the Achewood world, the "Acheworld"(TM), if you will.  Phillipe is still five, and his mother has sent him to this home like it's some freakish boarding house.  This is most likely a one-off, but what a neat story arc it might make!

      You're so right, what is the deal with Cracker Barrel and Fundamentalists?  What is it about cheesy, starchy, olden timey foods that attracts them so? <br/>

Do they think that by eating such things as dumplings and pressed chicken they might somehow gain the powers of their Dark Ages brethren?

      You are confusing correlation with causation.  Cracker Barrel has Southern-type dishes, and that's where many fundamentalists also live.  Just 'cause I like to eat some catfish and pecan pie does not make me a fundamentalist. <br/>

      I didn't see one until high school.  On the ground, out by the picnic tables.  I don't recall which tract it was, but I do remember being so blown away by the ludicrousness of it that I was pretty convinced it had to be a joke.  Not until college did I learn that Jack Chick is indeed very real.  Too real.

      Dammit guys, I see only a red X here. Usually I wouldn't mind, but the cascade of bandwagon replies piqued my curiosity, and now I can't die happy until I know what it was. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To contribute, I believe  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224024152/https://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0094/0094_01.asp">this</a>  is arguably Chick's most batshit creation, though there's a lot of competition, especially from that new vampire one that just plain baffles me.

      YES I wasn't sure if anyone outside of DC public schools knew about that. There is a facebook group about it but I think it is only on my high school network.

      If Mr. Onstad makes these tracts available for purchase I will throw every damn penny I have at him. The original tracts scarred my fragile 9-year-old psyche, as is their goal. I'd love to see what Teodor's tracts would do if I (like many folks did back when I worked in fast food) handed them off as "tips" at the drive-thru window.
