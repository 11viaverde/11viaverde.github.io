      I read it in a week for a American lit class in college. People told me that the reason I didn't enjoy it was that I rushed through it for the necessary reason described above, even though they were only saying this because they really liked the Professor and were convinced that his ramblings gave his class character, and had not read the book. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But for me, the story went like this: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Hey what's up. I'm a dude named Augie March. I don't know what I want out of life but I get lots of cool experiences mainly because I am handsome. Apparently, I'm Jewish because the guy who wrote my book is Jewish, even though that never comes up anywhere in the freaking book. If you need the kind of Judaism that is  <em>spelled out for you</em> , read Malamud. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"There's a bunch of interesting characters, but I can't really spend time with them. You're stuck with me and my bland descriptions of my interactions with them. Anyone of them could be a much more interesting narrator for a novel but I'm more important because I cover so much ground. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Check it. I totally bone a bunch of boring, overly submissive female characters but it's important because it's the fifties and I guess this has never happened in a novel before. I don't know I didn't really look. There's a few interesting women like the chick who has a baby out of wedlock by some other dude and I help take care of her but I got 200 more pages to fill and I can't be held down  <em>with a plot</em>  so I got rid of her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I think I stole books for a while. It makes me a  <em>rebel</em>  but with a dash of likeable  <em>hipsterism</em> . I will inspire a generation of dudes to wear glasses without frames. And scarves. Lots of scarves. They will think they can get laid this way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I go to Mexico with this other chick and become a falconer, but I suck at it so I go back home to Chicago. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Oh shit World War II started. I guess I want to fight or something. That's what everyone wanted to do during my generation right? My ambivalence which comes more from a lack of describing what I'm thinking than what I am actually thinking makes me  <em>so compelling.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I marry some other random chick. The End." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fuck that guy.

      One time my friend got pretty blazed and drunk and we were standing outside a house and few people came out and started a campfire. My friend began cheering them on by shouting things like "FUCK YEAH! FIRE!" and "BURN THAT SHIT!" and "SET THAT SHIT ON FIRE!" When I told him he was being kind of an ass he turned to them and said, semi-obnoxiously, "Hey, man, sorry for partying," as though to say, "Just because you're not partying means that I have to put my completely great partying on low heat? That is mega bullshit, but whatev, chief." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ever since the phrase "Sorry for partying" has become an arbitrary expression of moral and drunken superiority among my pals. If you do something crazy like shit on a put bill, well, "Sorry for partying," and you are completely in the right. Vomit pants buttons all over a passed out cheerleader at a baby shower? Sorry for partying. Snort a line of organic honey and get three chicks and a dude pregnant? Sorry for partying. Slam some weed in some everclear and pound some hoot juice and wind up freezing up the Jumotron at a Knicks game? Sorry for partying.

      Yeah, I don't want to turn this forum into a bulletin board for my own ventures. But I will. It still feels outrageously weird to talk about it. Like when someone asks what I do for a living I can now say, "I'm a writer," which believe it or not I find terribly embarrassing and awkward, because now I have to talk about something I care very much about, and I lack the social or mental machinery to do that. Maybe I got hella depression.

      Any further updates?? As far as the awkward and embarrassing goes, you could probably reframe it as a enjoyable rush that will in turn sort out your self-confidence. That awkward and embarrassing feeling is the emotion you get from being exposed as something Great. Try and enjoy the rush.

 <br/> 
Another friend of mine that works in a place that sells shacks stuck it on his car before he sold it and the buyer was all "mmmmmmmmmmmmMMMM CLOWNS" before he purchased it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
THEN MY FRIEND GOT MONEY <br/>

      I just got an awesome idea. What if you used spcial ink to get a tattoo - so that it changes colour with temperature! <br/> 
Think of the applications <br/>

Just rub your arm vigorously and the tattoo MYSTEEEERIOUSLY changes!

      No, you make an excellent point.  The ancient Greek alphabet was short and easy to write fast, so they recorded like tons of shit, and maybe it wasn't the best, but it's all we've got.  And since humans haven't changed much physically in 100,000 years, there could have been pre-ice-age civilizations living on the continental shelves that has very advanced, wood-based technologies, including books, but which are now seaweed.   <em>(And yes, I'd like to write about such pre-moderncultures, if only I had the energy.) </em>

Claiming that the only influence of the ancient Greeks on our civilization is the word  --not even the concept--  "democracy" is equally spurious as claiming they had everything to do with how we live.   Dollars to doughnuts the truth lies somewhere in the middle.   After all, metron ariston.

      They went even deeper than that, plumbing the depths of fundamental logic.  Before then the idea of building ideas from basic axioms hadn't been considered, and idea like "A statement must be either true or false, with no in-between" was debatable.

      I think that's a bit strong. You can trace a thread from modern liberal thinking back to Renaissance Humanism, which gained huge intellectual benefit from the rediscovered texts of classical civilization. I can see that ths eschatological view of the past might be reductive, but it's certainly defensible. <br/>

      I think Phillipe is Onstad's allegory into children. At least, that is how I interpereted the strip where Phillipe is crying about not having a chainsaw, and then admonishing Teodor for getting irritated at that, out of some paternal guilt on the author's part, I believe. At any rate, I doubt he will go this route.

      It's bound to happen eventually. Hell, 1400  strips without any of the characters having a baby is probably some kind of record for a webcomic. And Onstad is certainly capable of producing funny comics about sperm counts, birthing pools, breast-feeding and poop.

      Um.  No.  No it's not.  The vast majority of people who get into the humanities are fully aware of how their field does and doesn't correspond to the job market (I can only assume that by "superfluous" you mean "not relevant to a large chunk of qualifications sought after in the general job market").  Some of us, nay, most of us (although I'm not claiming to speak for grayestnova), get into the field because it excites us, gets us up in the morning, and think that working in a field that you love is worth a financial trade-off. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry for taking this personally and going on a tear, I'm just fracking sick to death of all of the "hey, you're qualified to work at Starbucks now" cracks.  We've all heard them before, and I'm perfectly aware of how one's academic choices affect one's life.

When you decide your major, you're all, "Man, I mean... I like computers, but I don't like want to marry them or anything."  And then you see the guys who want to marry their computers, and you feel comfortable in the fact that you've made the better decision for yourself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then you graduate and go "Fuck, man.  Why couldn't I have wanted to marry that computer?" when you're working for as a secretary and Jimmy is flying out to Seattle and defragging a some jigawatts, "No, I had to like "anthropology".  Nobody even fucking knows what that is!  The next person who asks me if I study bugs...  I'll kill them with a rock." <br/>

      As a (sexy) man with multiple degrees in fields that make barrels of money, I'm going to agree with you.  Despite my stack of sheepskin, what I do has little to do with my education.  That is always the way of things.  I regret not knowing more about the humanities.  Oh sure, I can read and understand whatever the hell I want, but having experienced faculty and a culture of knowledge around you is impossible to recreate.  Even if I went back, I couldn't get it.  I recommend the little shithead teenagers on this board to consider getting a liberal arts education, then learning plumbing or some shit, so you will have the money to appreciate the life you now understand. <br/>

Of course, being rich means you can drown your sorrows of a mis-spent youth.  Four hookers at once can make any decision seem like the right one.

      Ideally you would get other people to pay for your degree, aka parents or scholarships. But really, I don't see that much of a difference. Apart from the business/econ majors who start out with a 100k job at some company with two last names working 80 hour weeks around the kind of people that no amount of money is worth interacting with, everyone is pretty much in the same boat after the first four years. My math and science friends work at engineering, laboratory, or consulting jobs for 40-50k, while my humanities friends work in publishing or general office gigs for 35-45k. Not that big a difference, and the most successful one of us was the guy who went to art school and now pulls in over 80k as a freelance animator. If you really care that much about money, a humanities degree is also the best preparation for law school.

      Wait, wait. I know I am a just a liberal arts major, so maybe my logical processes aren't the most developed, but I am having some problems here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Techie degrees are not a waste of money, but liberal arts degrees are? I know you're not implying that everyone should have a math- or science-related career, because that would be nonsensical on a number of levels. Should people who are inclined toward the liberal arts just not go to college, even though that is the most likely place they'd be exposed to math and science classes via graduation requirements? Or should they just teach themselves everything they need to know, the assumption being that they could gain nothing from interacting with people who know enough about literature or languages or whatever to teach at a professorial level or from being motivated to work hard because they are being graded or from talking with other students who could provide different viewpoints and start discussions? Or should liberal arts employers just not require degrees, while techie employers should? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think I am missing something here! I am trying to employ my overpriced reading comprehension skills, and they are  <em>not working</em> .

     After 9 years out in the workforce with an English/Communication major and minors in Creative and Scientific/Technical Writing, I believe that the existence of those jobs is a  <strong>LIE</strong> , perpetuated by the bastards that make up those books and pamphlets on "The jobs you'll be able to readily get with Xxxx Major..." <br/>

     You will get the job you want immediately if you can check 'Yes' for at least one of the following: <br/> 
     [  ]  A family member is president of the company <br/> 
     [  ]  While finishing your degree, you worked 40-plus hours a week at the company of your choice as an unpaid intern to gain the necessary experience. (While also working a second job to pay for tuition and foodstuffs. <br/> 
     [  ]  You are going into the field of creating employment handouts like this. <br/> 
     [  ]  You are willing to work for below minimum wage, whilst doing the work of two full-time employees who both recently quit due to exhaustion. <br/>

      All y'all narrow-minded.  Liberal arts education is supposed to broaden the mind and teach you to think.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I got a degree in a foreign language, worked overseas for few years, came back to the US, and ended up in finance, never having taken any accounting or even math courses in college.  No formal training, just aptitude, willingness to work, ability to think problems through, and  <em>skill at communicating more than one viewpoint</em> .  Now I earn more than my mother and sisters, who are doctors.  (That undoubtedly has to do with my being male rather than anything that actually should matter.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Get your degree in something, be willing to take on more than your current job description, then stick with an employer long enough to get promoted.  Doesn't fucking matter what you started with if you do the goddamned job.

What it comes down to is basically two choices: You could either hate your job, makes lots of money, and live for your vacations, or love your job, be constantly broke, and wake up wanting to go to work. I work Security, just got my EMT, and am going to go Paramedic. I don't get paid squat, but I wake up every morning (erm...night) knowing that what I do is good, and it keeps my heart, the wellspring of life, alive and happy. You may decide that you want to vacation in Europe twice a year. That's your decision. But none of us are factory perfect, and we should all be careful saying any way is better than any other, 'cause we only see things from our own perspective. <br/>

In short: Rock on with whatever decision floats your boat.

      I am not saying everyone should have a science or computer based job, hell, I have a crippling fear of flourescent lighting myself. It is just that you have all the same job opportunities (barring the skim few jobs your education may qualify you for that every other liberal arts major is vying for), so in that instance, why not work instead? Not the best idea in the world, but I cringe every time I hear a graduate 'thinking of maybe taking graphic design'. <br/> 
Post graduate studies open a great variety of jobs available to those who have an idea of what they want out of it, otherwise, they are more than content to pad their wallets with those who don't.

      Of course, the upside of a liberal arts education is that they have way more fun than engineers/engineering students do. I mean, while they're out partying, getting sloshed and having wild orgies (I like to think that this is what liberal arts students do... it makes me glad inside), we're stuck in the computer lab at midnight doing fourier transforms and trying to figure out how to apply a noise filter to the recording we just made of ourselves saying "the green leafy tree provides plenty of shade" so that we can pass our signals and systems class, all while trying to ignore the smell of the pizza soaked in spilled energy drink coming from the next table over, where some guy wearing a Zelda shirt is splitting his time between writing code in C to make pikachu do cartwheels across the screen, reading Gizmodo, and asking people's shoes the occasional question about video games. Then once we get a job, we're  <em>working</em>  for that guy, except now, as part of the wages of sin required to get his engineering degree, he's completely taken leave of his common sense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A perfect example: at work, we had gotten in a deep fat fryer that was on an oil rig when it caught on fire, and were supposed to disassemble it to figure out what had gone wrong. We spent a couple days working on it, figured out why it had burst into flames, then had to put it back together so the customer could take it to court or something. Picture a big box, about two feet high by three feet long, with the short end open on one side, and you've got the idea. Also, envision it completely coated in a fairly thick layer of grease, animal fat, and other detritus. This box was propped up at about a 45 degree angle or so, with the open side up, so that our engineer could see in and reassemble the thing when - oops! - he drops a tiny little fuse or something inside. He spends the next four hours first feeling around blindly for the part, then grabbing a flashlight and dental mirror to probe the inside of the fryer. Needless to say that, before long, this engineer's hands and arms were coated in yummy animal drippings. I clocked in later that day and the project of finding the missing part was foisted upon me. I spent a minute staring blankly at the light and mirror, then did what any reasonable person would do - I tilted the fryer the other direction and let the part fall back out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, my long tangential anecdote aside, an engineering education might be less "superfluous" than a liberal arts education, given that there are a lot of skills learned in an engineering or science degree that nobody in their right mind would want to pick up otherwise. Those folks might even make more money in the workforce, sure, but I think that's really just compensation for having to take engineering classes and work with engineers for the rest of your life. Really, I'm not sure who comes out ahead in that race.

      I will chime in again.  Do both.  Focus on a libarts thing, then learn an applicable skill.  My boss is a former top-end Literary Criticism junkie, professor at Princeton.  He programs computers and tries to make me work, and makes more money than God.  The best path in life involves knowing how to enjoy your existence, and having the means to DO those things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Creative writers should follow the path of Toni Morrison.  Get an MFA.  Become an editor, while honing your own craft.  When you have a solid product, you will have an easy time getting published.  I have two friends that did this (well, not quite at the published part), and they love it.  Enough money to live a good life, and plenty of opportunity to write, and interact with writers.

      Hey, not everyone who majors in the sciences is going to find a job either.  For example, I am a biology major.  Without having some level of postgraduate education, there will be NO jobs for me.  On the other hand, I like biology and I want to take it further.  That doesn't mean I'm wasting money, if I am ultimately happy with my education and job.  So if it's true that liberal arts degrees are a waste of money, it's also true that a bunch of other fields are a waste of money.  In this line of thinking, people should just stick to strictly vocational training, because any job that allows you a level of autonomy is probably going to require years of schooling past the undergrad level.

      I (and most engineers) view pure science as basically libarts.  Hell, at my local school (GO SOONERS) they are often in the same college.  Arts and Sciences.  Where brilliant people go to starve.  Business and Engineering are the big moneymakers, along with a few others in various colleges.  But as that guy up there said, you have to deal with the culture as payment.  Either greasy engineers or slimy business types. <br/>

      II will state this one last time for those who can be trifled with reading it; I am not an engineer, in any conventional sense. I am a soldier, a combat engineer. There is little or no engineering involved, mostly clearing mines, blowing things up, building fortifications and bridges and occasionally shooting people, when deployed, and doing exercises to practice these skills or sitting around doing nothing productive when I am not. Forgive the run on sentence. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I was railing against, really, speaking from a perspective of someone who had to pay for and eventually give up his own education, that one ought carefully consider the practical use of his chosen field of education, rather than wasting time. <br/> 
If you want to bring up again that your chosen field of education may be fun, I would answer that so are X-boxes. I think they are a hundred bucks, and will occupy your time as completely.

      It's not about 'fun' in the same sense that an Xbox is. It's about expanding your mind, learning how to think and analyze things on a deeper level, and just generally enriching your experience of the world. Can this be done on your own without a college degree? Sure, but it's generally much harder. And if you do happen to find a career in that field, it is much more likely to be one that you are actually personally interested in and that feels like it's a part of your life where you're accomplishing something important rather than a simple means of support that consists of goal-oriented tasks whose sole purpose is to make more money for the company you work for. Note that this also applies to doctors, research scientists, and some fields of law. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I grew up a poor immigrant who got all of his clothes from garage sales until about 7th grade, and my mom flat out told me that she had no money to pay for college, so believe me, I know where you're coming from. If I hadn't been lucky enough to get a full scholarship to a decent private school, I probably would have gone to community or state and ended up majoring in compsci or something of the sort. But if you have the opportunity, why not do something more enriching? The point is, like I said, having a college degree in anything will usually guarantee that you'll avoid starvation and homelessness. Beyond that, unless you have ambitions of luxury penthouses and BMW's, I see little reason to spend four years and 1/3 of your subsequent life doing something other than what interests you the most.

      It is highly recommended that if you are to major in philosophy that you believe firmly in some things so that your professor can blow your mind on a regular basis. If you do not go OH WOW all the time people will think that you are stuck up and then you will not be invited to join your universities philosophy club.

When people say "there's no good time to have a baby" that isn't to say that you should have a baby if you don't otherwise want one.  It's just that if your only reservation is that you don't have enough time or money, that it's not worth waiting for that situation to improve because it never will.

      That 20% downpayment presents a pretty big 'if'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And while it's true that one can spend pretty much an infinite ammount of money and time on raising a kid and never be entirely sure they've done all they could, I think there's a lot to be said for gaining some level of financial security first.  Child poverty is pretty frightening stuff.

      Back in the heady days when you could expect your house to double in value every ten seconds, I put down a 10% down payment by immediately rolling the other 10% into a HELOC.  I wouldn't recommend that now.  But I'm a guy on a message board for a cartoon.

      Back in the day a second mortgage to get to 20% was common, because both are treated the same taxwise.  Whereas paying PMI wasn't.  That's been fixed, so are as well off just paying PMI now, which is deductable.  Saves a ton of paperwork. <br/>

I'm kinda into this sort of thing because I have had to become an expert on mortgages in the general market lately.  Not a single one of our clients (who use our software in their mortgage section) have folded yet.

      The offence comes from it's paradigm. Molly assumes that "being a man" is accepting responsibility. But as we all know (including her), the same goes for "being a woman". Basically, I think Molly is identifying the difference, in a gender specific way, between Beef as a irresponsible boy and a responsible man. I assume this, because I assume Molly isn't sexist. Unfortunately her way of communicating is laden. And because language is always surrounded on all sides by the unexplained, people should give people a bit more leeway with their implied meanings. <br/>

      She may not be  <em>sexist</em>  per se, but she certainly seems to buy into traditional gender roles. Aside from the whole "be a man" thing we've just witnessed, there was also the time she talked about how  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224024128/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=06152007">women have to correct for a gender</a>  that would, um, eat farts or something.

      I'd go further in trying to explain this to people who might think we are just being oversensitive PC leftists. For me, at least, it's not even primarily a political/gender matter like in Pat's flowchart where I would see something and first think "oh that makes sense" and then realize "hey, that's offensive!" Rather, my immediate response when I see such portrayals is that they are tired cliches and just not that funny or original and are trying to provoke some sort of response of identification or solidarity from me that I can't provide because my life experience is simply not like that. Of course I realize that other people, possibly even a majority may identify with such things, but the whole point of good art is that it's supposed to transcend simplistic old cliches rather than wallowing in them.

      Oh, I agree. "Hulk Rules" is hands-down my favourite worst record ever, although the sheer weirdness of a couple of the songs on "Wrestlemania: The Album" gives it a run for its money (namely Savage's psychadelic scatting and Bret Hart's attempt at a ballad).   <br/>

      Oh, NOW I see what the fuss is about.  You read "chickening out" as not wanting a baby.  I read it only as "changing the subject."  Your reading would be fairly offensive, though no more than most of television and quite a bit of the greeting card section.  That cliche is tiresome to say the least, but that is not at all the way I read it.  I read it instead as "be a grownup about this important issue", but stated, as pointed out above by several others, in an unhelpful way.

      I'm afraid these newlyweds are 0 for 3. <br/> 
 <br/> 
1 is out.  Molly would have to be euphorically happy 110% of the time just to bring the couple's average happiness level above "man i should pull the trigger but dang i don't want to inconvenience Ray i mean what must it be like to come home and find some dude's brains all over the ceiling of your pool house damn maybe i should see if i can afford a place of my own to do this in." <br/> 
 <br/> 
2 is probably out.  Molly was last seen working at Starbucks, and they're downsizing rather painfully right now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And 3, well, I'm not sure Beef has paternal aspirations.  Maybe if he ended up with a spare Wonder Bread bag and needed something to put in it.

      Nah, I think a lot of people here would agree. The whole "being a man" line made me throw up in my mouth a little. This is the kind of logic that causes trash people to pop out babies by the dozen because getting girls pregnant is the only way that dudes of low mind can prove their "manhood".

      I was actually being charitable and presuming that Molly's reference to beef's insufficient manliness had to do with his (percieved) failure to discuss the matter directly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But now that I look at it again I think you're right.  It seems for all Molly's dislike of her parents' old-fashioned ways she's only questioning the surface of their beliefs, not the substance.

      Actually "being a man" = "not talking about things especially about having a baby", so I think Molly is not really grasping the concept of manhood. Beef is being weak, you cannot avoid the subject, it must be dealt with. So I think in this context "being a man" is the same as "stop being a child" something no-one wants to hear, I'll grant you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Besides, Beef can't be a man because he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me.

      The idea that maleness is an excuse for being incommunicative is not one I have much time for. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Beef isn't avoiding the subject, at least not for the first two responses (the ones that prompt her to tell him he's not 'being a man').  His first point is absolutely valid, and his second is a colourful but basically spot-on refutation to the idea that, because other people are doing it, they should do it too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Full disclosure: I really dislike Molly.  I think she's well written and realises the character archetype well, but I never want to spend much time around people like her.

      kung fu was basically a thing of monks. <br/>

Besides, they practiced the Martial Arts, not kung-fu. <br/>

Martial Arts are such that they can be incorpirated in regular battle. But no straight-up battle much ever happened in Mulan. <br/>

Also, here is alittle fun thing to notice from mulan; In the scene where the three guys dress up as women to get close to the big bad mongolian dude they each stuff their shirt with different fruit. However, Yao has two different fruits in his bra... to hilarious results!

When some major guy (I don't remember who) says something about seeking honor for China, his accent makes it sound EXACTLY like "seek on a... vagina".  I laughed out loud in the movie theater.  The girls around me all died inside because it was us and a pile of children.

      Well hell if Molly didn't bring just the weakest arguments ever for having a baby. So people half your age are having babies due about 80% to the fact that they follow some outlandish belief system in which it is forbidden to murder unborn children yet everyone holds secret parties whenever someone gets capital punishment for looking at a can of corn funny at the supermarket. So  <strong>what</strong> ?! I'm just hoping Molly don't ride that wild logic to the point of suggesting other potentially life-fucking activities kids half their age are doing (elegantly disheveled haircuts, Gwen Stefani albums). <br/>

      I think this all strikes at the root of something: I saw an interview at some point (can't find the link) where Onstad says something to the effect of that in high school he used to shave his head and hate the government but now he is just an ordinary married guy who worries about calories or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I often get this kind of vibe from fairly educated and intelligent, yet still middle-of-the-road type people: they ooze mild dissatisfaction with the humdrum trappings of 'normal' life, but are too entrenched in the ways they've been brought up to deviate too far from them. So they convince themselves that all these things are inevitable in a "well, it sucks, but what else are you gonna do" kind of way, while perhaps also  justifying this by devaluing other forms of living as some immature pubescent rebellion that everyone grows out of eventually. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm just saying that I would hate for this comic to follow the sitcom-esque mold of "guy is disgruntled about having a baby or changing diapers, but only enough so that he can amusingly grumble about it and not enough to actually cause serious conflict with his thoroughly boring wife (who, of course, is portrayed as wanting all of these 'normal' things because that's what all women want even if they say otherwise)." Even someone as great as Louis CK starts to get old when they harp too much on this theme. Maybe it's just that I personally can't relate, but I have a feeling it could be more of a generational thing.

      At least when he posts stupid things like hundred thousand penis bills it's easy to find them later and ignore them (considering assetbar is dumb about "not yet seen" replies). <br/>

      I get this vibe too.  Molly is a particularly good example of this archetype - the girl who feels that, because she wears stripy socks and listens to the Dandy Warhols, she can totally believe in rigid gender stereotypes, feel the main point in her life is to have babies and see her partner as having a secondary role in raising their children without being conservative.

      Err, some women  <em>want</em>  to have babies not because they believe in rigid stereotypes, but because they are cute, smell nice, love you in return in a way a cat or dog never can (especially a cat), and you know hormones (we've all seen  <em>My Cousin Vinnie</em>  right?).

      Well, the comments are only a year old (approx) so that compresses the concern about the future, and the arcs are a more recent thing, too.  I think the concern for the direction of the strip is actually mostly in the past couple of months.

      Ah, I see what you mean -- it is comments from people who care enough about the strip to read the back issues, but who don't trust it enough to keep being good.  I wonder how many of these posters also snoop on their respective girlfriends' text messages and fret when she fondles the grocery bag of rare South American lemons a bit too much.  'cause you know, that which you love can go [b]any[b] old nasty direction -- you never know when you'll come home to a terrible menage involving a travel blender and half a pair of dollar store pajamas.

Maybe what will happen is Achewood will lift a line from Terminator, characters all fighting against a future that they don't want to see. Roast Beef all 'dang man now I gotta do the militia thing out in the desert so assetbar won't get all sad about our poor quality but what the hell man we never had quality to begin with' <br/> 
 <br/> 
Except that, like all the rest of the hand-wringing, isn't going to happen. <br/>

I really just see Assetbar as a way for us to make each other laugh on top of the strip. Doesn't really seem to serve a purpose otherwise. All the 'I hope Onstad doesn't make this All My Children with cats and teddy bears' makes zero sense.

      Your name is either very similar or very much resembles a character from a H.P. Lovecraft (?) novel that describes the Elder Gods (who's names are often an unpronouceable glut of consonants). When they come to town they'll eat everyone and destroy everything slowly, by praising them they will let you be the first to be eaten when they come (to save you from the ensuing human horror).

      I'm betting she asks you because a good while back (when she was like, 10% younger) you said something about kids not knowing about cool.  So she bugged you to tell her what was cool.  So now she's hounding you as the default 'guy who knows shit', partly because you actually do know shit, and partly because she's still a little angry because she feels you implied she was dumb due to her age.

Dad: Sure they did. In fact those old photographs ARE in color. It's just the WORLD was black & white then.  <br/> 
Son: Really? <br/> 
Dad: Yep. The world didn't turn color until sometime in the 1930s, and it was pretty grainy color for a while, too. <br/>

Then later he was still dressed as a philosophy guy, which reminded me of how he was dressed as a philosophy guy in the previous panel. Also, I liked the word bubbles. I don't know what Insane Clown Posse or the Niagara falls are, since it hasn't been explained in this strip and I am forbidden from referring to any knowledge outside of Achewood. I am sure it is funny though, because Onstad is funny and he makes funny comics like this one.</a>

      people like me too.  not people in your community.  But by definition, that is why it is your community. But I guess I am a shithead, for wanting to ethnically cleanse assetbar of your community.  I should probably just go find some other community where people like me, and leave yours be in peace.  Probably keir should too.  But keir is right... you guys and gals are pretty dopy most of the time.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Most people do crave junk food every now and then, so why not a free flow of idle stream-of-consciousness splut YES NO KNIVES THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID etc etc... why not crave that every now and then...  but EVERY FUCKING DAY?  couldn't you guys go chat on IRC or messenger or something, instead of turning assetbar into your own personal clochea of mind-douche detrius?  I think that's all keir is trying to say here.  I mean come on... Assetbar saves this shit forever, and has limited capacity... the whole fucking page loads every time... you can't collapse threads... maybe you could talk about something a little more substantive on here a little more frequently....  that seems to be what keir is saying...   <br/> 
anyway... whatever... sorry for my mispellings.  I could run spell check, but I don't care to.  My spelling sucks in several languages.  If you can say that, then you can criticize me on spelling.  otherwise, STFU.   <br/> 
anyway.  someone should mail you all anthrax letters.

      Well gee, I guess that makes perfect sense. The 99% of us who like Assetbar the way it is just fine will move to IRC to accomodate two or three whiny turds. Wouldn't it be easier for you and Keir to make your own private IRC channel where you can make your oh-so-relevant-and-important comments? I give it about 5 minutes before Keir unplugs his computer and files a restraining order. <br/>

I cannot describe how much of a pathetic little shit you are. All of your purported gripes and disdain are complete bullshit. If you hated us all so much, you wouldn't have tried so hard to fit in when you first started posting. You just threw a tantrum when people didn't like your self-indulgent ramblings and now are trying to convince us that your mission was to disrupt the forum all along. Sorry, not buying it. Your wounded little ego still shows through all your posts. Are you ever honest with yourself? About everything? <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's funny that you mention the anthrax thing because you fit exactly the same profile as that scientist. I'm sorry that most of us have normal lives and like the same cultural things. I'm sorry that we're not emotionally damaged unemployed 30-year olds with superiority complexes and self-control issues. You don't need a webcomic, you need a fucking support group, and you're not gonna get that here.

      Those people are throwbacks from the Great Handface Fiasco of '87 (Not actual date). Basically, as was bound to eventually happen, everyone here suddenly decided that they wanted to emulate Heccibiggs. Hilarity ensued. <br/>

      There was a Thing in April that transpired that has come to be known as Handface Weekend.  Heccibiggs had the first handface icotar, and then Margargaret was all like "Why can't I also have a handface avacon?" and so she did.  Then it was, as the saying goes, "off to the races."  And then it turned out that all the chicks in addition to being funny and smart are also very cute, and all the dudes are handsome, but I am saying that in a way that is totally not gay.  Also, to be accurate, none of this applies to hedonismbot. <br/>

      Welcome.  It was a wild weekend a couple months ago.  Hecci had always had her hand in her picture (we didn't know it was really her at first) then Loneal chaged hers, it became a challenge, and tons of us posted hand-face shots.  We then all became much more chummy (I'm still distant because I'm old and engaged) with Facebook links and such.  My present iconavatar is a piece of found art in the hand-face mode.  I somehow like hiding behind a woman's likeness these days.

      The 4/25 handface breakout still look pretty good.  Lots of Assetbarnarians have kept their handface pics up.  Notable exceptions are spiney and elbow, which does ruin part of the thread.  Oh well, you really had to be there anyway.

There was a character that was particularly cool. At some point he and a friend we having a conversation that amounted to, "Fuck fun!" "Yeah, fun suck" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I Always though that amounted to the most badass thing to say.
