      At the risk of sounding trite, what could possibly be better than burning one with Ray Smuckles? Put on some Toto, get him reminiscing about small times, maybe win some money off him in a friendly match of Nintendo Golf, & settle down with some chilly Stellas and a copy of Road Warrior. Sort of like if my stoner friends had mad dough and were anthropomorphic cats.

If Echo the Dolphin had been multiplayer, I would be in jail right now for multiple counts of homicide. It took being dumped by my first girlfriend and having to live with her for another month past that for me to complete that damned game.

      On a similar note,  <em>Disney's Adventures in the Magic Kingdom</em>  was a curiously difficult game, given its target audience. I finally beat the fucking thing, but it took a long time and it wasn't easy.

      Odd. I remember it as being an incredibly easy game. Specifically that I rented it one morning, took it home, beat it in a few hours and was able to take it back to the store and get a new game from them because it was so damn easy. <br/>

Weird, but true. It's a strong memory of mine for some reason.

      I don't know, that says to me he's pretty cheap. I mean, he could probably buy a medium-sized Hawaiian island and devote it entirely to the cultivation of marijuana, yet he has to bum it from his at best lower-middle-class friend.

      Perhaps Ray believes that the residents of said town normally keep a joint tucked in their ear like some people would keep a pencil or a regular cigarette. I've never been to Jamaica, let alone this town, and I don't believe that said people would tote their green in such a manner. However, I can see Ray believing that Kingstonians do such a thing.

      I'm sorry, no hard feelings were meant. I thought my original comment was funny when I posted it, but when I stumbled upon it recently I was embarrassed, as I perceived it as kind of a petty, rude thing to say (I have been accused of being an asshole about other people's linguistic mistakes in the past). So, this was merely a case of seeing my own perceived faults in another. Your comment was funny, I shouldn't have said what I did. <br/>

Two of Ray's other suggestions refer to byproducts of weed - shake and 'kief' (a US misnomer for resin glands based on the fact that the Moroccan term for cannabis foliage is 'khif'), so a Kingston Sideburn seems most likely to be reclaimed cannabis of the type you describe.
