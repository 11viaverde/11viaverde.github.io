      What you seem to forget, gentlemen, is that there are many parents in the world who would be glad to have their unmarried 24 year old sons remain ignorant of the uses of a boner. Mine, for example. Which brings me to my question....is it weird I have a boner?

      On a semi-related note, I have a friend who is a doctor in the emergency ward of is sort of between a lower-class country town and a rural city (Moe, Victoria, for those who know it).  You know that urban myth that hospitals constantly have to deal with dudes coming in with obscure ass complaints and who always have the excuse of "err, umm, I was vaccuming/putting in a new lightbulb/working on the car/etc  <strong>naked</strong> , and I slipped and accidentally sat on it and now it's up my ass and I really fucked myself up"? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah, well, apparently that's all too true.  She gave intricate details of the internals working of the rectal cavity, how far is  <em>too far</em>  (interestingly, it's not that far!  I guess it  <em>is</em>  designed as the "out hole"), how they get it out, how you can really fuck yourself up if you force it  <em>past where it should</em>  - she knows this situation very well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personally, if I were to stick objects up my pooter, I can think of a few ways this situation would be easier to get out of: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. Buy a dildo.  Or at least use something phallic-shaped (don't, for example, use a rectangular mp3 player - which ironically was looping "Yesterday" by The Beatles, that you oculd just faintly hear from the outside).  Many fruit and vegetables will surely do the trick.  Additionally, use some lube for God's sake. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. If it all goes awry, don't make up an excuse.  Just say "eh, I was curious."  They still won't have much respect for you, but they'll respect you a little more. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. Don't force it, or use anything too long. <br/> <br/> <br/> Dude, I could be gay.  That shit sounds  <em>easy</em> .

      You forgot the absolute, most important aspect:  <strong>make certain that it has a flared base</strong> . Anal beads are basically the only real exception to this rule and even then you probably want to choose a set where the possibility of losing them is more or less moot (e.g. no chance of the string breaking or such). <br/>

      I figured it was related to Peter, but I was confused about the lack of churchage.  XD  It appears your Latin is mostly correct, except for "bone", which is "os" in accusative, and is a neuter noun.  I would resyntacize it to  <br/> 
"Tu petrus es, et super petrum os meum aedificabo."  <br/>

      You can keep saying that the pun only works in Latin, but the New Testament will just sit there being written in Greek and proving you wrong. <br/>

      You are lucky I no longer have any lames because ending your sentences in verbs is not sexy. Not in the least. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm also not too happy with moving "es" from between "tu" and "petrus", but that I could let slide. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Latin doesn't have strict syntax, but trying to put verbs at the end when you don't even have to due to using a terribly-designed language? Man, that shit a'int no kind of cool.

      My teachers like it when I put my verbs at the end.  That is the default of what I do except when I judge that it looks better somewhere else.  And that is typically how the Romans wrote.  And I personally enjoy writing in a different syntax than I do in English.  I don't have to put the verbs at the end, but I don't have to put them anywhere else either.  It's not as though it's going out of your way; putting them at the end is the default.  And it certainly gives more oomph to statements!   <br/> 
"Terrible-designed"?  Why is this?  You are implying that having declension indicate case instead of syntax is a worse design, but there is no reason to think this.  In fact, it gives you greater freedom while writing poetry.

      While very true I think the greater issue is that real men do not visit Crate and Barrel. They purchase their house and kitchenwares from a place that charges proper prices and has the common decency to not stock all sorts of terrible items and the glossiest and most vapid of cookbooks outside of a digest in the supermarket check-out. <br/>

I will, however, admit to a passing fancy with CB2, their modern shop. A brief tour showed me plenty of furnishings that I would greatly like to own, but look too nice to be allowed into my crappy apartment.

      The police rarely believe that you were going so fast the red light blueshifted to green. Of course, that would mean that you were also traveling at approximately 57,747 km/s (129,176,360 mph) so there would probably be a relatively stiff fine for that itself.

      I have a bourbon story.  A friend and I had consumed enough to become fairly conversational (let me add that it takes very little for me to get to this point).  We were discussing the nature of altruism.  Him: I don't believe it really exists. <br/> 
Me: Of course it exists.  Why else would we have the word altruism? <br/> 
Him: Yeah, but, like, we have the word "dragons" and dragons don't exist! <br/> 
Me: You know, I subscribe to the theory that people found dinosaur fossils and made up stories about dragons.  Similarly, perhaps the concept of altruism has been constructed from a skewed understanding...of kindness fossils! <br/>
