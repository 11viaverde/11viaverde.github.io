      Besides... Bangladeshi folk are worse than Pakistani folk, on average.... even if they are basically a similar flavour.

OR to take bribes to throw down international cricket matches, for that matter.

      To be honest, my response was more one of confusion than of ridicule. I find it pretty difficult to get morally upset over anything that happens within this strip, most of whose humor is completely absurd. I mean, the term in question was used not only by a fictional character, but a character who is fictional within a fictional setting, and the term is fairly meaningless to this entire hemisphere.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As to the subject of lames, I agree it's up to personal choice, but I find it almost too much work to parse through the hundred-plus comments for an entire thread and spend energy letting someone know that I think they're stupid. To do it to one or two comments where it's a knee-jerk reaction, yes, that's fine and is probably what the feature is there for, but to do it over and over again to relatively innocuous comments seems borderline cruel. It feels like you're going out of your way to put a blemish on someone's day. I haven't even lamed you yet, because I do think things like this deserve to be talked about.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suppose, yes, it's all up to personal choice, and it is just a tally next to a moniker on the internet on a website about a bunch of high cats who drink and fall down all the time. But then if it's so meaningless, to devote time to something that's so minutely disheartening...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well. I'd just prefer it if we were polite. But this is the internet, after all. You perfectly have the right to lame every one of my comments, regardless as to whether or not you disagree with it or even read it at all.

      Though if we get our knickers in a knot every time something gives us hackles in our cockles all we are doing is showing the world that we are weak, meat filled pastries to be made fun of and taken advantage of.

      Paki is sometimes used in headlines in Australian newspapers to refer to the Pakistani Cricket team (in the same way that Brits is used instead of Britain).  <br/>

This is sometimes used as evidence that Australians are innately racist by hyperventilating Guardian readers who forget that the term is only offensive because of the many  <em>Brit</em>  racists.

      I think this is pretty much the most accurate description of a joke, ever.  I understand the word is offensive, and it might strike a certain chord with some readers, but at it's core, it is a joke.  Something written with the intent to humor.  It would really lose it's effectiveness if it was p*ki or "Acceptable Western European Racial Epithet".

      Just a tag-along, it's not Ray saying Paki.  It's a character intended to be very unlikeable.  Would it be offensive if in a comic parody of David Duke a writer included some racial slurs?  Of course not, it's not an implication of support for that sort of speech or person, it's a characterization meant to be funny.  Also, I think a very good point was made about the Anti-Abortion protesters in an earlier strip.  No one got very offended there, and it makes sense, given Achewood's demographic.  But, there was no need for anyone to get too hurt there either, as all of these examples are  <em>just jokes</em> .  <br/> <br/> <br/> When Onstad illustrates the Turner Diaries, I'll start  to get nervous.

      Surely the context of its use is not comparable to 'hearing a friend say something quite offensive in an offhand way', but rather a purposefully racist fictional character, reflecting a certain reality, in a fictional comic strip? Are you offended by the depiction of racist characters? They are a pretty necessary aspect of any media that wants to portray anything real.

      I should know better than to get into this, but that's ridiculous. Are you really wondering if Onstad "meant" it? Have you even examined this logically? The word is being used by a crass, nationalist stereotype that both Cornelius and the implied author find distasteful. If what neonaoneo says is true and Al Murray doesn't use the word, then Onstad is guilty of a slight mischaracterization at worst. But your example with the friend doesn't work at all, since he'd be presumably saying it in his own speech. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Words are nothing, context is everything. But if you want to get your feathers ruffled at the mere presence of certain words because it makes the world easier for you to process, go right ahead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
P.S. "Paki" was actually used in The Office and I don't recall any great controversy then. <br/>

      But seriously, if Cornelius is a genuine anglophile, he might be visibly offended by the use of the term "paki." It is not clear that Onstad is being consistent with his characterisation, or if he is. This is an issue in the strip, and it is worth talking about.

      Yes, because there were no Pakistanis in 1960s England, and absolutely no racial tensions of any kind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As to his always living in pre-WWII England, he seems to be mostly engaged with America and life there. Of course, that's just my interpretation - a more objective description would simply be that Onstad seems not to know what he's doing with Cornelius half the time.

      The first published use that the OED lists is in 1964 (1964 Guardian 15 Apr. 8/4). This is implies currency in speech for several years previously. It was certainly a time with enough racial tension that Mr Bear *might*, if he had any contact whatsoever with English dialect after that time, be more offended even than those of us who were not alive in the Britain of that time and climate.

      I figure he'd normally be offended, but judging from the timelapse, he's probably reached the point where he's tuning the publican out and just wants to install his goddamn printer.

      I never said Onstad was being offensive; just wondering, out loud, if he really knew the connotations and significance of that particular word. The guys who wrote The Office certainly did, which is where the uncomfortable humour comes from. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If Onstad does understand just how loaded that word is, then it actually makes that last panel pretty fucking sublime. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If he doesn't (and let's face it, as he lives thousands of miles away from any place where this word is in (shamefully) common usage, no sane person could hold a grudge against him if he doesn't), then he may have acccidentally, needlessly, used a rather offensive term where something else would have worked just as well, thinking that it was just a 'cute' Britishism like 'bollocks' or 'wank'.  <br/>

I agree there's no point geting upset over words, I would just like to think that people understand what those words mean when they use them, that's all.

It simply no longer startles you on an emotional level.  This could explain why Cornelius is not startled by the racist publican just as you or I might be blase about, say, Fox 'news.'

      As for the reader being startled by an epithet in the context of an achewood strip, yeah, many readers would be, initially.  This is not to say that many if not most of these readers would also immediately understand the context.  An epithet is one of the most powerful types of words.  I think it has a similar effect as when your peripheral vision catches sight of a fist flying towards your face.  Immediately, before you even have time to consciously deconstruct the context, (say, perhaps, it is your friend playfully trying to scare you,) immediately your brain processes this stimuli and actually generates a physiological fight-or-flight type of response.  Heart rate quickens, higher-level cognitive function takes a back seat as the brain focuses all attention on sensory input.  A word can produce this reaction, and if it is in a context where the reader is not normally expecting it, the reader may do a sort of double-take before she catches herself and realizes that it is, in fact, just a joke.  Yes, catching the audience off-guard is generally a tool of the comedian, although, it certainly is often a stretch to accuse the comedian of purposefully pushing low-level deeply visceral buttons of the audience.    I think we all have these buttons, and to a large degree we each need to take personal and contextual responsibility for guarding these buttons and allowing them to be pressed or not...  The extent to which this responsibility is our own or that of our interlocutor depends entirely on context.  In the case of the specific context of Achewood, I would say that hey, epithets are part of the package.  The disclaimer is implied, I think, by the overall character and take-no-hostages artistic brilliance of the strip.   Authors working in such an artistic context by definition do not generally selectively self-edit.  Is it pressing an intellectual button to startle the audience by having Philippe blurt out an epithet?  Yes.  And it is perfectly acceptable in *any* context, I say, for an author to intend to intellectually startle the audience.  Now, a side effect of such a technique when it involves an epithet, of course, is that *no matter what the context,* you can be assured that some of the audience will be startled on a fundamentally visceral level.  Obviously, this is usually not the intent, and in many contexts, it would be unreasonable to expect the author to take responsibility for the audience's own management of it's own visceral buttons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Someone mentioned affective fallacy.  I think that there is also a sort of codependent affective fallacy at work here, where we tend to judge the value of a work by the response that we think likely to be provoked by the work for a pathologically innane audience (John Q. Public.)  Those who are affected by codependent affective fallacy wish not that the author should be custodian of their own visceral emotional buttons, but should be custodian of those of the public at large. <br/>

      You are quite possibly the most confusing Assetbar user. How do you go from a post full of nightmarish grammar that suggests using a bot to raise your member status to what is perhaps the most solid and well-written socio-linguistic analysis of Achewood I have seen so far? Can you just decide whether you're going to be inane or brilliant, and stick with one? Thanks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, chubby for affective fallacy. Interestingly, in this case the easiest way to answer accusations of "that's racist" is in fact to commit the intentional fallacy (though I don't really think it's a fallacy).

      To contribute a slight joke, once my friend was riding in a car with my Turkish friend Mahmud, who's a great fan of hip hop. They stopped at a red light and a car pulled up next to us with two black men in it. Mahmud recognized the song, then grinned happily at them, waved, and said, "What is up, niggers?!"  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, he had no idea how serious the term was. My friend said he immediately started thrusting himself down in the seat out of sight, and maybe started frantically kicking the floorboards to see if somehow he could hide in the undercarriage.

      I have never understood why people choose to be offended by certain words, regardless of their context. In America, if you use the word "nigger", even in a sentence like "Hey I heard some asshole call a guy a 'nigger' earlier today and I was so angry that he could be so ignorant," you become some sort of fucking monster. The concept is absolutely absurd to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The way I've always seen it is like this: by stigmatizing certain words, especially racial slurs, to the point where you can't even be heard gently whispering the word in a well-meaning context, all we're doing is giving empowering racists who actually want to use the word to verbally abuse other people. If people just stopped giving a fuck and calling words like "nigger" and "paki" ugly and vile in and of themselves, the words would cease to mean anything and we could all have a nice picnic together and be able to use our full ranges of expression without worrying about making anyone cry. <br/>

      People in Canada say Paki too. Nobody is upset by this unless they are themselves of Pakistani descent. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It may be a VERYVERYVERYbad thing to say in Britain, but here it is nowhere near the level of nigger, spic, or even kike(which is even rarer to hear than nigger) <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess what I'm really trying to say here is that this is the internet. No need to pretend to be offended for other races just to show how super-unracist you are.

      My online presence can now die happy.  Classic anti-climax at the end.  I would say thank you, but I'm not sure if that's what you want, or even if it is warranted.  Let me explain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The frequent thought when reading Manflesh's Assetbar fanfics is "wait...is this a satire on the internal politics of Assetbar?  Is each character's affiliation, role and personality in the fanfic a reference to how they act and interact online here?  Am I included in this because he likes me, because he's subtly taking the piss, or were the popular people chosen and slotted into a pre-made fanfic randomly?  Or is he just doing it because it's fucking awesome?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it's best if the answer is left enigmatic. <br/> <br/> <br/> Still.  I've never kicked so much ass in a first-person shooter in my life.  Violence  <em>rules</em> .

      Good call.  That was on the first Mahler recording I ever fell in love with, the 6th.  Since then I've found Bernstein to be too histrionic for Mahler, though it works on the 6th.  Best Mahler recording I have is Klemperer's Das Lied Von Der Erde with Christina Ludwig.  Seriously heart rending shit.

      I get the creepy feeling that all of these Asherdan destroys ALL posts are actually hinting at just the thing tekende suggested, a prophecy. That Manflesherdan will hit Assetbar with enough horrible crap to watch this place choke and fall. Just for the whole meta comedy of it all. <br/>

      Unless I am mistaken, "Slashfic" more implies the pre-imagined characters having non-canonical sexual relations with one another (generally ranging from mildly homoerotic to  <em>raging</em>  BDSM). <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's only a matter of time before it happens to one of us.  I've had my moment of ego-inflating thickly laced with ambiguous foreboding of satire, and I think I came out alright. <br/>

If it does turn into full-blown slashfic, I'm kinda scared for the next guy to star.

(footnote:  If I'd wanted to demonstrate how well-read I am, I would have changed the last sentence to "It's not exactly Tristam Shandy," but I didn't.  So I'm not showing off!  Except possibly in this footnote)

      I try to evangelize achewood to my friends but they complain that it's "too much reading."  So far I've had spotty success pointing out specific strips that remind me of interactions with them.  The most recent one was the Boy George strip, as I can envision a friend and myself having that conversation then the same reaction.  "Fuckin' A!" has become a small catchphrase/inside joke now, but they still refuse to read the total awesomeness of the strip as a whole. <br/>

      Swans are a very nutrient-rich fare, suitable for those who work three jobs.  While the publican also consumes entire swans whenever possible, the excess in his consumption can be seen in his jowls.  His doctor has long encouraged him to busy himself with more labour-intensive activities than finger pointing.

On the present page, at the top left, for a while instead of Highest Rated, for me it said something like "strips you have not yet viewed" or something... or no wait... it said "highest rated strips you have not yet viewed" or something to that effect... so I guess the one strip you're missing wasn't considered anything special.

      But, in a rather Pythonic fashion, the last panel punchline itself was pretty crap and run-of-the-mill, webcomics-wise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The question is - was this deliberate?  Is it a post-modern artistic jab at your average comic strip formula? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or perhaps it's just because, hey man, it's ok to be kinda formulaic every once in a while.  Don't be so picky, and enjoy simple humour.  Gotta mix it up and stuff. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And more to the point, the essence of Achewood is not the destination, but the journey. Arcs are sometimes just dropped because he doesn't care about them anymore, deus ex machina'd like fuckin'  <em><strong>crazy</strong></em> , and/or wrapped up quickly with little closure on the story when you think they're a stayer - but that's all part of the joke!  That's what makes it funny. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What makes it an  <em>interesting</em>  read is the fact that in the middle of this (admitted) late-night/early-morning-contrived madness where he's managed to do whatever the fuck he wants and we clamour to read it and try to figure out how the mysterious man works (it is such a damn good thing he doesn't post here regularly in order to keep up the mystique), he also manages to put in deep long-term character development and, amazingly, continuity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I may get lamed out for explaining the obvious/criticising the strip/writing a long post/generally being a douche, but whatever man.  I'll make some b-movie reference later to make up for it, I promise.

      I'm sorry, but deep, long term character development? Not Achewood. While we do get to see characters deal with their problems (sometimes) and we occasionally get insight into their motives, the characters don't really change. Ray's still the same laid back cat he always was, Phillipe's still a naive bright eyed youth, Cornelius is still a sauve british man and so on. Roast Beef, it's true that he stands up for himself from time to time, but he's largely still a nervous wreck. The only character to truly undergo change was Pat, who became nicer and more easy going after coming out, at least for a time.

      I think what people mean when they talk about character development is that jokes evolve based on the known characters, and not that the characters change a whole lot.  They change only slightly.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
For example, this arc deals with Connie and a computer.  Connie used to use a typewriter, (I think) and therein lies the potential for humour.  What would a computer made for someone like Cornelius be like?  Onstad posits that such a computer would be disappointing in a manner unique from the manner in which people of more pedestrian persuasion (such as I) find computers disappointing; yet at heart, the disappointments remain the same. <br/> 
 <br/> 
sorry that was so long and pretentious--but being on the internet does that to people.

      This thread reminded me of a story that I will relate to you assetbears. <br/> 
I was once assigned to read the book  <em>Jack Maggs</em> .  Whilst reading it, my professor told me that there was a brief homosexual encounter, very subtle, that I should take note of.  Not 15 minutes later I got to a passage describing how a character had "reamed, rogered, and ploughed him until he could scarcely walk the next day," or something to that effect.  That word will forever be linked to the feeling of my jaw slowly dropping.

While initially performing convincingly, in every test run, 'Mr. Teal' would, without fail, berate the user's underappreciation of "honey," spew offensive (and possibly racist) vulgarities, suffer what could only be described as a sort of cybernetic stress heart attack, and terminate itself. While certainly a step forward in progress, it is the finding of this committee that further development of 'Mr. Teal' be abandoned, and the rights sold to our subsidiary in Liverpool.

      Hmmm... I have to say that a lot of the British stuff in Achewood, while funny, just doesn't quite sit right. It's funny (as ever), but there's something subtly wrong about it.... he always gets the language slightly wrong in that way that most americans seem to when they're imitating british people. It's still a bit 'Dick van Dyke', and it doesn't work nearly as well as the rest of his language.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Apart from the strip about all our celebrities looking like middle-school teachers... that was a dead-on bullseye.

      It is really odd that this word is considered derogatory, since "paki" means "pure" in the local language (Urdu). <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's even more to the story of the name of the country.  It was invented by a political writer in 1934, using letters from five districts of what was then all part of British India.  The "P" came from Punjab, the "A" from Afghania,  the "K" from Kashmir, the "S" from Sindh, and the "tan" from Baluchistan. <br/>

      Does it matter if the the character is portrayed in a positive or negative light? Since when does Onstad have an obligation to uphold a shining example of good morals in his work? Isn't it just as relevant for a person you like to be racist in a way that makes you uncomfortable?  <br/>

I have a problem with people who actually think it was WRONG for Onstad to do this and have expressed that. Who are you to say what kind of characters he portrays and what he does? <br/>
