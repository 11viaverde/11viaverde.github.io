      Le Grand Magot (The Great Ape) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Le Grand Magot was a tradition practiced at Silver Moon, a restaurant in Saigon, ~1952-1975, involving the ritualistic death of a specially trained chimpanzee. The ritual was created by the Silver Moon's owner, Nguyen Van Vingh, a Vietnamese-born chef who studied cooking at several schools in France during 1946-1952. It was popular with the French and Vietnamese upper class, and later, high-ranking American government officials, military officers, and some members of the public, such as journalist Walter Cronkite. <br/> <br/> <br/> Ritual <br/> 
 <br/> 
Though the consumption of various portion's of the ape's body was the supposed aim of the exercise, it has been argued and is generally accepted that the performance was as much a piece of performance art as a step in the preparation of the meal. There were several variations of the practice. Usually a group event, by far the most common version involved a designated patron (known as Le Chef) selecting an ape he wished to kill, from an enclosure where they were kept. The ape was then bathed and shaved, as Le Chef and his party were served light refreshments in the killing room. Alcohol was not served until after the ape's death, both for safety reasons, and to preserve the purity of the emotional experience. Individuals who appeared to be already intoxicated were never allowed to participate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Having received six months to one year's training, the shaved ape was led in to the killing room, to within approximately three feet of Le Chef, who dressed in a loose-fitting cotton robe. Protective eyeglasses were provided. The ape, having performed this ritual many times in training, carried, in one hand, a single-shot pistol, and in the other, a single .44 magnum pistol cartridge. A sheet of white silk was drawn across the room, and drawn taut, separating Le Chef from the rest of the party. A spotlight was then switched on, casting the shadows of both Le Chef and the ape on the sheet, in profile. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Le Chef would take the pistol and cartridge and proceed to load the gun. At this sound, the ape would step forward on to a large, golden platter. When the hammer of the pistol was cocked, the ape would sign, using International Sign Language, the phrase "Thank you," then tap a point on its forehead midway between the eyes laterally, and approximately one inch higher than the eyes, vertically. This was were Le Chef placed the muzzle of the pistol, and pulled the trigger. The bullet normally exited the skull through the back, and was stopped by a wall of sandbags, concealed by a stretched painter's canvas. The canvas, bearing a bullet hole and a portion of the ape's blood and brain matter, was quickly dried and varnished, and given to Le Chef at the end of the evening. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The ape, falling on the platter, was carried to the kitchen by the staff. Normally, a stew consisting of the heart, the remainder of the brain matter, the lungs, and, optionally, the testicles, would be prepared. Wine was served, mixed with a portion of the ape's blood, which contained a small amount of opium, that the ape had been made to smoke earlier in the night. It is accepted now that the concentration of the drug in the blood was not high enough to cause a discernible effect in a full-grown human adult, and that the effects mentioned by Chefs were most likely attributable to placebo. The rest of the carcass was discarded. <br/> <br/> <br/> Pistol <br/> 
 <br/> 
The pistol was a special model, manufactured in very small batches by a local gunsmith. It was break-action, much like today's Thompson-Center Contender model. After the ceremony, the pistol could be purchased by Le Chef, but molten lead would be poured in to the barrel, so that it could no longer be used for a less noble purpose. The .44 magnum caliber was chosen because it was very successful at penetrating the skull of an ape. <br/> <br/> <br/> Variations <br/> 
 <br/> 
Originally, there were to be two types of ceremonies, the aforementioned, and one where the ape in fact shot itself in the head. However, in practice, the ape often simply wounded itself, and took an inconveniently long time to fully expire. It was felt that the most artistically pure way for the ape to die was from a single wound, and that shooting a thrashing ape multiple times significantly reduced the drama of the event. A harness of leather was briefly experimented with, which held the pistol in the correct position on the ape's head, but it too was rejected for artistic reasons. Occasionally, a Chef would request to use their own pistol, but this proved to have several drawbacks. First, the pistol might not be powerful enough to immediately kill the ape. Secondly, it was felt that much of the depth of the ceremony was lost when the ape did not deliver the means of its own destruction, a major consideration given that apes often expressed confusion when presented with an unfamiliar pistol design, sometimes fumbling with, and in one case, breaking, a Chef's personal firearm. <br/> <br/> <br/> End of the Era <br/> 
 <br/> 
During the Vietnam War, the cost of importing and training apes skyrocketed, making the ceremony only available to the super rich or powerful. Combined with more difficult circumstances all around, the ceremony began to be practiced less and less often. The real death blow, however, came in mid-April of 1975. On April 17, as the city lay under siege, a stray mortar round hit the outdoor enclosure where the apes were kept, killing all but two. Nguyen Van Vingh, knowing that it would be impossible to start from scratch, reportedly shot the two surviving apes, Lucien and Jean-Claude, before turning the gun on himself. His last words, reported by his cook, who was present at the time, were: "Tonight, I shall finally join you, my brave and noble pets. Goodbye." <br/> <br/> <br/> Controversy <br/> 
 <br/> 
Walter Cronkite never made a public statement about his involvement with Nguyen Van Vingh or the Silver Moon restaurant. It was noted, though, that from 1968 onwards, a red-spattered canvas with a hole in the center adorned the wall of his dressing room in the CBS studios.

      I saw in a cookbook once that cilantro tasting like soap or plastic is an indication of a mild allergy to the herb.  Not enough to do any damage, just makes your taste buds go all weird.

      You could make an alcoholic beverage that tastes exactly like ginger ale and clocks in at 6.8%, if that's what you want -- use malt for the alcohol and just don't bother with hops. I seriously doubt that putting mint and fennel in an ale can produce anything like that, but I'll be horsefucked if I'm going to google a beverage that pansy-assed. <br/>

      In the cold light of afternoon, I retract and suggest you use a small amount of hops, perhaps 1/4 what one uses in a stout, which I believe would technically make it an ale. Still doubting the mint and fennel, but maybe hemp. I reckon Ray's comments are recipes that Onstad wondered if they would work while stoned. Also I am spending too much time contemplating a beverage that I would not actually drink. Next thing you know I'll be wearing my initial on a sweatshirt and bemoaning Penny.

      It's actually fairly easy and inexpensive to teach yourself to make malt beverages (as opposed to winemaking, which is easy and inexpensive to suck at), and there's a brewer's supply store in every major city in the US, as well as most college towns. In case, you know, you want a bunch of people under 21 hanging around.
