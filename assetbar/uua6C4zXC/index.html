      One time I had a friend who got drunk downtown and woke up with a tattoo bandage on his upper arm. He had no idea what it was, and no one else did, either. He had just gotten hammered, wandered off, and had someone write in his goddamn flesh.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, you can't take the tattoo bandage off for a while, otherwise you'll really fuck shit up, so he had to sit around sweating and wondering just what the fuck he got. Was is MOM? Was it a picture of a naked chick in a top hat, thus ensuring unemployment in any decent job? Was it just some random chick's name? <br/> 
 <br/>

      No no, there are worse.  This is pretty bad, but I've heard of only one worse one.... <br/> 
*dramatic music of story telling* <br/> 
 <br/> 
A friend of mine (we'll call him Stan for anonymity*) worked with a guy in car detaling.  Every day this guy would work with long sleeves on under his work jumpsuit, even in the hot hot Melbourne summer**.  Then when they all got changed, he changed by himself,  and Stan never got to see. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Stan obviously wondered what this dude's story was, 'cause it'd have to be  <em>fuckin' serious</em> .  Was he a cutter?  Was it a tat?  It's gotta be a tat.  Nasty ass one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So he asked a workmate what the deal was, and he said that yeah, he'd seen it, and yeah, it's a tat.  Apparently the story was he got horrendously drunk one night and thought a tat was a good idea.  I love stories that start this way.  He wakes up the next morning with...a troll doll up his left arm.  Body up the forearm, bright pink hair up till the shoulder.  Yeah, he covers it up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And that, my friend, is the worst tattoo I've  <strong>ever</strong>  damn heard of. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*The anonymity is not needed. <br/> 
**Which could quickly change to a cold cold Melbourne winter in about 10 minutes, but that's another meteorological story for another non-tattoo related day.

      I have a friend who got a tattoo - on his neck - in memory of his recently deceased nephew.  The tattoo says "In loveing memory..."  That, if not the saddest thing, is pretty damn sad.

However, you also write kinda lamely and over-antagonistically.  But is that reason for laming?  Ah the choices.  I'll decide later.

      Fair enough.  I also don't get the chuckles like I used to with them, but they still make me smile - although, granted, not as often as I'd like them to. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That having been said, I think you're setting the old stuff up on too high a pedestal.  Yeah, it was clever, but there was a HELL of a lot of toilet and/or dick jokes.  And also pop culture references - not as many as most webcomics out there who churn them out like their lives depend on it, but they're still there. (I'd actually argue that the  <em>lack</em>  of pop culture references is what always made Achewood appealing.  There were culture references, but often really obscure ones that made me feel inferior for not getting.)  He's putting in a lot of all these sort of jokes lately, but at the same time, we also came off two stories off the top of my head that weren't - Todd's tv show, and Ray's brother.  Todd's show was classic Todd being a cokehead jerkwad (to the extreme this time), and Ray's brother was more abstract interpersonal humour.  The quality of either is up to the individual. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for your writing style - eh, I think you come off as too aggressive to be taken seriously, in all honesty.  There's a lot of trolls on the net, Acheworld included, and that's how they generally write - wanting to start a fight.  If you weren't so aggressive and antagonistic in your posts you wouldn't get lamed to all hell like you do, I reckon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or maybe you would because you dare say that it's not up to standard, but not as much as you do.  Depends what you want - internet respect (which, really, means nothing but gives you a buzz of feeling respected) or internet hate (which, really, means nothing but gives you a buzz from getting into fights).  Either are understandable, but you can't whine about people laming you if that's what you want in the first place.  Depends what you actually want, I suppose.

      YOU PRETENTIOUS BASTARD. Ach, I agree about Achewood and cultural reference. I would like to put forward the idea that there is a right and wrong way to relate your comic to, or riff on, popular culture, and achewood does it, as it does so many things, the right way.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What really sets achewood apart for me is its carefully considered minimalism, the way it establishes a strong narrative voice in my head without having to spell out just what that voice sounds like.  <br/>

      Well put! While some writers would try to make that voice overbearing in order to make absolutely sure it's established, they end up working against themselves as he voice turns out contrived and phony.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In Achewood, as you pointed out, the minimalism of the narration allows for the reader to 'absorb' the voice, and flesh out in his or her imagination what the narration leaves out, but hints at.

      I thought about getting involved, but then I remembered I had some kick-ass risotto in the fridge that I wanted to eat. That and it's just not that important. But what I will say is that for me (in my opinion, we're all allowed one right?) it's amusing that the Achewood RIP talk up there comes after what has been some of the strongest Achewood strips for a while. Merry xmas one and all.

      ok, so I have this problem. I think my girl's looking around, maybe cheating on me. But that could just be me being insecure. I feel like we don't talk anymore, but then what can we talk about? It's like it's all falling apart around me and I have nowhere to go. Nobody understands. I'm not exactly a 7 lemons kind of guy, but I know she doesn't need that. It used to be great, but now I just don't know. I don't even know what I want any more. Maybe nothing. Maybe I'll propose. She does the sweetest little things for me though... and it just makes me think she's acting guilty about something. She's actually not even that hot, and now maybe  <em>I'm</em>  the one looking around. Maybe she's picked up on that, and maybe that's why she's acting like she is. She calls me at work - she never used to do that! She's a good girl, probably the best - and she dotes on me. I don't deserve that. I can't even see what we have in common. I don't think I'm even attracted to her any more. <br/>

      you know i just started reading achewood a few months ago, and i read through them all one after another.  now that i'm reading them one at a time i haven't found them quite as funny.  still funny, and still my favorite comic, just not quite there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i always assumed this was because i'm only getting one at a time now, but hearing people say stuff like this makes me wonder... <br/> 
 <br/> 
i'm really not too worried about it, i will always love achewood for that period of time in which i read through the first 1200 or so... i would favorably compare the experience to that of reading most of my favorite books even... just thinking about some of the good times i've had reading this strip, well dammit: <br/>

      I think most people reading Achewood have the same experience to some degree: Reading a strip, getting hooked, racing through the archives.  So I don't know that anyone saying "this isn't as funny as it used to be" is any more or less valid than your thinking so.  By the same reasoning, we may all suffer from reading them one at a time now instead of all at once through the archives.   <br/>

      I think it is more an issue of rising expectations. With each incredible story arc, the bar is set higher and higher, until an 'average' strip becomes disappointing. It's a natural thing.

      i think to summarise my feelings on what you said, i'd like to point out the highest rated and most commented achewood strips are "Ray gets sort of stoned" and "Your porno name" respectively. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i think you're expecting a little too much from this comic, like you're entitled to 10 free IQ points onto your original score or something. on the contrary, if you notice, none of it is particularly high-brow if you know what he's referencing.

      I'm not so sure about that.  Depending on Cornelius' age he may pre-date the "Teddy" moniker which first came into use in 1902.  I may easily be wrong, and I can't seem to find the comic in question, but I sort of remember an "Achewood circa 1901" single panel strip which showed Cornelius already in college sitting in a fraternity common room.

      But even if he were to pre-date the "Teddy" moniker, over the last 100-odd years he would surely not be one to kick up a fuss about being called one.  He would accept the new terminology purely because it does not matter.  This sorta shit don't worry him.

      with regard to earlier exchange (s) about the quality of recent strips: there have been ups and downs every year,  which is just the way these things go. There's been some awesome stuff this year including the Roast Beef proposal, Todd as Belushi, Lyle the Registered Asshole, Fuck You Friday (Pat Edition)and "Comic Sans"  which I just got framed for my girlfriend! I'd call it a pretty good year and I'm getting my chuckles from the current strips, good to see Corneilis getting to run his mouth a bit more..

      I'm saddened to see Cornelius, winner of the Badass Games in such a state. That being said, I trust Onstad to make such a disgraceful portrayal of a personal hero into a workable and ultimately entertaining comic. <br/>

      There are two things which are truly horrible here, and neither is the tattoo itself.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. The first is how Cornelius must be feeling. Waking up tired, with his body aching and his head pounding like a drum, feeling worn out and dirty, not really knowing where he is, getting a barley coherent phone call, and then seeing . . . that . . . in the mirror.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. The other thing is that not only does he have a tat of Star Wars on his chest, everyone knows about it. Everyone knowns he has it. It is too late to contain the plague. It will not matter if he wears a shirt in public for the rest of his life. They know.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And #2 is what goes through his head, as he stares at himself in the mirror, with #1.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some things are two much for a man.

      Okay, this is kind of long, but stick with me.  So my friend is on tour in Europe, and he and his band are staying with some German dude who none of them really know.  One of the guitar players in the band has a Star Wars/Straight Edge tattoo (if I knew what it was I would elaborate) that is on his arm or somewhere else visible.  Their German host takes notice and compliments the tattoo, he then comments that he also has a Star Wars tattoo and asks if they'd like to see it.  They say sure and the German host stands up, turns around and lifts his shirt up, exposing on his lower back "star wars" written in some completely nondescript sans serif font maybe like six inches across, 'star' and 'wars' right next to each other, not even stacked one on top of the other.  So, Cornelius shouldn't be so upset.

      A cousin's friend has "YOU'RE NAME" on his ass cheeks. The idea being that he'd go into a bar, and make a bet with people--"I bet I have your name written on my butt." Sure enough, he would, and he'd make money. <br/>
