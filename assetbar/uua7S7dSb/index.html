      I think Ramses was on a covert operation to kick some commie butt. The method of transport happened to be "illegal gay party" flight to Havana. When a man need to be covert, it don't matter the method. Also, he says marathon ass beating, which is definitely different then marathon ass pounding.

      This week, on Venturewood: Brock and Ramses go under deep cover in Cuba to ferret out a Castro-sponsored Guild base...with sexy results.

I dunno.  On paper, a Veebs/Achewood crossover would be awesome, but it's inevitable that much would be lost in translation.  Y'know how buffet restaurants always seemed great in theory when you were younger?  Pizza, lasagna  <em>and</em>  chinese food all at once? But invariably you were disappointed: each of the elements were a pale imitation of what they tasted like at real restaurants, and the combination of all of the hollow simulacra on your plate at the same time seemed like a cruel joke.

      He was flying into Cuba to kick some commie ass, duh! <br/>

Since that's illegal, he had to hitch a ride on a gay party flight. Senator McCarthy always looked the other way, he probably was just happy to have one planeload's worth of gay people out of the country.

      I doubt this was in the McCarthy era was since I don't see Pat holding it together while sleeping with someone his father could have forseeably slept with, much less his grandfather.  Also I don't think Picnic Panic 2 came about until the early 80's at the soonest.  No I could almost see this as solo deal by Ramses, since after the cold war the guv'mint lost some interest in Commie Beating and one almost had to travel to Cuba if one wanted some Commies to beat on without leaving the hemisphere.

      Well, you might say Liberace was gay, but if you look hard enough you can find accusations of closet homosexuality against  <em>any</em>  celebrity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In all seriousness, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being 'what' and 10 being 'who do you think you're kidding', McCarthy and Lincoln are both around a 4 and J. Edgar Hoover and Cohn were 10s. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Liberace sued someone for libel in the 50s for claiming he was gay - and  <em>won</em> . The man had brass balls. (And a silicone dick, but let's not get into that today.)

      I think enough time has passed for me to step in and make sure it is clear everyone got the joke. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps I was too subtle or didn't word it correctly but basically when you first posted the following: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Basically, if you look hard enough, you can find accusations of closet homosexuality against any historical figure or celebrity.</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Everything I said in reply to this comment was an intent to lightly make fun of it. Why? Because the statement lacks substance.  It sounded like what you meant to say was: "If you look hard enough you can find  <strong>evidence</strong>  of closet homosexuality against any historical figure or celebrity." Which I take it to mean that a researcher with an agenda will seek whatever little factoids he can find and interpret them -- willfully or no -- towards the ends of aiding his or her own agenda. The fact that you said "accusations" when you first made that statement brings a level of humor to it that only the most pedantic of liberal arts students (myself) could find amusing enough to riff on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Again, I do not know for sure if I am the first to bring this to your attention or not. If I have, and you find that re-reading the thread in this context is helpful, I look forward to discussing the matter with you in a similar forum in the future. <br/>

      It may surprise you to learn that the right wing only really got a bug up its ass about homosexuality in the 80s. <br/>

As a matter of fact, it wasn't until around then that in general communism stopped being an inveterate enemy of homosexuality either. (Bourgeois perversion and all that.)

He never replied, but within a day this message appeared on the Radio page: "Some of the tracks down? Then they are probably gone forever. You should have downloaded them when you had the chance." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I, uh, I'm sorry guys.  I ruined  <em>everything.</em>

      That would be too ridiculous, since in my case it'd be some sort of indie black metal with an EBM beat. <br/>

Their costumes strongly remind me of [url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/The_Locust.jpg]The Locust[/i], but I imagine they sound much more radio-friendly. I'm guessing it's some kind of new wave or mod type of sound.

      I see Nine Inch Nails mixed with Johnny Cash, Nick Cave, and the theme from  <em>Bonanza!</em> <br/>

All heavy focus on simple driving bass rhythms, home-made electronic dirty percussion pulling out sparse beats, alcoholism, the events surrounding the poisoning of the town creek water, and possibly how Jimmy went crazy after arguably being abducted by aliens and all his friends left him and did not even visit him in hospital. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That or an industrial, country-style-melancholy version of Sublime.  Either way, the aforementioned first two elements are  <em>necessary</em>  in my book.

      Pogo, thank you. And invidious, thank you for subtly (read: blatantly) insulting my intelligence twice. And then pretending that the only reason you can't lame me is because you've already used up all your lames. I appreciate that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
See now, I do relate to Beef. And Molly for that matter. I don't mind character development at the expense of jokes...sometimes. But here...it just really feels like Sir Onstad is reaching.He's really, really trying to instill into these strips the kind of over-the-top exuberance and odd, sometimes surreal visual and literary styles he's used in the past. And the sad truth of the matter is that the man is failing himself. At this point, Achewood has almost become a parody of itself, and that is depressing. I'll still read it, and I'll still love it, but I want a return to...the humour?

      See, I do not understand this argument. If the wedding strips had not been funny, I would understand but disagree with you. But if we take a whirlwind tour through the past couple weeks we have: <br/> 
 <br/> 
- Beef's description of how he thinks the marriage is going to end (Is It A Shame) <br/> 
- Let's get married to a LADY! <br/> 
- Lie Bot's imitation of Vlad's outfit (havink such dickness) <br/> 
- Different-season Welsh sons performing physical antics for additional diversion <br/> 
- These pants are a prison. <br/> 
- etc, etc, etc <br/> 
 <br/> 
The strip with Beef's bachelor party would not at all have been out of place in 2005.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
You may not  <em>personally</em>  find many of these things funny, but it's not as if they're a radical departure from classic Achewood-style humor. The wedding arc ain't no GOF arc, but it's hitting the jokes with about the same frequency as Achewood arcs ever do, not at all abandoning them for character development. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And don't even get me started on the "fan service" allegations. As far as I can tell, they basically amount to, "When Achewood is enjoyed by others but not by me, it's fan service, and Onstad should cater to my preferences, which would somehow not count as fan service."

      I've been couching everything I say in preparation these very statements! Like I said, they are funny enough, but none are truly hysterical. More pedestrian. They just do not seem quite as inspired as they have been in the past. Actually, I'd like to make an addendum to my original statement: The reception strips have not been great. The wedding in and of itself has been a basic time of Achewood. I realize I am criticizing, like, three strips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also...fan service? Did I...okay then. Thank goodness. I was worried I had said fan service. I was worried that was me. I had a hand ready to crush my pubic bone if it was, because if I had said that I would NOT BE WORTHY OF A PUBIC BONE.

      Whatever it is, foetus has expressed some part of it.  Achewood is in a sardonic rut lately.  Characters like Ramses can be worthwhile, or they can be gross stereotypes.  Certainly these characters have crossed the line into tasteless stereotype more than once.  What is really sick however is how consistently many assetbar posters cross the line, all enthralled as they are by the exaggerated features of these characters, gushing on about these characters like so many drunken frat kids or rednecks about the exaggerated virtues of getting drunk and/or exaggerated sexist stereotypes about the female gender.  Woo hoo let's all go to a WWF "professional westling" exhibition and cheer the Ramses character.  Ya know, frankly, Onstad is completely loosing my interest there. <br/>

      Another thing I don't understand: Coming to a place where you know for sure there are a lot of people who like something, and telling them that liking that "is really sick." You're entitled to the opinion that our sense of humor and maybe also all our values are inferior to yours, but I don't know how you expect us to listen to that opinion. <br/>

Also, what exaggerated sexist stereotypes are you seeing? Because I would really love it if someone on Assetbar would take over the role of Constantly Offended by Transgressions Against Feminism. It would take a lot of lames off my hands.

that would be a typical redneck reaction, all right -- thinking that I've just called your entire way of life sick and inferior and  <em>Not listening.</em>   Because really, that is your entire way of life - your entire culture centers around slapstick humor and/or the fervent belief that your culture and belief system is completely alright and unassailable on any level. <br/>

"that would be a typical redneck reaction, all right -- thinking that I've just called your entire way of life sick and inferior and Not listening.

Like I said, they are funny enough, but none are truly hysterical. More pedestrian. They just do not seem quite as inspired as they have been in the past. Actually, I'd like to make an addendum to my original statement: The reception strips have not been great. The wedding in and of itself has been a basic time of Achewood. I realize I am criticizing, like, three strips.</em></div> <br/> 
Okay look, I know I'm slightly older than the average Assetbar denizen, and closer to "artificial hip" than "hip," but... I dunno.  Take the actual wedding strip from 7/15 ("The Math"), particularly rows four and five.  Amidst glimpses from the wedding we literally see Beef's life flash before his eyes: hanging with Ray, horrible childhood, dad's getting killed, etc.  Then he sees Molly, and has a memory of her, and... smiles.  And it made me think of my wedding, of the bright, clear Spring day on a hill in southern California, of the wildflowers and pine trees, of all the people I knew sitting there in attendence, of the nerves I had at the altar, of watching my wife come down the stairs to the meadow on the side of the hill, of that simultaneous mental flash of "wow she's beautiful/holy shit this is happening/this makes up for a lot of the shit I had to go through to get here," and the comic was an instant 5. No, it wasn't funny. But I got more out of it than most of the laughs I've had from Achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Any knucklehead can crack wise about alcohol and genitalia and bodily functions.  Achewood is awesome to me because Onstad is brilliant at reflecting (often with quite a cock-eyed viewpoint) the amazingness and absurdity of every day life (along with jokes about alcohol, genitalia, and bodily functions). To me, the dash of lunacy Onstad applies to the everyday ordinaries are far, far funnier than many of the one-liners and punchlines. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And yes, any direction Onstad decides to take this comic is fine by me.  This isn't some rookie quarterback we're talking about: I feel he has earned the benefit of the doubt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
YMMV. <br/>

      Here, invidious, take a chubby. Sorry, you seemed like an asshole before. No, sorry, I in no way made myself clear there, but what I was goin' for is that much of the wedding itself, especially that montage strip you've mentioned, were quite good, even great. But the reception was (and continued to be) fairly poor. Explanation time. <br/>

      Um...you really thought all those examples were laugh-out-loud funny? Compare any of those to "until you are SO nude," "I wouldn't let a damn MOLECULE of my dick touch you," "he rape my face, he rape my hand," or even "science fair project about scoring with gross fellows" which was the last strip I fived. The examples you give are like what I said - the characters just talking in their usual way and people cheering in recognition like they do when a popular sitcom character enters the room. Chuckle-worthy at best, and not even. As for fan service, I wouldn't use that particular phrase, but I can see what people mean. Frankly, I think the whole thing Beef getting engaged and married ruined the original dynamic of the comic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just think it's kind of a ridiculous coincidence that no matter what direction Onstad takes Achewood in, even if it's a drastically different one from previous trends, the majority of readers seem to magically be in agreement that it is a good direction, kind of how every new strip seems to be 'the best strip ever'. Are you guys ever honest with yourselves? I mean, about everything?

      Man, Elbox, I ain't got the time or finger stamina for an essay here, but I have to say. If you think the "original dynamic" of the comic was reliant on the suffering and loneliness of Roast Beef, or indeed the situation of any single character, I don't think you're reading it the way it should be read. Achewood isn't a good comic because it features a cat who is too sad to bite through toast. It's a great comic because of Onstand's amazing skill in writing and characterisation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Moreover, I have to kind of read your post as saying that you'd rather that Beef had never got married, as it's too large a deviation from the classic Achewood of your youth. And yeah, sure, other webcomics can survive with the same characters in the same situations for years on end, and still churn out hilarious and original punchlines every week. But no way that'd work for Achewood. Achewood is too deep a piece of work, and Onstead is too good a writer. They couldn't function without character development and changes in situation, and not only to give him new means through which to express his genius, but also because change is a necessary facet of life, and despite being about a bunch of talking cats and some alive stuffed animals, Achewood is, in its characters and dialogue, inherently lifelike.

      Personally, I felt a pang of trouble when Beef proposed, feeling that the options from there were him getting married, and taking Beef's character developement into an area that might not be the most comfortable, or the marriage somehow imploding on itself, setting a horribly numbing status quo, or perhaps worse still, having the engagement be in static developement indefinately. I am thinking at the moment that this is the braver of the three, and am willing to see where it goes from there. <br/> 
The strips are not awful, I still find myself curious and anticipating, they do not yet feel phoned in, but that is just my opinion.

      I find the things I listed significantly funnier than the "scoring with gross fellows" joke. In fact, I find them funnier than The Mountain and the Motorcycle, which is the third highest-rated strip ever. I guess it is time for me to start telling everyone who liked that strip they have an incorrect sense of humor.

I'm with you on the fact that this isn't really less funny than historical strips.  I think the mounding of characters into a small space is best appreciated by longtime fans, but that's hardly fan service.  The current stuff is a mash of funny and weird, as all of Achewood has been.  It's not his best, not his worst, just trying something different.  I'm always most impressed with Achewood when Eisenstad tries new things.

      Hey achilleselbow? We are sort of on the same side here. But screw you. To begin with, the straight-forward natures of these characters allows us to invest ourselves moreso than in some complex, ever-changing, deep human. For example, the characters of Dostyevsky (namedrop) or Kafka (namedrop). And beyond that, the fact that you believe that no webcomic could ever top the works of the great authors of the past, then you are simply being a bit foolish. Those authors were great for their times, and they reflected their times admirably. Onstad is great for his time, and he reflects his time admirably in all ways, including through his chosen medium. To tell you the truth...I would have to say I feel sorry for you. Oh wait, that's condescending.

      Yea I mean, there's not much in it in the way of laughs. Everyone's fiving it just because it's a big event that they've been waiting for. I really don't get the whole thing of being attached to the characters just for their sake. I mean I've admired Onstad's writing and his use of language as much as anyone, but I've never forgotten that the original point of Achewood was that the characters and their quirks were there to be  <em>funny</em> . At this point, however, people seem to go wild just because a character makes an appearance and acts in his trademark way, just the way the studio audience hoots and hollers whenever Kramer walks in before he's even said or done anything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe it's just me, but I thought Beef was a lot funnier when he was so ridiculously depressed that he wanted to fly to the moon and stay there or couldn't walk into a store than when he's freaking out about the food at his wedding. I guess Achewood's transformation from absurdist humor to a focus on characters and continuity has been happening since almost the very beginning with The Party, but I thought it reached a happy medium somewhere around the Beef Makeover and Cartilage Head arcs. At this point, I wonder how many people's primary motivation for reading is to find out what's going to happen to the characters in the next strip, and we all know what that's like.

      Pretty much what I was thinking.  It's not that this arc hasn't been entertaining, it's just not  <em>as</em>  fun or interesting for those of us who aren't all that attached to the characters.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 I can't relate to Roast Beef at all, so seeing him succeed isn't doing the same thing for me as it does for people who see a bit of themselves in the dude.  I don't want to take the attachment or comradarie away from anybody else, but I'd really like to see in the next arc, something a bit more...joke-centered, not so character driven.  Like the Lyle vomits on a football strip, which, probably will be about what happens when the wedding is all finished. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Both are fine, but the pendulum needs to swing back a bit, I feel.

      Looking back at this arc, my favorite parts have been the strips involving Ramses or Molly's family.  While the main characters were stepping through rituals as old as time itself--Molly and Beef getting married, Ray pining for his father's acceptance, Teodor aspiring to create but falling short--we got to see some amusing expansion of the Ramses character, plus some comedic relief from the undead Welsh clan.  That's the best of both worlds, I suppose: let the supporting characters deliver the comedy while the protagonists fulfill their various destinies.

      He is going well out of his way to babble about bits and pieces of his life to total strangers using flimsy pretenses, just so that we get to see him in further comic strips.

      Hmmmm cocaine for breakfast, I know song about that... <br/> 
 <em>Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds<br/>
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down<br/>
I went right home and I went to bed<br/>
I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head<br/>
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun<br/>
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run<br/>
Made a good run but I run too slow<br/>
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico<br/>
Late in the hot joints takin' the pills<br/>
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill<br/>
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown<br/>
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down<br/>
Said yes oh yes my name is Willy Lee<br/>
If you've got the warrant just read it to me<br/>
Shot her down because she made me sore<br/>
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more<br/>
When I was arrested I was dressed in black<br/>
They put me on a train and they took me back<br/>
Had no friend for to go my bail<br/>
They slapped my dried up carcass in that country jail<br/>
Early next mornin' bout a half past nine <br/>
I spied the sheriff coming down the line<br/>
Ah and he coughed as he cleared his throat<br/>
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court<br/>
Into the courtroom my trial began<br/>
Where I was handled by twelve honest men<br/>
Just before the jury started out<br/>
I saw the little judge commence to look about<br/>
In about five minutes in walked the man<br/>
Holding the verdict in his right hand<br/>
The verdict read in the first degree <br/>
I hollered Lordy Lordy have a mercy on me<br/>
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen <br/>
99 years in the Folsom pen<br/>
99 years underneath that ground <br/>
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down<br/>
Come on you've gotta listen unto me <br/>
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be</em>

Maybe that's the point. Maybe Onstad is trying to do some deconstruction here, you know? Yeah, he's a legend, yeah, everyone thinks he's a badass, but maybe he actually isn't.

      I'm totally with you Okie-brother.  I got the sense that Ramses was always more about the distant-father archetype, and not the invincible badass.  Most of the unstoppable asskicker image has come from people on this board.  I got the sense that much of his awesome in the comic was filtered through Ray's need for a hero-figure, which naturally fell to his missing father.  My take on the current 'normalcy' of Ramses is to show that he really is just some guy who fights well, and spreads his seed throughout the land, and really is a normal guy.  The myth of the king of assbeaters really never was in the comic for me.

      I take your point, but what about him blowing the top off of the beer bottle in the last strip? Seemed to me that Onstad felt the need to re-affirm Ramses' badass credentials just then. And surely the easiest way to make him more mundane is to have a bloo-bloo weepy scene with Ray. I get the feeling that it's meant to be like the end of the GOF, with the badass heading off into the sunset.

      Why did Onstad put him blowing the bottle cap off when he did?  He did it to show Ray seeing it.  It inflates the 'amazing dad' image in Ray's mind.  When Ray wasn't looking, he talked about doing Yoga, having a bad back, farting a lot and not being able to ask some women out.  Pretty standard older guy stuff (right Pogo?).  He was even kinda pushy with Pat (who was being a dick, but the wise thing is to just ignore him).  I don't think the bottle-based coolness was for us, I think it was to keep Ray going.

      Or, hell, the police blotter article with him in it? I guess you could be right - I'd prefer it if you were - but it looks more to me like Chris is floundering to keep him 'raw' while at the same time totally breaking down everything we know about him by making him a central character. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Either way, I still see dozens of people singing about how bad the guy is despite him clearly acting like an attention starved old codger all through this arc, so I guess we'll need stronger stuff to break through all this steel-willed suspension of disbelief.

      Thank you, tekende; I'm glad I read down a little further before posting that redundantly.   <br/>

Personally, I'm all for killing the legend, if softly, if it stops people from always saying shit like "...because HE KICKS MENS' ASSES AND HE VOTES!" or coming up with new excuses for why every fucking thing Ramses does is badass; it's so tired.  The guy could have pink ribbons tied to his pubes and someone on here would spin it into a  <em>raison d'etre</em>  for the male gender.

      It's validating to see other people feel the same way. Achewood still has some absurd elements about it, but it has become more character driven (and not interesting characters either, but Roast Beef, the cat that sucks). The new premium content thing reflects that as well. I was happier when the character blogs, or Ray's mailbox (really bummed this isn't around any more) were the character development and the strips were just ridiculous and off the wall. The Dr. John Woharbus strip was the last one that felt like old-style achewood to me, and it's a travesty that the wedding strip is rated higher than the motorcycle strip or Ray getting stoned.

      It must be tough being an Eyeball Man, though.  Women always complaining, "Stop looking me in the eyes, you perv!"  Plus the unimaginable feeling of shame when your wife comes home early and catches you sniffing her spare contact lenses.  I do not envy Eyeball Men.

      The radiator is just letting off a bit of steam. That is because a highly tuned engine actually runs at a higher temperature than a standard factory engine. Standard they keep it below boiling, but a "hot" engine often will run at plus 100 degrees Celsius with pressure stopping the coolant from creating water vapor. The resultant pressure cooker will often leak a little pressure through the radiator cap.

      Ramses just keeps getting more and more interesting. <br/>

Also I couldn't stop laughing when I saw the Ten Men skritching past. I can't imagine their movements without applying some kind of weird sound effect; they're too bizarre to be silent like this. <br/>

They're kind of like that group of evil alley cats in that movie Gay Puree in that they travel in a collective and are mostly indistinguishable from each other besides their instruments.

      What the hell, people? <br/>

Is there something wrong with me that I don't understand what's going on? <br/> 
 <br/> 
How can we tell that it's the Tenmen turning up?  It makes perfect sense to me that it's the Tenmen, but I don't see a definitive clue that tells me it's them.  Have I gotten too old and unhip to recognize this?  Is it possible that we two, you and I, have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute "a joke"? <br/> 
 <br/> 
And what is with all these avatars?  What is that about?  Is it some kind of secret code from an agent, like one who was sent to spy on a Cuban talent show?  All saying "Situation compromised, send RLS to get me out, baby baby make me loco, baby baby make me mambo?"

      Okay.  I went back and doublechecked.  This time I saw the Tenmen skritchin' past.  Somehow I missed that first time out, possibly 'cos of the power of the Rameses/Rod dynamic or possibly 'cos I was a bit puzzled on PBR's after a long afternoon filming (Hell Kittens from Rottweiler Productions, soon to be coming to a very minor theatre near you, look it up). <br/>

      It's strange that people are thinking that Onstad is losing his touch here. I love that he is developing Ramses characters in such an odd (and often deliberately pedestrian) fashion. It may not be moving quickly but it's a great way to undermine the archetypes that almost all the characters are based on (including Ramses). These are subtle turns and subtle times for the development of what Achewood is...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
and quite frankly "I'll make love to your face" is the perfect example that when you ain't lookin' Onstad will drop back into the characteristic writing that a lot of you seem so hungry for.

      His use of subtlety in this fashion is....bah I'm too tired.  Well said.

      I like that undermining, too! Who was expecting Ramses to find mid-melee comfort in the remembrance of gay porn? Nobody except a little friend I like to call  <em>Nobody</em> .
