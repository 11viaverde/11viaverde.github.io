      Sometimes I sit outside in the cool of the evening, looking at the stars - a moth flutters around the night light. The drone of the cicadas only amplify the silence. Sometimes, I like to imagine that asherdan is still among us, as a ghost, writing interesting comments with a fresh user account.

      Look, I apologize in advance for getting a little bit "internet message board poster" about this, but here's the thing: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dude's first day here, he tries to call somebody out for being "indulgent and pointless and unnecessary." That's all well and good, and you can use chubbies and lames to express how you feel about comments. Many of manflesh's only rate about a 50/50 anyway . . we get it, porno slasher fan fic isn't hilarious to everybody. <br/> 
But when a couple people tell him that it's kind of a running joke and not to be hatin' just yet, he just got all lame-happy on them. And that's sometimes when I start calling people names. <br/>

      Ya, cool, I just learned that last week, because people call Adam Wainwright (a pitcher for the Cardinals) (a baseball team in St. Louis) (which is in Missouri) (in the U.S.A.) the "wagonmaker," and I had to find out why.  Now this.  My god.  Things are really connecting for me and the wagons lately.  I gotta go call Radio Flyer about some lotto tickets.

      heh. It's funny when people say "neat." <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you have read the past two days' comics and the accompanying comments, you might get why it's "funny or neat." If you haven't, you probably won't.  <br/> 
I'm at a loss to explain  <em>why</em>  it is funny, exactly, but it is. I think it's kind of a "you just get it or you don't" thing. Either way, best not to worry about it. You can always add Dr. Manflesh to your ignore list.

      I know, I've always liked "neat" for some reason. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the record, I  <em>have</em>  read the past few days' comics (and the past several years') but I still just think this is lame.  But you're right, and I'm not exactly worrying about it.  Just confused.  It seems like people are giving it too much credit for being this Andy Kaufman-esque comedy bit, but for me it's just not reading as clever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suppose there's lots of stuff that I find really funny and other people don't.  Tim and Eric springs to mind as a good example.

      I won't lame that, but I will declare that, in my opinion, your decision to change your avatar thoroughly reeks of lameness. Never mind that you've kept up the Ash theme.

      It was only momentary, it was quickly changed to this current one.  I may change it back, I'm not sure.  One has to experiment - but does that negate the possibility to change back without becoming even MORE lame?  That is the artistic question.

      Well, I'm gonna stick with my own avatar. As I have said, I don't like change. But a piece of advice; I would have to imagine that the Don Hertzfeldt avatar is bound to garner you no end of cred with these fake internet message board types (myself included). And so ends my involvement with this "musical avatars" mania.

      Oh necessarily it would.  But whatever - I have trouble making such decisions, but am not doing so for the case of looking cool via association with a product I know little about.  People would be all "oh Hertzfeldt he was cooler before blah blah blah" and I would have no idea what they were talking about as I only saw his set of cartoons once on a mate's computer.  I just found that gif and thought it was awesome.  That particular  <em>Fight Club</em>  avatar, however, I feel has multiple associations from that particular scene which I felt as applicable to myself.  <br/>

      One must always fight stagnancy. To be identified with something all the time is to limit what you can do.  <br/>

I really should precede that with a "Confucius say" or something. It's like I ripped that shit right from a fortune cookie or maybe a fourth grade inspirational poster.  <br/>

      I didn't have a cement bridge. I had an overpass by a stretch of highway mostly unused.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was fun to go back there, like sneaking off into a cave, some little crack in the surface of the world that everyone had forgotten about. I can still remember the sigh of cars and musty smell of dark water, the mutter and cry of swallows nesting far up in its rafters, the sting of a cigarette we had snuck from my mother's purse... Drinking a forty we had paid some college kid to buy us and trying to hide the grimace that followed each sour swig. It was like you could take some little part of yourself that was always vulnerable and hide it away where no one could find it and on lazy afternoons you'd pedal across fields and baking cement and then there you'd be, all tucked away in the far back like you had never left there at all.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was a good place. It felt safe. It felt like no matter what happened in the rest of your life, that little corner of the world would always be there and be just the same, spray paint scrawls winding across its surface, the septic glint of broken beer bottles, the slow crawl of water running down stained cement... Things like that didn't seem to end. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wonder what it'd be like to go back there. Doesn't matter, I guess. It's probably torn down by now. But that seems to be the way of things.

She went back to it when she was an adult.  It was the height of her hip and tarnished yellow.  She climbed over the top of it, got bored, and went home. <br/>

in my mind, i was invited. there was much crispy stellas by the pool. Beef and Molly nowhere to be seen. (something about a boat.) i became involved in a conversation with Tèodor about vinyl. as he gabbed i noticed Philippe in a reporter's hat on the terrace, talking to Lie Bot. as a breeze drifted under the bridge and ruffled my hair, i knew that this was a Good party. <br/>

      I felt and thought a great many things when I read this one, so lemme do them all at once: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. Teodor mirrors my sentiments on sex exactly, although I can't say I've ever had that happening to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. That's probably the saddest story Roast Beef ever told about his childhood, and that's saying a lot. His mom did some crappy things to him and Showbiz, but I don't think any of the other stories resulted in near-death experiences. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. "Cartooning" could've been a comic in itself and I'd have 5'ed it. <br/>

4. Who's this 'Franklin Christensen Ware' fella?

      Oh yeah, because Onstad  <em>never</em>  uses the same images over and over again. *cough Bigfoot walk cough* <br/>

Dude, he probably only has like 15 images of each character that he re-uses for each comic.  He might draw something new when it's needed (see Great Outdoor Fight), but he clearly cut-and-pastes stuff he drew ages ago a LOT. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's just the dialogue that's different - and that's what I'm here for anyway.  I'm not complaining, it's just the way it is.  Still, I'm prepared for a lame-fest.

      I believe now the preferred term is "antisocial personality disorder." Very different from "unsocial."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unsocial means you have youporn.com in your bookmarks in your browser along with several high-ranking characters in a range of RPGs.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Antisocial means you shot a family of three because the father wouldn't let you in on the freeway. It means you are incapable of accepting any social law because you fundamentally cannot believe the basic tenet of any society, that other people are just as important than you and you have no right to harm them and no right to their stereos and wives.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Exactly who is accepted as members of a society is a pretty big problem for a lot of people, and it's not something I'm going to tackle on a cartoon web board.

      agreed, i think it's because we know these characters, we see them as if they are actual people and something like this that just expands on situations we already know about them makes it something special. Maybe, maybe it's just jackin off into the old poop catcher.

      That is one of the things I like the most about Achewood, actually. It's a comic about cats, stuffed animals, robots, et al., and it deals in toilet humour, but it's also incredibly solid from an artistic standpoint. It's a lot harder to be both clever and lowbrow than it is to be just clever. Seriously, this shit is Quality.

      On the contrary, I've read multiple mentions of Berkeley Breathed and Bill Watterson. It's also fairly obvious - though never actually mentioned by him - that George Herriman should be recognized as rather important to the outcome of his strips. Though, I guess that could be said of anything of any worth that succeeded it.

      I get the feeling you're trying to capture Beef's voice, but you're not really doing it very well. He's a man of few words, usually - you need to keep your sentences lean and concise until you build up steam to get rolling. Also, RBK does not object to full stops, he uses them on his blog all the time.

      this is one of the few efforts by Onstad that, despite being majorly incomprehensible, stands up to his god-among-men-like works of "ray is sort of stoned" and "phillipe makes a bad choice", as well as the blogs for Nice Pete.

      I'm struggling with the definition of "Art Fag". <br/> 
 <br/> 
If he is a Fag, he must therefore be eschewing intimate relations with the opposite sex for those of his own.  If in this circumstance, the same sex of his is that of Art, what is the opposite? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm guessing it's video games. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The irony here is two-fold: <br/> 
1. Those who are "art fags" probably get more chicks than those who sit and play Rainbow Six all fucking night, and are less annoying. <br/> 
 <br/> 
and B: The most likely next medium of art is video games.  Think games like Fahrenheit, Shadow of the Colossus, Okami, etc.  Of course, it won't be considered "art" while it's still the popular medium of entertainment.  Mark Twain had a similar problem.

      Well, it's a damn good thing you didn't say it then. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Meanwhile, I know exactly what you mean.  Our society comes from a society wherein you respect and trust people in authority who tell us stuff, and so it's ingrained into our brain patterns to do so. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But in the society that has developed, the authority is the media - which, realistically, we shouldn't trust and respect nearly as much as we do, hence the "Cult of Celebrity" that's around nowadays.  And now, the common media is the internet, and any old dipshit (eg, DrSkradley) can become the Voice of Authority.  I fail to count the amount of times I met someone from a band or talked to someone who made a video of a flash animation on the net, and got a giddy because it was like talking to somebody famous.  "Whoa, I got an email back from Chris of Dr. McNinja!  He totally wrote stuff, it wasn't just an automated response!  I'm so special!" "Whoa! The guy from Metroid Metal was willing to chat about music via email! That's so awesome!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
When, really, everybody's the same and nobody should be telling us what's right for our life.  Weird thing to get our heads around, when we have generations and generations of conditioning to tell us otherwise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Okay I'll stop now.  It's a one of many pet topics of mine that I like to rant on.  Sorry for blogging, Acheworld.  If I must wear the Scarlet Letter of "B" for the rest of my days, I will suffer it for the sake of our unspoilt community.

      Actually, a true Ware parody would have the spermatozoa travel crosswise through the panels, through  a tube that widened into a circular, multi-generational vignette every 1.5 inches before it ended up in the toilet. There would also be a small unrelated strip at the bottom that hammers home the futility of human aspirations and the emotional mendacity required for the simplest of relationships, and the point would be made with stylized bees.  <br/> <br/> <br/> Just kidding.

      I too have a cement bridge. Many of my most wonderful and tragic memories took place there. I remember I took a walk there with my first lover and I fellated him with much fervor, more fervor than Orpheus for Euridice, more fervor than Hero for Leander. His cum tasted like molten pina colada, for my lover ate many a tropical fruit. It was so delightfully tropical that I was overcome and accidentally spat upon his Calvin Klein bootcut denims. He looked upon me with so much disgust that I turned and ran toward my candy apple red Vespa and panicking, made several indents around the car lock with my keys in my hurry to leave. I looked back at my lover in the rear view mirror and knew, as his Dodge Ram drove off in the opposite direction, that our paths would never cross again.

      I was led to believe I shouldn't need to explain this, but, seeing as how I'm clearly misunderstood, here goes: <br/> 
I wasn't grousing about being old. In fact, quite the opposite, I found it funny that, albeit being extremely young, my reaction was that of a sixty-year-old. I thought it was amusing, but, since it was SO offensive to you, I retract from my statement. I'm really sorry, biff, it won't happen again.

      My biggest problem with the internet is people taking me seriously when I am being facetious, and people assuming I am being facetious when I am deadly serious. <br/>

Wait.  That happens to me all the world too. <br/>

I wasn't offended.  My reaction was intended to be  <em>comedy</em> . <br/>

      My favorite band these days is prolly  <em>Talking Heads</em> .  Although, if you can't find a very large piece of driftwood  <em>Yes</em>  would be good too.  You can leave the driftwood on my front porch, since I probably have choir practice that night. <br/>

      It seems like people have always gotten lamed for both of those things. And as far as the general temperature of this online community, well, I think any hope for true civilization went out the window when the average number of comments went from, like, twenty to, like, five hundred. It goes back to all that  <em>Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft</em>  shit which I've tried so hard to forget since my brief stint in higher education. College algebra? Well, that was gone before the class even ended. But for some reason the sociological residue remains. Probably because German words are more fun to remember than those nightmarish polynomials.
