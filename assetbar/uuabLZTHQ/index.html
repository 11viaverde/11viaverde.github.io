      I agree that that one  <em>has</em>  more chubbies, but it doesn't  <em>give</em>  as many. <br/>

      Related issue/suggestion: there should be most chubbied lists for each individual user (i.e., a way to sort a particular user's comments by number of chubbies). <br/>

      This arc is just dragging terribly. I can barely be bothered to pay attention any more. Finally I think I understand where everyone else was coming from with the Polly arc. This is just... I have to say it's the first time where I feel like Onstad has just seriously dropped the ball. <br/>

On the plus side we got a new strip out of the blue and not long after the last one. A really great job and without any deadline provided or missed.

      In what way would you compare him to Kricfalusi? Would it have something to do with producing something unbelievably good for a long time and then suddenly falling off the face of the earth? I'm not saying I'd agree with that, just trying to clarify.

      Kricfalusi has been sort of back occasionally, off and on, recently. Plus he only did season one before getting fired so I wouldn't say it was really a long time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was more along the lines of producing something incredible, but being almost entirely incapable of doing so in a timely manner. <br/>

In all fairness Onstad also doesn't give us wickedly hot women or  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110609025051/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO1-bSIibgQ">shower scenes of almost comedic gratuity</a> .

      When you drink everyday, St. Paddy's loses its novelty. Not to mention that all the bars fill up with the worst kind of bar-goers of all: novices. And my job strangely doesn't grant the morning after St. Paddy's off, so even the prospect of drinking  <em>even more</em>  than usual loses its sheen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I sound like a downer. I'm actually in a really good mood. <br/>

      "Stout majority."  I get it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've become tired of going out to bars on the 17th; around where I live, any place that has Guinness on tap (which is most places) is just balls to the wall packed, with a few token, really annoying plastic paddies running around spilling other peoples' beers.  If someone is having a party, I'll go, but my one friend who normally has one, well, isn't having one this year. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personally, I'm probably just gonna pick up something liquid and Irish on the way home (resisting the temptation to get some Redbreast), listen to the Pogues, and watch the Quiet Man or Man of Aran or something.

I think now that all holidays should be about trying new things and having fun, regardless of authenticity. After all, on a long enough time span nothing is authentic and everything is just a bunch of shit someone just recently made up.

      Well I know I'm not Irish-Irish, but heritage has always been pretty important in my family.  If it doesn't count for shit to you unless I speak Gaelic fluently and have relatives in the IRA, then I could care less, but I don't feel hypocritical or like I'm lying when I say being Irish is important to me.

      there's nothing to debate here, this isn't even really news. <br/> 
the catholic church is against birth control of any sort, always. they want you to wait until your married. it's kind of their thing. <br/> 
however that title seemed a little negative, but i've been noticing a lot of catholic hate lately, which i don't understand. yes, the new pope is really conservative, and he apparently is unable to appear in the media without seeming offensive. basically, he is not john paul. from what i've read, he reinstated those bishops, including the one who is a holocaust denier (btw not what he got excommunicated for) in order to avoid another schism within the church. you could compare the catholic church with the troubles the newspaper industry is facing -- people are having to decide between tradition and adapting to meet the current needs. <br/> 
the church has made a lot of progress, all things considered. they didn't even stop doing latin mass and chapel veils until the 60s. a lot of people don't know that, despite being against gay marriage, the catholic church is accepting of homosexuality, so long as they abstain.  <br/> 
i may have achieved a point somewhere in here, but hopefully you at least learned some fun facts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
bonus: st. patrick's day is totally a holy day of obligation in ireland. basically, you're required to go to mass. it's a Thing. also, i always forget that st. patrick supposedly was not from ireland, but wales.  <br/> 
another bonus fact: mary of magdalene was not a whore, the catholic church took that back forever ago. somehow people still think it. she's actually a saint :)

      Not really hate of Catholics. Possibly hate of Catholicism. Had a long argument with my girl about it. In essence it's a system that denies gay sexuality, denies human sexuality (condoms/priest sex/abortion), and has constantly covered up child sex abuse. I just believe it's an archaic system of a bygone time.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are many systems with inherent flaws, I think Catholicism has more than most. In the end though, it's your moral code and I ain't got no power over that. Everyone is a part of some system that's fucked up.

      also, i've never seen a catholic attempt to convert anyone, and while yeah a collection basket goes round, a lot of baptist churches expect congregation members to put in a certain percent of their wages. also at every catholic festival ever, there will be a beer tent. plus there's just something about the whole process of mass and everything, i can't explain really the appeal of the ritual and formality of the whole thing. this being said, i rarely go to church. <br/> 
i'm rambling a lot on this, but basically i think the catholic church just needs new pr and advertising people. time to get with the times.  <br/>

oh for another inherently flawed and entertaining system, check out the Shakers. They didn't believe in procreation. <br/>

ramble prequel synopsis: <br/> 
being catholic makes my being white a little more interesting, i like to think. definitely moreso than explaining the ridiculous pie chart that makes up my family background. <br/> 
catholicism, like any religion, ever, gives you something to believe in. <br/> 
we're not going to get it right anytime soon, but neither is anyone else. it's kind of a panacea until another religion succeeds, which i guess is bound to happen sometime or another, seeing as there were many religions before christianity that aren't around anymore. <br/> 
but yes i'm going to stop talking about catholicism. it's a weird issue, i'm sure i'm not the only cradle catholic like this, but despite not really believing in jeebus and all that, i will totally not eat meat on fridays during lent. somehow, i bet that sums up a lot of people. someone else figure it out.

      I'm Catholic but I haven't been to Church since confirmation and haven't given up anything for Lent in two years.  I consider more a part of my background than my religion, which is odd, I know, but Catholicism is a big thing for my family (need I remind you: Irish, Italian, Mexican) and I think it's something that shaped my family, but for me just isn't something I want to be a part of anymore religiously.

      Holy Christ no.  Race isn't a social construct, it is physical, genetic.  Ethnicity is a social construct.  And to be considered a part of an ethnic group, you have to consider yourself and others have to consider you part of it.  So, just like Jewish is kinda an ethnic group (although apparently you don't have to follow the religion, whch is confusing), I suppose that Catholicism can be considered an ethnic group as well . ..except that it isn't very noticable.  It's not a very tight-knit ommunity, culture-wise.  While Rastas have dreadlocks, and smoke ganja, and have their own lingo, etc, Catholic culture is too diluted, mixed in with all of western culture.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, the idea of someone saying "I'm one half white and one half Catholic" is ridiculous.

      no no, race really is a social construct. there are more genetic differences between dna samples of one race than the are between different races. society defined race, which is different from ethnicity, which is when groups with similiar beliefs, history and culture identify with each other, despite possible racial differences. <br/> 
yeah it would actually be difficult to start doing, and catholicism in different everywhere its practiced. i think it would be an interesting marketing move for the catholic church. <br/> 
 <br/> 
but yeah race isn't real. there is no science to it.

      I knew that race is not recognized or whatever by anthropology, and that there is more difference within than between. <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>The American Anthropological Association%u2019s statement on race states: %u201Cphysical variations in the human species have no meaning except the social ones that humans put on them.%u201D</em></div> <br/> 
So yeah, it is a social construct, my mistake.  I got confused about terms. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But my point is that race is still a physical thing, not social differences.  I have never heard the term "society-defined race" and I would appreciate a source on that.  I am confused by the contradiction between the name of the term and the "despite racial differences" part.  If someone says "Oh, well Jewish is a race because it is "society-defined" which means that even though it isn't physical it is still a race" just strikes me as an excuse to use the term "racism" more broadly, when the term "ethnocentrism" is the correct academic term.  Of course, people won't ever say that while just talking with friends, but we are talking about what the scholars use.  Race is physical.  And to suggest that Catholics are a race is just . .. it just makes me a little sick, for reasons I can't articulate.  I think catholicism should whither and die a painful death.  alling it a race suggests that people are born being catholic.  People are not born being catholic.  They are taught to be catholic.

I don't understand how one religion has to succeed.  I guess it depends on how you define it.  If you define it as supernaturalism, then that is definitely wrong, as I believe it doesn't exist.  If you define it as . . .I don't know. . .a series of beliefs(supernatural or not) that inform you what is the correct way to life, I don't really believe that either.  If you call people believing in the Big Bang, and no afterlife of any sort, and thinking all morals are subjunctive, etc . . .not everyone is going to accept that, even if the governemtn and the majority of people do.

      oops i got misunderstood. i was vaguely hypothesizing about the next religion that's going to come along. remember that christianity is basically the world's most successful cult. but now we have all kinds of different social media, <br/> 
i totally in no way meant one religion had to succeed. i think i meant supersede, but its amazing everything i wrote on so little sleep isn't riddled with errors. <br/> 
but yeah totally all about some religious freedoms. there's no real way to do christianity correct. that is not a thing you can do. everyone's using a telephone game of a bible, and no one is really told how the bible was put together by a committee. there's corruption and all kinds of misunderstandings in every aspect of christianity. people are human and will always do bad things and will always need scapegoats. i only speak of christianity because i don't know much about other religions.

      I dislike the notion of Elvis fanatics, I don't know why...might be because...of a distant memory... <br/> 
 <br/> 
As a young lad, growing up in the southwest of County Queens, lower New York state, my mother, in the particular habit of trying to be as sociable as possible in a place where the opportunity rarely reared its head, would take along my sister and I to a neighbor's house, down the street apiece, to gossip gaily with an older friend "affectionately" known as Rose (affection barely entered into it from my perspective), leaving us to entertain her young granddaughter, a demonchild if there ever was one named Samantha.  In addition to the carcinogenic sauna that was the lower level of this house (this particular neighborhood given to the odd distinction of having many houses below street level due to latter day sewer renovations, adding upper levels that served as street-level "second floors"), we had to suffer with the maniacal child and her ornery, Elvis-obsessed grandfather, a more callous man I never knew.  Convinced we were the demon children instead (possibly due to our distinctly olive-toned skin, perhaps on a good day passing for Sicilians), he sought to make even our persevering, good humored and mature attempts at entertaining his insane granddaughter a course of hoops and hurdles to work through.  A more miserable man you will never find but O! how he loved his Elvis memorabilia, and the man himself-- nothing gave him greater joy.  In this crotchety, subterranean life, he carved out one piece of happiness in the memory of a dead pop icon and in my youth I despised it as an extension of him.  To this day, I rue the Elvis-is-alivers and fanatics, perhaps trying to reject the memory of this corpulent, dirty old man, sitting on his cigarette-burnt couch, watching TV and grunting orders at my sister and I... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fuck life stories amirite.

      I'm with Tekende on this one. A great premise and interesting script killed by terrible pacing and surprisingly hit-and-miss acting (for which I will blame the director). It's a shame. I'm sure another creative team could've made it work. Imagine a Terry Gilliam version.

      Terry Gilliam would have done an ok job, I just don't think it's a movie that would deserve the Gilliam treatment. <br/>

Imagine a Gilliam Watchmen though. It would not be good. Probably even worse than what we had now (because it was rumored he wanted to end it with Dr. Manhattan saving the world). <br/>

      I believe that almost all of the mentions are directly due to TGH. Nothing against it, but comic fandom isn't measured in number of times you reference a major film adaptation of a widely read graphic novel.

      I'm implying that it's been a long time (~20 years) since he's made anything I would want to watch a 2nd time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Admittedly, I've never had much interest in seeing two overrated actors in a movie by a fanboy-bait director by a writer I've never really cared about, so I haven't seen Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas.  Its generally mixed reviews, by critics and fans alike, haven't swayed me to think otherwise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I get tired of Gilliam fanboys who can't accept the fact that Gilliam's been travelling on the road of the smug, creative has-been for years now.  His nerd-charm and cred are big enough that even  <em>I</em>  still want the guy to get back on the creative wagon one of these days, but I'll be damned if I didn't get sick of the guys about ten years ago.  Maybe he  <em>should</em>  let Hollywood intervene in more of his movies, just to try something new...nothing else is working. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the legions of Gilliam fans don't help.  If a Terry Gilliam movie is your favorite movie, then you need to see more movies.  Maybe I've just met too many nerds who'll grandstand and pontificate on how Brazil is the best movie ever made, and then turn out to know jack all about movies that don't know have slow motion shoot-outs in them.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hate to pigeonhole, but it seems that everyone I've met who likes to pretend they know about film but really don't tend to be big Terry Gilliam fans.

      I don't "like" to "pretend" to "know" about "film," but  <em>Twelve Monkeys</em>  and  <em>Fear and Loathing</em>  (to speak only of the past twenty years) were both amazing. You know, prolificacy isn't everything. Terrence Malick has made, like, four movies over the last forty years, all of which have been excellent.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And shame on you for undercutting the accomplishments of Johnny Depp. Whether or not you get tired of seeing his pretty face, it is patently shortsighted to deny that he is one of the most versatile actors of our time.

      while i love fear and loathing and think its the best adaptation of hunter s. thompson's work, fact is that  every kid who thinks drugs are the height of cool loves that movie. for those unfamiliar, the percent of douchebags and functional morons in the population of recreational drug users is ridiculously large. these are the people who are disappointed by Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail and don't attempt to read much more of his work. <br/> 
basically, with a little bit of elitism, you can ruin anything for yourself.

      I never said anything about being prolific or not.  I just put an estimate on how long it's been since he made a movie I liked.  I'm fine with slow movers (and yeah, I'm a Malick fan, too). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can't stand the love-fest for Depp, damn.  He's better than average, and really enjoyable in certain movies.  I give the guy credit for trying to avoid the typical pretty boy roles all the time, and actually giving a shit about acting.  I've argued this with friends before; maybe he is one of the better actors of the current times.  That is not a good statement about the current times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also didn't find 12 Monkeys amazing.  I'd rather watch La Jetee and not have to put up with Brad Pitt's  <em>ACTING</em> .  In fact, watching the "original" makes you realize how annoying Gilliam's convoluted style can be.  He took something incredibly soulful and injected that dork energy into it. <br/>

If it makes it any better, there was a time once when I thought that Gilliam was one of the great directors.   <br/>

      That's funny, I don't see me saying that anywhere.  If you're saying that because I said I disagree with Terry Gilliam fans, than your assumption makes no sense (attaching the word "popular" to anything having to do with Terry Gilliam fans is ridiculous). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Way to take the easy way out, tekende.  Nothing like breaking out the "I'll just call him a hipster/elitist" technique, that obviously settles it all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Frankly, it's a lot more fucking hip to be a Gilliam apologist.  I should point out that I'm not entirely kicking against the pricks here; even the All Movie Guide has only given the guy one 4  star movie since Brazil (it was 12 Monkeys). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, and I'm 3 martinis in here, saying that Terry Gilliam is one of the greatest directors is like saying that J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the greatest writers.

It's just the spelled-out version of saying somebody is an elitist/hipster, as these terms are basically interchangable when used in these kind of discussions.  I was a little disheartened.  I don't mind arguing, even throwing and taking a few barbs back and forth.  But don't just pin down my opinion on Gilliam to being an elitist and/or hipster. <br/>

You claim that being a "Gilliam apologist" is "hip", which is slang for "popular". You are not a "Gilliam apologist". You are being the opposite of "hip". Do you see what I mean? <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I wouldn't pin down your opinion on Gilliam the way I did if it weren't evident from what you've said that your main problem with both Gilliam and Depp is that they're more popular than you think they should be.

      Ah, ok, it's god damn semantics, but not in patronizing way.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
To me, being "hip" is closer to being an "elitist."  But for you, it's closer to being "popular."  Really, it's an odd mix of both, but we're leaning to different sides on it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I said it's hip to be a Gilliam fan, basically, I'm saying that it's cool in more alternative circles to be a Gilliam fan.  It's popular to an extent, in these circles...but these circles aren't really representative of truly popular opinion (world/culture at large).  I would never say that Gilliam is a "popular" director.  His movies are pretty much made to be cult movies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Re: your 2nd paragraph, well, you're just not hearing me, basically.  I think they're both  <em>overrated.</em>   That doesn't mean popular.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
As stated above, I would never consider Gilliam popular.  Johnny Depp is just as popular as he should be: he's a handsome movie star with a lot of charisma who has been in a few of the largest blockbusters of recent years (Pirates).  I really enjoyed his acting in those movies.  But, overall, I've never felt that he's a consistently great actor.  He tries, and I give him credit for that.  I am somewhat perplexed why so many people think he is a great actor (I don't see it), but I understand why they like him (attractive, charismatic, etc.).  I even want to say that diludes peoples' judgements about him, but hey, I want to give people more credit than that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A lot of this could've been avoid if I just left out the "hipster" part of my comment and went with only "elitist."  But since they tend to get lumped in together (see theguitarhero calling belgand a hipster a while back because he hates everything; the proper term should've been elitist), I included both. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh well.  I think this is a good stopping point, what about you, tekende?

      Ritual and formality and tradition and even dogma have their similarities, and yes, each has appeal.  As far as what many a devout Catholic experiences vis-a-vis the Church and the Pope, and what a devoutly patriotic WWII German Nationalist experienced vis-a-vis the State and the Fuhrer und Reichskanzler, or what a devout citizen of North Korea experiences vis-a-vis that State and that Dear Leader, or a devout American citizen experiences vis-a-vis that whole God-Awful system of beliefs and leaders...  it's often impossible to distinguish one from the other.

      Talking to the Franciscan friars at my college, you'd get the impression that Catholicism is the best thing ever.  But then go to a regular mass or read the Bible or read the history of the Church and you'd be appalled.

      yeah it's kind of weird. basically the church doesn't like the idea of gay marriage, but understands that homosexuality is not a choice. the church then goes for consistency by saying gays can't have premarital sex either. it's really an odd way of putting it, but i haven't heard about anything like that from a lot of other religions. i think it's neat that there are catholic gay teen ministries.

      A pet peeve of mine is when people ask you "what you are". And they say "Oh!  I'm one eighth Irish and one quarter french and one sixteenth Cherokee [everyone is New Hampshire is one sixteenth Cherokee, or something] and one sixteenth black and . ..".  It annoys me very much.  And then they start using it to explain their behavior.  "Oh, he's a good cook!  it must be the Italian in him."  That makes me rage. <br/> 
Listen, dickwads.  You are American. Only call yourself British if you are from Britland.  If you are part black, that's fine.  But if you are just naming off fractions of different shades of white, that's irrelevant.  You won't be treated differently if you are one quarter Italian as opposed to being one half Italian, not in this day of age.  Why would you identify so closely with it?  You never grew up in an Irish slum in the 1860s.  They are all granfalloons, really. <br/>

      You don't like to identify with the unique aspects of your heritage?  I personally am proud of all my nationalities, no matter how minute.  That doesn't conflict with my way of thinking in any way (ie: I'm Irish so I must hate British people: false), so why does it matter?

      Heritage seems to me to be a pointless thing to be proud about, because you didn't do a thing to deserve it, it's all just luck, and no heritage is better than any other one.  It's like being proud that the last digit of your social security number is a five, or something.  I'm not saying that culture is a bad thing, but there is no point in being proud that your ancestors liked to eat potatoes, or that in the old country they used to wear socks on their heads on the sixth sunday of January, or something.  And people just do it .. .just because.  If it is a worthwhile tradition--like, going around giving food to the poor--then all of society should do it, not just an ethnic group. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This in itself isn't a bad thing--it isn't a good thing either--but I feel like it leads people to develop a racist point of view on things.  Too often I have heard the words "He's got an Irish temper".  I hate it.

      You're right, sje, I should disregard my heritage and be an atheist.   <br/>

Seriously, your self-righteousness is really getting on my balls.  If I want to embrace a facet of another culture that was handed down to me from people who were part of it and also happen to be related to me, that should be none of your concern.  If I tell my hypothetical kids "mangia, mangia" at dinner because my Italian great-grandmother told me at dinner, even though the only Italian I know is minimal, colloquial, fractured and usually vulgar, then that's my business, isn't it?

      Yeah, you have a right to do those things, and you have the right to identify however you want, but that doesn't mean you should.  But "mangia mangia" isn't really a big deal, and does not really tell me just how much you identify yourself as being Italian.   <br/>

      I'm not close-minded, honestly! <br/> 
I'm just being assertive, is all.  I do think that everyone should be atheist, because I think that everyone should follow the truth.  Just like how most Christians think people should be Christians, because of the benefits of having faith, and being saved and all that.  There is nothing closed-minded about it.

      Religion isn't racial.  If you think that, you don't know what race is.  Race is physical, skin color and facial features and stuff.  You can't change your race, and you can your religion.  To suggest that religion is racial is to suggest that we are born Christian or atheist or muslim. <br/> 
But I'm sure many cults are generational too.  They aren't mutually exclusive.  And yes, Christians are actually brainwashed by being taken advantaged of at an early age to believe lies under punishment of guilt and eternal punishment for even doubting the lies.

      Culture prevents anyone from being able to be neutral and decide later in life.  It's not pessimism, it's a fact.  So people will always be indoctrinated (what sociologists call in less hostile tones "enculturation") from an early age and there's nothing to stop that short of sending every child out into the woods.  People will always have religion and religion will always help enculture a child, even with its absence.

      I'm pretty much with you, sje46. I think my favorite quote about the issue came from a Dubliner who told me, "I don't care if your grandfather drank Jameson by the pint and marched every day to (Some crazy-ass Irish song), if you're not from here you're not from here, so shut up." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think we do this because we're a big, young country with many identities, so we try to steal older ones to give us a sense of legitimacy. Old things, to us, are a hint of the eternal and the neverending. So to claim that you're Irish gives you a stable identity and a history, and that makes you feel good and it makes things make sense. It's similar to all the Eastern Mysticism stuff people tend to like - they're looking to older cultures for older traditions, believing age and wisdom to be the same thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We're looking for self-definition. In our eyes, Europe and China are older and so are more stable and defined. So we try and take their traditions and wrap ourselves up in them and see if they carry by osmosis. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Again, I got all into the Irish heritage thing when I was 19, because I look like Conan O'Brien only pastier (yeah, thanks, heritage), and then I went over there and felt supremely deflated and alienated by the experience for me. I wasn't like these people, this wasn't "the homeland", they were something separate and very different.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like St. Patrick's Day, because it's got good music, good food, and good drink. But I'm not in it because it puts tears in my eyes when I think of the home country I never had.

      Reject their ability? You mean, do I think it doesn't make sense to take another culture and claim it as your own, even though the connection is tenuous at best, just to make self-definition easier? Because yes, I do think that. I think you should figure out who you are on your own, rather than cherry-pick from other identities and make a patchwork hat to put on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's no better example of this than when a friend suddenly "remembers" or "decides" they have a heritage, and dives into it. I had a friend in college whose family were Chinese emigrees, and the day he just starting quoting nothing but Chinese philosophers and started talking up Communism is very memorable in my mind. That lasted for about a month. I must have been just as irritating, running around with opinions on whiskey and beer and talking at length about folklore I'd just learned the day before.

      What if you're raised in an amalgam of cultures (American I assume being the primary one)?  Should the person drop everything they were raised on that isn't distinctly American?  That's more my point.  I don't pick and choose what I am because I yam what I yam (Popeye) already, and I won't tomorrow start talking with an Irish accent and lamenting about the old country just because I'm Irish.

      Well, that's the problem. There's no clear sense of American identity, so there's a great urge to just kind of hodge-podge it. A lot of the hodge-podging, though, feels false and artificial to me. You have someone saying, "I act like ____, because I am _____," which is sort of conforming to a predetermined character. It's...  <em>easy.</em>  You're Irish, so naturally you're Catholic in some way or another and you like the Pogues and drinkin' and have a temper, etc, etc.  <br/>

You shouldn't look for something to tell you what you are and what to do and make your opinions for you. You should make them up yourself, independent of all that.

      Are you asking whether I think being a raised a certain way is the same thing as choosing something in a pretty artificial way? No, I don't think that's quite the same. But sometimes it's really tough to tell the difference. Anyone who embraces "being" something balls and all is always going to seem pretty suspect to me.

      I think culture is something that happens to you whether you know it or not or like it or not, and it's something you don't recognize until you meet someone wildly different. But it's nothing you can choose and it's nothing that you're "told." Which is what a lot of the heritage stuff seems to be about.

      Let's put it this way.  Say a person born to Haitia-born parents is raised with some "voodoo" ideas (I don't know how common this is anymore so if it's just plain insulting, someone let me know).  If you saw this person would you be like "Oh look at you, you're a stereotype, why don't you make your OWN identity?" even though this is the person's upbringing and culture and that's what they were raised on?

      I guess telling the difference is the hard part. You can tell if they're consciously affecting behavior, rather than just doing it without thinking. For example, if someone thinks "I am doing this because this is Texan," they are probably not Texan. If you were honestly Texan, you'd be doing it without thinking. You'd want barbecue because it tastes awesome, or whatever. You'd shoot skeet because you find it a fun and relaxing activity that's a hell of a good time.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you honestly have culture, heritage, or traditions, you probably don't refer to them or think of them as such, is what I'm saying. It's who you are without thinking about it.

      Agreed.  This is why I mentioned being from an Irish neiborhood in a city, or something.  That is you . . .you were raised with those traditions, the memes, so on.  But if you are a white boy from Chester New Hampshire, and you find out that your grandparents are from Italy, so you get a tattoo of the flag on your shoulder . . .that's ridiculous.  You were raised just like everyone else in the town.  Even if you are 100% Italian, it's not justified.

      I think America is unusually proud, in comparison to other countries. There was a foreign exchange student from Germany who was surprised that we said the pledge at the start of every class, shit like that. But it's common for nations at the top of their game to be proud. England and Germany and France all did it in their day. I think it's just reaction, you're on top of the world, you got to tell yourself you deserve to be there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am pretty proud of America, if only because we have the First Amendment, and almost no one else does. That means a lot more to me than any amount of dough.

      Speaking as a (grovelling, sycophantic) foreigner, Americans have a lot to be chuffed about wrt their country. Okay, they aren't individually responsible for it, but I think it's okay to be a bit chuffed nonetheless. To  <strong>not</strong>  be would be almost twattishly churlish. Drive smaller, more fuel efficient cars though, eh? For fuck's sake.

      It's very different for Germany though because of Nazism, and that's not a joke.  Pride is misconstrued as dangerous nationalism there and it's rare for a German to said "Iche liebe Deutschland" whereas we hear "I love America" or "God Bless America" everyday.

      I'm studying abroad in Germany right now and the difference between here and America in terms of national pride is immense.  It's not as if they're just not as exuberant about it as we are, they see it as a dangerous thing.  It makes sense from a German stand point.  National pride leads to nationalism leads to, well, Nazis.  Because of the Third Reich the Germans basically aren't allowed to be proud of their country.  I was talking to a girl in one of my classes and she said that her little brother hung up a German flag and another group of kids immediately started calling him a Nazi.  Of course in America if you're not patriotic you should just git the hell out!  It's quite interesting comparing that aspect of the two cultures.

      No offense intended towards the adherents of such religions, but plenty of offense intended to the religion itself.  Perhaps "cruelly indoctrinated" is better? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have to admit that those that believe in God while still believing in evolution and that the Bible is probably mostly false but still has some good morals . . .I wouldn't classify them as brainwashed.  While I think that God is nonexistent, by itself that belief doesn't involving a huge leap of faith.  IF you fall into that camp, I wouldn't say that you are brainwashed, but I would still disagee with your beliefs, of course.

      I am a little jealous of people who know all that, because it gives them a sense of identity, however dilute. Family and heritage is important to some people. It explains things like why your family eats what they do on the holidays and what's important to your family come wedding time. I agree that it becomes unnecessary around the 1/16th mark, but why get pissed off at people because they're seeking to connect with their heritage? I don't even know where my last name is from, and when I get the chance, I intend to find out. <br/> 
I can see getting annoyed when you just want a quick snapshot of their culture (when asked your question, I would simply answer Canadian), but some people also like to have discussions beyond that.

      Mark your calendar for 2012, when it falls on a Saturday!  My complaint is that St. Patrick's Day and Cinco de Mayo always fall on the same day of the week in the same year.  I think that if you have St. Paddy's Day on Tuesday, you should get a Friday Cinco de Mayo, for example.  Ireland?  Mexico?  Let's get together and work something out.

      It's because Wolcott was able to talk him down that  time, so he didn't bust Darlene one in the chops. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 The last time Lyle and Darlene hooked up, Fate had arranged that Wolcott wouldn't be around, but it seemed like he wouldn't be needed to keep things from flyin' off the rails. <br/> 
 Darlene was in a real good mood for once, and things seemed to be goin' great.  Lyle and Darlene had tore off a good, fun drunk at the tavern, and were fixin' to go back to his apartment for more drinkin' and fun times. <br/> 
 Lyle was happy for the first time in months- it seemed that the bad times with Darlene were finally past. But, driving home, Darlene passed out cold in the front seat of his Baja, and proceeded to thoroughly soak the seat with piss. <br/> 
 Lyle didn't notice until they got home, and when he saw that, it was what finally tore it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 His eyes were opened.  <br/> 
He tucked Darlene's legs back in the car, shut the door, and drove her to a laundromat where he dragged her sloppy, passed-out-drunk ass into a seat. Then he drove over to the 'Glades and sat there in his Baja and cried and cried.

      Oh, no, wait, I think I got it.  This event happened a couple more times.  Once, Wolcott was there to give the same advice, since Lyle forgot it the first time.  For that second time, however, Wolcott was not around to give his sage advice, and Lyle, being the "less-than-sage" man we know and love, completely flipped his shit and severed all ties with the girl.

      I had to read it a couple more times for the last panels to make sense.  Lyle is saying that Wolcott gave him bad advice, the advice cost him Darlene, so he only saw Wolcott once more after that.  Probably to shove a middle finger in Wolcott's face and maybe knock him off his regular barstool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it's hard to see, because most of the people here think Wolcott's advice is pretty sage.   <em>I'd</em>  much rather let a woman who is three shots past crazy sleep it off than chase after her to have an argument over whether I was getting with the guy from the phone company.   But if you want to stay with a jealous girl like Darlene, you  <em>have</em>  to chase after her and participate in the crazy, as pointless as it may be.  If you just stay on the barstool, it's as good as telling her you don't care.  Maybe you won't be there for her the next time she's puking behind the merch tent at the Priest show. <br/> 
 <br/> 
See the second-to-last panel.  Teodor says it sounds like sage advice, but we all know how well Teodor does with the ladies.  Then Lyle says he  <em>was lazy</em> .  He knows he should have gone after her.  He goes right from that to saying he only saw her twice more.  So Lyle's refusal to participate in the crazy was the cause of the break-up, not the crzy itself.  See Teodor's surprise in the last panel that the sage advice didn't help hold things together.  And then Lyle replies to Teodor's surprise by saying he only saw Walcott once more.  That's his way of saying, "It was shit advice, you putz!" but Lyle is too melancholy to get aggro on Teodor.

      I remember everything! <br/> 
I remember every little thing as if it happened only yesterday. <br/> 
I was barely seventeen and I once killed a boy with a Fender guitar <br/> 
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster, <br/> 
but I do remember that it had a heart of chrome and a voice like a horny angel! <br/> 
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster, <br/> 
but I do remember that it wasn't at all easy. <br/> 
It required the perfect combination of the correct power chords, <br/> 
and the precise angle from which to strike. <br/> 
The guitar bled for a week afterward and the blood was - ooh - <br/> 
dark and rich like wild berries. <br/> 
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red. <br/> 
The guitar bled for about a week afterward but it rung out beautifully, <br/> 
and I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before. <br/> 
So, I took my guitar and I smashed it against the wall, <br/> 
I smashed it against the floor, <br/> 
I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader, <br/> 
I smashed it against the hood of a car, <br/> 
I smashed it against a 1981 Harley Davidson. <br/> 
The Harley howled in pain. <br/> 
The guitar howled in heat. <br/> 
And I ran up the stairs to my parents' bedroom. <br/> 
Mommy and Daddy were sleeping in the moonlight. <br/> 
Slowly I opened the door, creeping in the shadows, <br/> 
right up to the foot of their bed. <br/> 
I raised the guitar high above my head, <br/> 
and just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down upon the centre of the bed, <br/> 
my father woke up screaming: <br/> 
"Stop! Wait a minute! Stop it boy! What do you think you're doing? <br/> 
That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument!" <br/> 
And I said "God dammit Daddy! You know I love you, <br/> 
but you've got a hell of a lot to learn about rock and roll!"

      Oh are we doing things? <br/> 
 <br/> 
The thousandth and tenth day of the human totem pole. <br/> 
The morning was distemper grey, <br/> 
Of the thousandth and tenth day of the human totem pole. <br/> 
The man at the bottom was smiling. <br/> 
He had just finished his breakfast smiling. <br/> 
It hadn't rained or manured for over two hours. <br/> 
The man at the top was starving. <br/> 
The pole was a horrible looking thing <br/> 
With all of those eyes and ears <br/> 
And waving hands for balance. <br/> 
There was no way to get a copter in close <br/> 
So everybody was starving together. <br/> 
The man at the top had long ago given up <br/> 
But didn't have nerve enough to climb down. <br/> 
At night the pole would talk to itself and the chatter wasn't too good. <br/> 
Obviously the pole didn't like itself, it wanted to walk! <br/> 
It was the summer and it was hot <br/> 
And balance wouldn't permit skinning to undergarments. <br/> 
It was an integrated pole, it was taking on an reddish brown cast. <br/> 
Exercise on the pole was isometric, <br/> 
Kind of a flex and then balance <br/> 
Then the highest would roll together, <br/> 
The ears wiggle, hands balance. <br/> 
There was a gurgling and googling heard <br/> 
A tenth of the way up the pole. <br/> 
Approaching was a small child <br/> 
With Statue of Liberty doll.

      I read the most awesome Beatles slash fiction yesterday.  I just ran across it on the Gopher protocol . . .really fascinating how much time was spent on it.  Very nuanced.  They had all died and the afterlife was explained to them, and apparently when you die you become a vampire.  But it was so elegantly done.

      While waiting for tonight's promised non-Lyle episode, I will remark simply that I fell down a flight of stairs over the weekend and hit my head on the bare concrete floor. It was like a Bugs Bunny cartoon: I saw points of white light like stars, and a bump appeared on my head the diameter of a quarter. If I had turned around I might have seen a huge bunny with a wooden mallet. My body still hurts from this.
