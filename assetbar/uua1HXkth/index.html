      Hey now.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I live in a comparatively southern part of that fine state (Or used to, at least.) We think that the northern part of the state is boring.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The land, she lacks the curves and mounds of a beautiful woman like we have in the south.  That kind of landscape makes you fall in love with a place, I think.

      My vote for the sound of Nice Pete's voice is that of Shelby Foote, best known for his appearances from Ken Burns'  <em>The Civil War</em> .  Stately, courtly, with an air of a deep, distant knowledge of empires, and populations, and time.

      This was probably before Mom-mom had to die and Daddy's head-shrinking disease began. It shows how his life changed him over the years. Also, taking a tadpole's life into his hands shows a certain preoccupation with life and death, and the control there is to be had over both.
