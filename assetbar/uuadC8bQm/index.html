      A friend and I tried this when we were kids, sans milk-sucking. We thought it would be a prudent idea to lay a dishtowel over a bowl, pour cereal onto the towel and then transfer it to the bowl from there, so as to quietly obtain our breakfast and not wake my sleeping mother. This endeavor was not a success, however, as the process took longer than pouring cereal normally, and was probably confusing to listen to. She was definitely unhappy about being awake and seeing how ridiculous we were being. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Coincidentally, I was thinking back on that last night, so it's strange to see something similar to an instance in my childhood in an Achewood strip the next morning.

      I know that Nice Pete's game is about having the type of childhood where you are terrified to raise the ire of your sleeping father, and that my childhood was very nice and cushiony by comparison.  But I can't help but remember how I felt like I was doing something wrong when my cousin and I woke up before everyone else and feasted upon Lucky Charms.  There's just something about being up before everyone else that makes me feel terribly guilty and alone, and sugary cereal only makes matters worse.

      He said it a few days ago and I criticized him for it then too. It is one of the most horrible things I've ever heard. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I never even saw it as a portmanteau though until now. Thanks for making it even worse. The idea that "jay" meant 'j' just never occurred to me. Letters are letters and they are pronounced as such. Part of the reason why I am fundamentally opposed to "zed": 'z' is a letter, "zed" is a word.

      There is a crappy pop band from my country, New Zealand, who call themselves Zed.  Apparantly, it was Z originally, but they changed it so that when they "made it big in America" no-one would call them "Zee".  They never made it big in America.

 <em>Learning to smell cute has done wonders for my Fonziness, you guys.  It's like I'm a super homo, or some fink.  I yell at those who don't know how to smell.  Crikey, you really need to learn, cousin; it open up the holes.  I'm worldly, so to speak.<br/>

 <br/> 
Commentary: <br/> 
In today's episode, Glad purchases a new cologne and applies it liberally in hopes of matching his hero Arthur Fonzarelli's success with women.  Glad's mindset is planted firmly in the 1950s, as demonstrated by his theory that smelling like a "super homo" will attract the ladies.  Alas, the rest of the world has moved on, and the woman who catches Glad applying his new fragrance in the bushes outside the retirement home delivers a stern lecture on homophobia, sexism, and personal hygiene.  Glad nevertheless tries to hit on her.  Hilarity ensues. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Tune in next week for another exciting episode of "Glad to Meet You!"</em>

      Nice Pete has hell of typing skills, since I don't see him once looking down at where the typewriter should be, but instead at the lid of said shoebox, where likely he has placed some handwritten notes which he desired to put into a typed format to better impress the makers of Wii.

      I think the panel where Nice Pete imagines himself in an old fashioned double breasted suit with photographers using antiquated cameras and flashbulbs is kind of a nice look inside his psyche. The idea that his family would be ashamed of him coming by wealth in bursts of unconventional genius is another, and these strips where we just try and get a feel of what it is that made Nice Pete into Nice Pete just put me in a Place.

      16. The Working Man's Journey <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are a skilled member of the working class, such as a carpenter or plumber.  You and your kin try to make your way through the world with honest manual labor, but you find the domain of the 'upper classes' to be a strange and violent place.  The only way to earn the coins of your 'betters' is not through creation but acts of destruction against the objects they have set in your path.  When confronting your oppressors directly, you must leap upon them and crush them under the heel of your workman's boot, for their bodies have grown soft behind their castle walls.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
PROTIP:  You may find all your labors rewarded only with shrill complaints and further demands.

      calling someone a jesus of anything gets a point across better than saying "you're a winner" or "great job." there's no rule about there only being one jesus. <br/> 
here, echidnaboy saw my challenge and went above and beyond. too many photoshop challenges are not even challenging. i'm getting tired of "wacky movie posters" and "take this image and make it something funny" photoshop fridays on fark and somethingawful. lowering the bar = cheap thrills. <br/> 
echidnaboy is the kid who actually made a science fair project instead of half-assing it like everyone else.

      i just realized i could have just said that last bit, but i was unsure if the science fair analogy would get across to everyone. i, for one, half-assed every science fair project because i would always come up with huge, brilliant ideas to win, but procrastinate and put it off until the night before, when i would get my dad to help me find the quickest experiment he could find online. the only time i really tried, the teacher took points off because she thought "how to make a cartoon" wasn't scientific enough. fourth graders doing animation with sound and a story line and even applying the scientific method somehow do not impress some teachers.

      Agreed. I'll post my concerns with the strip, but I try to put some thought into them and make them legitimate criticisms rather than just saying that such and such sucks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As long as we're being adults about it I welcome criticism and I think it's the most justified thing for us to be posting about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I disagree with TGH though, I felt it was still in character and I enjoyed it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Watchmen though? Just saw it. It was clumsily directed, most of the actors were bad, it had absolutely no ability to subtle instead often preferring to be crass and throw in out-of-character violence for no reason, and it seemed that Snyder didn't entirely understand the book very well. Some of the changes made were very weird as there was no reason to make them and they hurt the work (e.g. Rorshach dispatching the kidnapper, the TV audio during the first Sally/Dan sex attempt). I do not care for the new ending.

      I think the problem was that it seemed to relish the violence and present it with a teenage boy sort of "OMG! Isn't this just totally cool! Look how she broke that dude's neck and smiled about it. BAD-ASS!" which is sort of entirely against the nature of the book. I mean, the alley fight was basically just a fight, it was more violent, more deadly, lasted longer, and seemed to lack the meaning that it had in the book. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It felt wrong in the way that a lot of post Watchmen/Dark Knight Returns comics seemed to only understand "darker and more violent". <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was gleeful violence for the sake of violence when, ultimately, the book isn't particularly violent. When it is it is for a purpose, not because a fight scene would be cool.

      I suspect someone had a contract that requires at least one "elbow being burst open spraying blood" scene in their films. <br/>

I'd also say it exaggerates their skills, but since the Silk Spectre didn't actually have a major role in the book, I don't know what her talents were.

      I think the problem was that the violence was campy while the rest of the movie was striving not to be. It made for a disjointed experience. <br/> 
I thought the acting (except SS2) was passable, if not amazing, but it came across as melodramatic when you put it next to the strange violence scenes. <br/> 
I also agree with you that Snyder doesn't seem to understand the idea of "show, not tell."

      Okay, that's it, you made me do it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Apologies to anyone who already read this on Facebook. <br/> 
 <br/> 
--------- <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am generally sympathetic to movie adaptations of literature. I know that it is extremely difficult for a film to capture all the nuances and layers of a great book- narrative tone, deliberate vagueness, level of description - but that does not prevent an adaptation from being a good work in its own right. In order to do this, however, a film has to compensate by drawing on the unique strengths of its own medium. One could say that this is especially difficult when adapting a graphic novel, since the visual aspect is no longer unique to the film. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I saw From Hell and V for Vendetta without having read either of the books, and loved both films. To me, the criticisms from Alan Moore fans seemed like typical "the book was better" elitism, and Moore an old curmudgeon who was so full of himself that he shot down any attempt before even seeing the result. To call Watchmen "unfilmable" seemed like the height of hubris - is the work of Alan Moore somehow more sacrosanct than that of Tolstoy? But while I still cannot fully accept the "unfilmable" claim in general, after having seen the movie and read the book, I can grudgingly concede that they have a point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The most obvious thing is the length of the film, and the amount of stuff they had to cut even to fit it into 3 hours. Apparently Terry Gilliam wanted to do the project as a 5 hour miniseries, and he was absolutely right. The Watchmen comic is only slightly thicker than V for Vendetta, but much more dense. I didn't expect them to film all of the background textual material like Hollis' autobiography or Nite Owl's ornithological articles, but they could have included more relevant stuff like Rorschach's psychiatric case files. Without that overall narrative, the few snippets of his childhood and the scene with the dogs that made it into the film were disjointed and did not adequately explain his character. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Beyond that, there were the important pieces of the actual story that were left out, such as Hollis' being murdered by a gang as a result of the other Nite Owl's actions. Aside from the cruel irony of it, this plot element was needed for a later scene where Nite Owl snaps while interrogating lowlifes in a bar, prompting Rorschach of all people to restrain him. Not only was this crucial to Dreiberg's character development, but it also illustrated the comic's theme that everyone has a breaking point when faced with gross brutality rather than maintaining the simplistic good cop/bad cop dichotomy as the film does. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Equally important, if not more so, are the small details and minor characters that serve no central plot function but are crucial to fleshing out the world of Watchmen. Without the scenes featuring The New Frontiersman, we are left without the political context surrounding the controversy over the Keene Act and Rorschach comes off as a typical vigilante hero with little hint of the paranoid right-winger and satire of Objectivism that comes through in the comic. When they do appear briefly at the end, it's not even clear they are right-wing, since the editor just complains about there being no new material. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just as the media snippets provided the comic's political context, the scattered exchanges between passerby provide the social one. While the Knot-tops are just a generic gang in the film, the comic's broader representation of them depicts the rise of punk subcultures in the era of Reaganism, as well as anarchism - a theme more obviously explored in V for Vendetta. In the brief panels with Joey and Aline, we also get gentrification and gay rights, the latter of which only made it into the film as a tackily unsubtle scene in the intro credits featuring the murdered Silhouette and her lover with "Lesbian Whores" scrawled in blood on the wall. Most importantly, the part right before the explosion where the couple begins fighting and the psychiatrist and other passerby come to Aline's aid was critical, not only in that it disproved Rorschach's cynical view of the city and its inhabitants, but also because it underscored the enormity of what Ozymandias did. The city in the film comes off as flat and lifeless, only there to be blown up. Perhaps Snyder would have been able to fit in more if he hadn't insisted on doing long, drawn-out shots set to obvious musical selections at the least important parts of the comic, but I doubt it would have made much difference. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then of course there's the matter of The Black Freighter. While the animated clips I've seen look great stylistically, the fact that Snyder chose to release it separately from the film suggests that he does not understand how integral it was to the story. Forget for a moment the fact that each line was written and placed with masterful precision to provide commentary on what is going on in the panel where it appears (something that was also done with background news broadcasts and commercials, none of which was reproduced in the film). The story is clearly a direct allegory for the actions of Ozymandias. Without it, the viewer simply does not experience the full horror of what he has done, particularly as we are so used to seeing massive explosions in film. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Aside from these, there were arbitrary changes that made neither artistic nor practical sense. Snippets of dialogue were altered or rearranged, usually for the worse. For no apparent reason, it is Daniel and Laurie who come to warn Adrian instead of Rorschach, thus making us miss out on the political contrast and mutual dislike between the two. I cannot understand why, after having taken so many pains to make the film visually faithful to the comic, Snyder would seek to make his artisic mark in the aspects that are least under the director's control. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Strangely enough, the one change I did not mind and even appreciated was the most obvious one - causing the explosion with Dr. Manhattan's power rather than some kind of genetically-enhanced psychic brain that was fed scary images. When I read that in the comic, my reaction was the same as Nite Owl's - this is insane mad scientist garbage and a ridiculously roundabout way of accomplishing the goal. I had hoped something more interesting would come of the island of scientists and writers - something like the foundation of a new utopia. This change does not, however, justify the omission of what is perhaps the single most important exchange of dialogue in the comic. After killing Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan returns to see Ozymandias one last time. Adrian asks him if what he has done was right, considering that everything worked out in the end, to which Jon responds "Nothing ever ends" and vanishes, leaving Adrian visibly shaken. The implications are clear - the peace Ozymandias has forced will not last. Without this final scene, filmgoers are left with the unquestioned conclusion that Ozymandias did the right thing after all - an endorsement of precisely the sort of ends-justify-the-means Cold War mentality that Moore was condemning. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All in all, by focusing on the bare bones of the main plot and removing most of the socio-political commentary and rich depiction of urban life that made the comic so unique, Snyder has created a fairly typical (though nonetheless enjoyable) action flick with a predictable twist of the sort found in Iron Man and a host of other films. Nor has he added anything unique to the film experience; rather, his slavish devotion to the comic in the parts he did manage to include only results in a movie that is a fairly accurate, but woefully incomplete imitation of its source.

      Hollis' murder was the last thing cut. It would have made the film just slightly too long to fit into the allowed run time for IMAX. I think this goes a long ways towards explaining how the film failed and was indeed doomed to fail. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I believe I already said it elsewhere, but the loss of Rorshach explaining how Kitty Genovese's rape and murder was the event that led him to fight crime seemed incredibly problematic. It was a defining point for his character and the themes his character represents. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I keep thinking that maybe I will rent the full, extended DVD when it comes out and try to judge the film that was intended, but I doubt it will rectify the many problems that already exist and cannot be fixed simply by adding in a bit more footage.

      Hey Belgand, I know I'm not really on here anymore, but I still think you are rad and would like to speak with you about good Rogue builds and what 4th edition changes suck besides the simplified alignment system.

      I think I'd disagree that the psychiatrist's actions disprove Rorschach's cynical view of the world - he does acknowledge that there are "good, honest men who believed in a day's work" etc.  He just has no sympathy for what he regards as the "trash" who live in filth and do nothing to improve the situation.  He makes the psychiatrist uncomfortable with his laissez faire attitude, causing him to intervene in the fight despite his wife's restraints. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And in the end, the couples die together.  Bernard with Bernie, Aline and Joey, Malcolm and Gloria, the two cops, the owner of Promethean and his brother... I believe the only one left alone in the aftermath is the watch vendor who doesn't really play a major role.  Whether that's meant to indicate that the minutemen will die alone I'm not certain. :P

      But you do spend your spare time crashing through walls and refreshing children? In that case I must get to know you better. <br/>

So is the Kool-Aid guy's pitcher filled with blood or does he use Kool-Aid for blood? I can't determine which is actually more disturbing to me. I mean, I'm familiar with open circulatory systems, but generally you at least have a lid on top or something. If he fell over and it all spilled out would he die?

      So men and ladies I just got back from a massage therapist, as I've been feeling a lot of back pain after that time I fell down some stairs last weekend. The dude was massaging my back and it was pretty sweet and then he's all like "90% of lower back pain is related to the glutes" and he starts all massaging my ass. The sides of my cheeks mostly, at first. It felt hell of good I'm not gonna lie. The whole time I just kept thinking, " <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100110032855/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua5HJJnB">dang, a guy is rocking my can!</a> ". I never thought it would be like that. My back feels much better now, and he gave me some stretches I can do at home, several times a day like. I think the moral here is to remain open to new experiences.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I totally wrote %u201Cremain%u201D as %u201Creamin%u201D the first time, which I find inappropriate and hilarious.

      single male late 20s will be in New Orleans for the next week.  Hotttt.  Seeking romantic encounter with like-minded hetero or homo female Achewoodian.  About me.  I am not a snob I don't drink don't smoke.  I am not wheelchair bound.  partly color blind.  Into all races creeds and national origins.  Into all body types except fat especially if it is from eating lots of American fast food.  If it is just genetic predisopositon to fatness and not because of lazyness or stupidity or being poor then maybe we can negotiate.  Have a quirky sense of humor and very intlectual but not a good speller.  more interested in substance over style and good with fixing stuff.  Looking for multi-cultural woman who likes to cook and wash dishes in the buff on occasion.  rrrrrrawwrrrr.  interest in music spans the entire spectrum with the notable exception of popular top 40 country music and a lot of top 40 pop music in general.  Like to read a lot of interesting books on various subjects and very into geekish interests.  scientifically minded.  <blink><i>very</i></bink> techno savvy.  not religious or believing in that sort of stuff but I do like to fantasize about vampires and warewolves and watch movies about them.  That would be cool to be a vampire.  Big fan of Tom Waits.  Not frequently laid, but I was recently laid off.  Respond via Assetbar please.  Thanks.  PS Pictures preferred naked optional naked and jizzed on not preferred.

      i am 32 but if i was writing a personals ad i would probably put that I am late 20s because this gives a better indication of my age, both physical and psychological.  If you saw a personals ad for  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100110032855/https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andre_the_Giant&amp;redirect=no">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andre_the_Giant&amp;redirect=no</a> and he put that he was 23, that would be misleading because already he had lived half his life.  Based on family history, I am going to live into my 80s or 90s.  People meet me and never guess I am in my 30s, they always guess 20s... usually early 20s.

b.) When I heard that  <em>Pushing Daisies</em>  had been cancelled <br/>

c.) When I was in eighth grade and blue was voted by America to be the new M&Ms color <br/> <br/> <br/> Honestly though, I just appreciate the time I spend reading both this webcomic and the banter of others who also enjoy it. I would be sad if it was gone. The end. No moral. <br/>
