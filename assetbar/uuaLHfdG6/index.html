      You know what gets you hit on? A freakin' wedding ring! I never had a girl approach me once before I had this thing, now even if I'm on a bus looking downright slobbish it's not rare for a cute girl to sit next to me and start chatting like she thinks I'm interesting. This phenomenon makes no sense to me.

      Assuming this is a reasonably common phenomenon, I'd say it's explained by a combination of: <br/> 
 <br/> 
a) Having passed muster with  <em>some</em>  woman, which increases the likelihood of the guy being a worthwhile prospect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
b) Having a reasonable chance of 'safe' flirtation with a married man; that is, there's a fair chance a committed fellow will chat amiably without assuming that pussy is on the table (as it were). It's not a million miles away from gay guys being safe to chat to. If a married man (who fulfills condition 'a')  <em>does</em>  respond to being half-flirted with, it may well be 'meant to be'.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pop psychology, perhaps, but seems reasonable.

      Those reasons probably have something to do with it, especially the second, because many women love to flirt. I think even if they don't notice the ring there's the fact that a domesticated man has been groomed, sometimes without his noticing, or through nagging. This may be why the most successful players have female friends they don't bone. I mean, women have over 100 rules about belts alone, there is no way a straight man could figure this stuff out on his own.

      Does it really matter that much what the calls the guy? 'Stad, Onstad, Comic Guy, The dude with the stuffed otter, we all know who's being talked about. What's the point of getting upset at the vocabulary when the intended message is understandable.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I only quip not because of this one incident in particular, but instead because I see this being a "serious" issue throughout the strips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is my fourth time in some years reading through the archive, the first time I made an account just to see what these lamed posts where everyone was talking about. I have to say commonly I am so far more disappointed in the fickleness of the lame-ers than I am of the perceived crassness of the lame-ees. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Granted you both got lamed into oblivion, so why's it even gotta be a thing.

      When I was in my environmental issues class, I did research project on rabbit overpopulation in Australia. I learned several crazy rabbit facts. <br/> 
-- Rabbits reach sexual maturity after 3 months. <br/> 
-- Rabbits have 28-day-long pregnancies <br/> 
-- (This one  <em>blows my mind</em> ) female rabbits have the ability during their pregancy, if sensing that the environment will not support their young, to reabsorb their litter and NOT have the babies. Let me repeat that; Momma rabbits can suck babies back into their bodies and essentially abort the babies  <em>just because</em> . <br/> 
--In old lighthouses, the residents would keep hutches of rabbits and, in the case of food running low, they could eat the rabbits. <br/> 
--Finally, during ages of exploration, the British populated nearby islands with rabbits so that, in the case of a shipwreck, the sailors would have a prevalent food source on the island. <br/> 
I hope whoever reads this feels enlightened about rabbits and their inherent  <em>evilness</em> .

      An ambulance that employed the principles of hopping instead of rolling would be an ambulance that employed the principles of killing its injured occupants instead of transporting them to safety.

      It could be that, like the graceful hopping of the bunny, the ambulance uses the principles of shock absorbers to make it pretty much like just riding on a rocky boat. Just riding through the waves, that's how I always pictured it.

      It was really sad when I saw the front page of the Metro newspaper a few weeks ago. The headline was about a girl who was beaten to death by drunks because she was a goth. And there was a picture of her in the Rabbit Ambulance shirt... <br/>

      Let's thank god that human ambulances aren't just giant robots shaped like us. <br/>

Actually, now that I think about it, giant robots are never bad. Let's curse god that they're not realistically feasable.
