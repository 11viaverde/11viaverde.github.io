      Assertive?  <em>You betcha!</em> <br/>

Also, I just would like to clarify for anyone not  <em>down</em>  like me -- Chaud is not a character in Pokemon, he is a character from RockMan.EXE which basically combines the Rock-Man (Mega-Man universe in America) with a Pokemon-like master-trainer relationship between armored men wearing skintight little numbers made of data and little boys with big hearts and a thirst for adventure. So if you thought the story had a bonus layer of clusterfuck and you couldn't quite place the flavor, that's probably why.

      I think the original characterization was spot-on.  I am a frequent tie-wearer, and I resent huggers.  Keep your damn germs to yourself.  Also, I paid someone good money to iron these shirts and dry clean these suits so I don't want other peoples' need for affection to effect my budget. <br/>

People should have their hugging status tattooed on their foreheads so as to reduce confusion: HUGGER (you) or BACK THE FUCK OFF (me).

      At my brother's wedding, I was a groomsman. This was back when I still had dreads. My brother wanted me to get a haircut for the wedding, but his soon-to-be-wife said it was fine (she was the one who styled my dreads actually). <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the reception, slightly tipsy, I toasted their nuptials, remembering how domineering my older brother was to us growing up and how often we fought. So by way of welcoming my new sister-in-law to the family, I told them that I wished them lots of love, laughter, and arguments "because without it you have no honesty and without honesty  <em>you have nothing</em> ."

      No myth! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Breaking the seal describes an actual medical phenomena.  At some point after drinking a great deal of anything quickly, your bladder expands past its usual "time to see a horse about a meat dildo" capacity.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So you eventually pee, and the bladder constricts.  But!  It does not want to expand as much the next time.  That's why you'll have to go more frequently after that.  The diuretic qualities of alcohol are just a red herring, like Communism in "Clue".   <br/> 
 <br/> 
This was explained to me by my doctor sister while we were tailgating, with hand gestures and everything.

      people actually use the phrase breaking the seal?  I guess I don't really understand the meaning. <br/>

      Essentially, a dude can drink for a while at the beginning of the night without peeing, sometimes for a couple hours, but once he "breaks the seal", by peeing the first time, he then has to pee like once every 15 minutes for the remainder of the night.

      Given that the RCC has historically shielded priests from prosecution (mostly by sending them to mental asylums or enclosed communities where everyone knows not to let them near children) I would guess that overall their level of pederasty is probably the same as the general population.

      You can't shield someone from this sort of prosecution, can you?  I mean, people come forward and complain, name a priest, and then you get a writ of habeas corpus or whatever, to produce the accused person.

      Well, unless it's prosecuted at the time, the priest accused is long gone, perhaps abroad. In any case, just because an accusation is made, it doesn't mean there will be a prosecution - prosecutors rarely bring hopeless cases, and one victim being the only witness accusing someone since hospitalised for mental illness is not a good case. By the very fact that in most cases steps were taken to prevent re-offending (this is why Massachussetts is the exception) this means that in most cases there will be few victims.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The nature of most sex crimes means that it is usually very hard to obtain a conviction, even shortly after the crime takes place.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, remember that the motivations of churches which have done this (and it's not only the RCC) are to avoid public scandal, but also to punish and protect other potential victims. To have done so ignores the vital importance of the publicity of the criminal process, but this has not been done out of entirely base reasons (except perhaps in Massachussetts).

      I hate agreeing with Lawbot, but he's rock solid here.  My wife prosecutes for a living here in the States, and his description of sex crimes is very accurate unfortunately.  If you can discredit a witness, or cover up for a decent amount of time before charges are considered, you will almost always got off (no pun this time).  I am chubbying Lawbot, and it breaks my heart.

      Sorry, but with your avaticon and user name, it's just hilarious to have you talking about sex crimes.  But anyway, the priests were unfortunatly not hiddena way, but often transferred to other parishes where they continues their crimes.  The priestly prosecutions often had dozens of complainants.  My only point is not to tar the whole Church or think it is a particularly onerous breeder of this deviant behavior.

      Yea at first I thought that casting Samuel L. Jackson as him was just pandering, but then I hit the Wikipedia and apparently Ultimate Nick Fury was actually based on him. I was still working with the classic image I remembered from the Saturday morning Marvel Action Hour.

      I think it's still pandering. I'm fairly certain they had this planned since they first put Fury in the Ultimate universe. (I mean, not this  <em>specifically</em> , but for Jackson to play Fury in a movie.)

      My buddy saw Iron Man before I had and went to see it again with me when I saw it.  He made me wait for the P.S. not because he knew who Nick Fury was, but simply because he knew who Sammy Jack was.  He is a huge Snakes fan.

      I think the clothing may be hanging from a chair or some such thing in front of the lamp, it seems highly unlikely that the edge of a lampshade would support the clothes in that manner.

      I agree, but, admittedly, I stopped listening to them around the time the Moon & Antarctica came out (which sounds like an indie snob thing, but it isn't: it's just that I never got into M&A and kind of stopped caring about the band in general soon afterwards)...so it's kind of hard for me to say which is  <em>really</em>  the best album.

      Christ people, just because people are amusing doesn't mean they should deserve to be given TV shows, TV shows are special things, given to the most worthy people of any society, for example "Everybody loves raymond", or "Dr Phill" or "That show where Paris Hilton and the other slag visit farms and shit" or the gelatinous slabs of humanity that populate the "Big Brother" houses. People of artistic, personal and professional integrity. Pinnacles of our culture, not just to oft amusing people on an obscure discussion site.

      When I was high school I, like most boys, was trying to be cool in exactly  <em>all</em>  the wrong ways. I decided to buy myself a Washington Capitals jersey because that is the team that plays hockey in my hometown, even though not only do I not care whether they win any games, I care very little for the sport of hockey in general like most young men of my racial persuasion. When people asked me if I was a fan, I usually told them that I was not. They then typically responded, "Oh, so you're just wearing it for the colors?" I had always presumed that this meant I was wearing it simply because I liked it aesthetically. On reflection, this not only makes me sound like a rich douchebag tossing his cash about like gism at the end of a porno shoot  <em>Is that why it is called a money shot?</em>  but also where I am from it is very likely that the question asked was designed to ascertain my gang affiliation, which in fact was a possibility that did not cross my mind  <em>until this very day.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
But this is not a story about overabundance of wealth nor an overabundance of gunshot wounds, I told you this story to tell you a story about my own dorkiness: One day I was wearing this jersey and I went to my locker to get my things for my afternoon classes when I rather attractive young lady who was probably an underclassman judging by her size and my having never seen her before  <em>hur hur you make me feel BIG</em>  came up to me and said, "So is there a game tonight?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Completely flustered, heart aflutter, and flabbergasted by this feminine attention I struggled to find the words to explain to this young lady our lack of common interest in such a way that would not render her unwanting to bone me, but I did not succeed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I said, "Oh, s-sorry, I don't really follow soccer..." <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then I walked away like McLovin after having told her what time it was.

      That's not at all how you read faces.  You were pretty close (I have an IQ of 70) but let's do this step-by-step. <br/> 
 <br/> 
1.  Recognize stereotypes that have a connotation to a thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Your eyebrow piercing tells me that you like to receive oral sex." <br/> 
 <br/> 
2.  State the thing(s). <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I think you like oral sex.  Receiving it." <br/> 
 <br/> 
3.  Interpret obscure details in a way that makes you feel pretty good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"The way you're smirking makes me think that I have a good penis." <br/> 
 <br/> 
4.  If you are looking at a babe's face, be sure to remind her that she is compatible with you and incompatible with anyone else except Jesus maybe if she is religious because you never want to have that talk with a girl until after you are both putting your clothes back on and you just don't care anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Come on girl I am so lonely.  You would look pretty good with Jesus but he aint around." <br/> 
 <br/> 
5.  Remind people that no matter how zany your assetbar posts may be, your sexual orientation is pretty socially-acceptable by most standards. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"You look pretty good in a platonic way, man.  No homo." <br/> 
 <br/> 
6.  Practice saying things such as "That scar above your left eye.  It makes me feel as if there are deeper scars... in your vag."  (Some dudes opt for heart, but honestly you may want to get straight to the point if you have stooped to face-reading in the first place.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Show me your box." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Definitely keep it up man you are not half bad.

      It is possible - just go with me here - that other people, even people on this board,  <em>don't find the topic as interesting as you do.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
If the fish ain't biting, after a while you gotta start thinking you're using the wrong bait. <br/>

      This weekend my friends and I came up with a couple of politically-themed euphemisms for sex acts: <br/> 
 <br/> 
-The Missouri Compromise: When a religious Southern girl has anal sex in order to preserve her 'virginity'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
-The Munich Agreement: When a girl agrees to let you shit on her chest instead of fucking her, and afterwards you fuck her anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A chubby will go to the best suggestion for "Tuesday Surprise" (or "October Surprise" if you prefer).

We often evaluated films and TV shows based on how they depicted these relationships. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For example, that horrible remake of  <em>House of Wax</em>  where Paris Hilton plays a slutty bimbo (clearly an Oscar-worthy performance) banging a black dude and they both get killed as required by the Horror Movie Hays Code? We said that " <em>House of Wax</em>  is not Down With The Swirl."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Whereas, in  <em>Lost</em> , the relationship depicted between Bernard and Rose is a moving story of love and loss, so naturally us douchebags reduced it to " <em>Lost</em> : Down With The Swirl, Awww Yeah."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That means that if, in the upcoming  <em>Star Trek</em>  movie, Uhura actually bones Kirk while not under some kind of mind control and its not an evil clone version of her, then we'll say, "J.J. Abrams: Down With The Swirl." A lifetime achievement award shall be his due. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I pray to Edwell that an image of the Official Seal of the Down With The Swirl literary prize shall soon grace the pages of assetbar.

"He approves of the mingling of peoples and their being joined together by treaties" <br/>

      If memory serves me, I think a Tuesday Surprise is when a man with an STI, say, Herpes, spends a weekend having sex with a random girl who he will never see again.  Then she finds out on Tuesday that she has Herpes?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
This could be changed to spending a summer fucking a random girl, only for her to get the bad news in October.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess what I'm trying to say is how long does it take for Herpes to manifest physically?

      A Tuesday surprise is when Wimpy admits that he still doesn't have the cash to pay you back for that hamburger, so he offers to blow you instead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
An October surprise is the old Halloween gag where you sit very still on the front porch in a mask and scarecrow clothes with a bowl of candy on your lap and a sign that says "Please take one".  The bowl has a hole cut in the bottom and your dick is in a "Three Musketeers" wrapper.

      I am going to venture an explanation. Or, a dual explanation--- <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. When you're trying to show how you're smarter than everyone else, misspelling simple homonyms tends to make us think the opposite (see: I WILL FUCKING CRUSH YOU IF YOU TRY TO PIGON WHOLE ME) <br/>

      I think that the reason achilleselbow hates you is the same reason that everyone else hates you, namely, you are a giant douche.  Your douchebaggery is rapidly approaching the level of alreadyinuse, poing, socks, and their ilk.  Your comments are annoying, your spelling is attrocious, at no point during your insane rambling do you even approach a rational thought, you are just a giant fucking asshole.  Arguing with you will do no good, however, so from this point on, I will not respond to any of your ridiculous posts, I just thought you might want to know why people hate you.

      The point may have been that it's pretty rare to encounter a genuine "not that there's anything wrong with that" these days because it usually means the speaker is actually kinda freaked out by whatever there is not anything wrong with.

      I'll do my favorite thing and agree and point out an error.  The full 'Turing' form of the machine (non lambda-based) was indeed in the proof for Hilbert's tenth (I don't type that whole godawful name). <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, Turing wasn't the first to solve the problem.  The other god of CS was, Alonzo Church.  He proved the undecidability of the problem first and gets no love.  Well, at least less love than he deserves.

I'm wondering whether it's Thatcher because I've heard she was a nasty bitch and was down with that sort of thing.  But, of course, it's too much of an effort to read a good quick rundown about her and the stuff of the times - because the good people on Wikipedia have to make it like  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100110031547/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcherism">READING A</a>   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100110031547/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher">FUCKING MASSIVE ESSAY ON IT.</a> <br/> <br/> <br/> <em>NOTE: I know this is kind of the point of Wikipedia, what with it being objective and an encyclopedia and everything - I am just being overreactive and lazy.

      It's impossible not to mention Turing a lot.  Turing is amazing.  Turing drops into casual conversation between all sorts of people.  I believe Assetbar, if anything, needs more Turing.  Turing is civilization.  Just look at this Turing conversation we're having now.  The name Turing has been used more than seven times, just between the two of us.  That's a ton of Turing.  More Turing than almost anyone can imagine, which is still not enough Turing.  (I'm a computer scientist, so I cum like a geyser every time I use his name)

      I think you'll find people with similar mental health issues may come across similar in text/response format. Hence the use of pencil-paper for Psych Tests.

      Well, there may be some validity to your point, like a generally happy person would have smile lines, or a generally panicky person would have bags under their eyes, but beyond that, I don't see it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
A face is something you are born with. It doesn't really change that much over the course of your life once you're basically an adult. It pretty much stays the same unless you have any outside forces acting on it (ie: a scalpel), which I think most of us agree is pretty creepy-looking.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
A personality is something you develop over time. It can change through therapy, new interests (birdwatching might make you more patient, things of that nature), new kinds of friends, etc. etc.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So as far as I can see, faces and personalities have little to do with each other. Are you tying to say that the face you are born with affects your personality, or are you saying that the way your face looks is determined by your personality? Neither seems that probable, so either think out your arguments more carefully before being being defensive of them, or just stop being so dickish. Thank you and have a nice day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fin.

      Please, please, PLEASE create an actual issue of this magazine. Preferably before August 30th, so I can read it as I plan my wedding. Roast Beef and I are basically the same person in this regard...except I am the bride.

      Those cats are just adorable.  Possibly the most adorable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Wait....that's only one cat and some blanket.  The equivalent adorability of two kittens is now ultimately bestowed on the one.
