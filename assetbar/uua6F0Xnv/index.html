      What I find even more outrageous than asherdan's posts is the people that leap onto them and Lame them straight away. Is it some in-joke humour I'm not seeing? Because from the outside it looks pretty shameful. He posts some pretty offensive/irrelevent/whatever stuff which does deserved to be Lamed but even in his replies where he just acts normally, he gets Lamed. I bet this gets Lamed aswell. Kids these days, eh.

      I suppose, but who moderates this? Who invented the whole comments syetem? That's right. If Onstad really thought of asherdan as such a waste of space it wouldn't be hard to ban him and his IP, surely? My point was that for the most part the comments are a valued asset to this site and I enjoy reading peoples in-depth analysis and stuff others may have missed, but after a while people realise that they have the "power" to say whatever they want, and I think the chubby/lame system is to blame for how many arseholes are trawling this site. The internet is a place for true freedom of speech but it's also a breeding ground for sad cunts who no one wants to listen to in real life, for a good reason. This site is pretty cliquey as far as this is concerned, I really hate how some people here obviously post things like "look at his third eyelash on his left eye, fourth panel. That is so how my eyelashes would look if I was depressed, which I am" just in a vain attempt at gaining a couple of chubbies...

      Asher... you noticed how people commenting on you getting lamed, and then going through the whole spiel of not understanding it and then finding out why... well... it is becoming something of a strange pattern in and of itself.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And yet it doesn't seem rightly represented with the lames that by all rights a non-ironic constant repetition of such a process should get.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I gotta say, you're the only person I regret being a dick to, cos ironically unlike the zeitgeist would imply, you don't really deserve it. Definitely don't deserve it compared to some of the vitriol people who disagree with us tend to spew (and promptly get chubbied enormously for it).

I'm sure at one point in the past, he did put something into the strip based on comments made about a previous one. Not sure if it was current Assetbar or before that though.

      I couldn't have said it better myself, but I think that part of it is that you start getting the expectation that his comments are going to be douchy and choose to read them in that light. For a lot of the stuff he posts, if you just look at the words on the page, plenty of people make similar comments and are given the benefit of the doubt; i.e. they are treated as being ironic. This far in the archive, I still haven't seen anything that I would classify as a mortal sin. I read somewhere that he was a dick on the old message board, but even if that were true, I somehow doubt that all the people who lame him have been around for so long. Finally, regardless of whether or not he is a dick, abusing the chubby/lame system to get your daily fix of self-righteousness makes you a far bigger one.

      I may get lamed and called an asshole, but in covering the archives up to 2005 so far, Asherdan makes an equal number of good and/or funny comments. There is called Onstad "Stad", but in sheer dickery the Avatar with the cube is far more lame-worthy.

      There's room for disagreement about Asherdan's post quality, but you're absolutely right about your last point. Soticoto is way more of a douche than Asherdan. They're honestly not comparable. But if you look at post dates, you'll notice that a vast majority of Soticoto's more douchey posts have only existed for a few months; he only joined like 3 months ago, after all. So, in all fairness, there's been less time for a mass reaction to Soticoto.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, he's racked up 27% of Asherdan's lames in 27% of the time (yes I did the calculations). His track record seems to indicate he'll get to Asherdan level shortly. In 8 months we can expect he'll have a comparable number of lames to the almost 3000 Asherdan's got now. But overall I'm with you. If I was to pick between laming Asherdan and laming Soticoto, I'd err on the side of the latter.

      I hadn't taken the span of post dates into account, good call. Nice job on the calculations too, genuinely. Not to be a dick to strangers, ever, but I wonder if the cube/Soticoto might exponentially increase in lames, to a point where some event horizon is reached and so many lames occur that we are all engulfed in a really goddamn lame black nothingness.

      It's okay.  I like that song too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is there any way to bring more synchronicity between Achewood and Rilo Kiley?  Classic RK and Achewood have some of that alt-country kick in common.  I mean Ray could be called a Picture of Success, and when Roast Beef's lungs were giving him trouble, he might have spluttered, "It's a hard day for breathing/Again."  These are just words I am saying, here.

      Lemme 'splain.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The cake was as a basic cake usually is in terms of presentation: I did the whole Bundt pan deal, as I felt a sheetcake would be in bad taste. I made the cake, with these exceptions:  <br/> 
 <br/> 
1) For the "spices", I just trusted my gut and did some cinnamon and a SLIGHT dash of all-spice. I play on the safe side when it comes to baked goods and odd flavored spice, so I didn't go too nuts.  <br/> 
2) For proportions, I went with my Alton Brown's "I'm Just Here For More Food" guide to baked goods. This helped me gauge what was good as far as flower and eggs went, but I didn't go to a lot of trouble with the mix like he does. That man loves to waste time on prep.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
All in all, I'd say the cake was pretty good. If I do something similar again, I'll go with almond extract instead of real almonds, so I get the flavor without the odd texture. The cake wasn't as moist as I like usually, and the raisins are a tad unnerving. All in all, though, it's something you'd feel like eating if you just don't have anything else to eat in your house. I might give it another shot, then transfer the superb recipe here.

      Much as I like this strip, the Scripture Cake seems like it suits some of the other denominations better than it does Catholicism. If you want a Catholic cake, just make yourself a really delicious, opulent cake with lots of buttercream icing and Padre Pio picked out on the top in sprinkles. Eat the whole thing, then feel incredibly guilty, because all the ingredients you used could have been put to much better use feeding the poor. But you did really enjoy the cake! Oh God, no, that means you're an even worse person, because you were effectively enjoying the poverty of others!  <em>This is all your fault.</em>  Quick, say the rosary until your fingers start bleeding.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh well, just one quick pint before closing, the rosary's not going anywhere.
