It wasn't long before it was unanimously decided that I should do as the bears and head for the woods.  <br/>

      Attention anyone who may be reading the following threads in the future. There will be a lot of somewhat convincing sounding arguments below that a "stinker" is a cumshot. I know it seems ridiculous, but the gentlemen go into such detail that they almost swayed me to the wrong side. <br/>

      ejaculate?  this conversation is not about cumming.  nobody, nobody ever, ANYwhere, is under the impression that the 'average' amount of cum per ejaculation is 3/4 of a cup.  not even todd, and most especially not roast beef. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i mean come on.  you know how much 3/4 of a cup is?  you ever watch pornstars drink a glass of semen?  it takes like a dozen men over an hour just to get to about 1/4 of a cup. <br/> 
 <br/> 
it makes so much more sense to be thinking about farts in these terms. <br/>

      well but i mean, what i was saying is that, EVEN FOR PORNSTARS, 3/4 of a cup is a LOT of fucking semen.  i'm not saying anybody feels inadequate about how much they ejaculate, or that they don't.  but no man on earth produces 3/4 of a cup of semen in one single ejaculation.  it would surprise me if somewhere somehow a single man managed to produce that much in one day, collected and totalled.  a teaspoon is very, very little.  i probably squeeze out more than a teaspoon when i bust.  but 3/4 of a cup is a lot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
what i tried to imply was that: <br/> 
 <br/> 
a pornstar cannot produce 3/4 of a cup of semen in one ejaculation, and yes, they are bigger than the average fellow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i'm still pretty certain i said that right.

      furthermore, if we consider this topic from a philological point of view, it bears mention that chris onstad is FAMOUS for inventing brilliant untested vernacular that, while never seen before, more accurately describes a thing than has ever been done in the shortest possible amount of space. <br/> 
 <br/> 
seen this way, it just seems out of character for chris, roast beef, or even TODD to use the term 'stinker' to refer to semen.  it may not smell like roses, but we have to consider it in a metafictional context.  it is to chris' greatest advantage that we KNOW what he is talking about here- otherwise, stinker may refer to ANYthing that smells even vaguely unpleasant and can be measured. <br/> 
 <br/> 
like, when i burn the popcorn in the microwave, what is the volume of the smell produced? <br/> 
 <br/> 
no.  no sir, this is a discussion about farting.

      yeah of course.  i mean, i never actually did the research myself, for all i know you're right.  it just seems to me like nobody is stupid enough to consider 3/4 of a cup a reasonable amount of semen.  my primary contention here is that even todd himself recognizes that as an unreasonable conclusion, and no way is roast beef from ENOUGH circumstances to feel the same way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
but, i have throughout my life been repeatedly surprised by the fallacies of the 'common folk.'  *sigh*  perhaps, once again, i have misrepresented my species. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i still contend that this conversation is about farting.  however, i may well be wrong- that's happened before.  in any case, your point was exceptionally well argued, and my hat is off to you at the very least for that, good sir.

      Ditto, but that's because I never really considered the sizes themselves, just the comparison, i.e. a "stinker" is smaller than you'd think, in my brain being similar to the whole "the water makes you're turds look bigger than they really are" argument.  But, now that I think of it, water refraction or not, ain't no way the average deuce is a teaspoon in volume, even if you're a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101003200120/https://lyle151.blogspot.com/2004/10/jimmy-crapped-in-my-yard.html">methed ghetto cheetah</a>
