      Forced evolution is a bitter and fickle business for even the most devoted practitioners.  There was a time, before the modern age of hand-held computers and Oriental hunting games, where attempting to breed genuine abomonations of this Earth was a humble pasttime for youthful endeavour.  Unknowledged with the finer points of Genetics and Bio-Chemistry, a young mind may want to create life in the best way possible, to steal away a franchise from the Maker. <br/>

An erstwhile innocent soon discovers that a sparrow-hawk and a newborn bloodhound Do Not Mix, but it is not until one's baby sisters raspily stop calling for help under the hoof of a mother razorback that you learn what you Should and Should Not tamper with, the tears mixing with the mud as you track down, like an Attakapa of stories, the hog's dwelling and procede to gut and tear at the young's bellies until you have deemed that you have got your sisters back and able to be given a Christian burial, there in the mud, the first time you call yourself "Reverend" for the sake of propriety.

      I thought that you meant you were paid 50% more than an electric dishwasher (which is funny, regardless of whether you'd meant to write it), and that's why you put a distinguishing space between your job, "dish washer", and none in the half-paid "dishwasher".  And if the "dishwasher" made nothing, as I would guess an inanimate object would, the reference to making 50% more than it is also funny. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I should have read your follow-up comment before siccing the Neurons Of Interpretation on that.  But you have to admit, I did find a couple of good jokes in it.  Well, you don't  <em>have</em>  to admit it-I don't want to be pushy.

      Well, mangecoeur wrote "dishwashers", and not "dishwasher", but I think it still works if you interpret "dishwashers" as a class of appliances, rather than as a bunch of eternally wet people.

      Being a dishwasher is a decent, if gross, way to make money and never have to talk to anybody. Bussing table is far and away the worst job in a restaurant; do not believe their lies, they just need someone to replace them so they can become servers. That said, this comic is almost eerily accurate.

      Agreed; from my experience, it's better not to talk to people. I washed dishes for a while when I lived in Cleveland. It was some Mediterranean restaurant. My first day on the job, I overheard this conversation: <br/> 
Manager: Hey, did you stab someone on Thursday? <br/> 
Cook: No, man, I didn't stab nobody. <br/> 
M: Yeah...okay. And you're sure you didn't stab anyone? <br/> 
C: Yeah. <br/> 
M:....Did you choke anyone? <br/> 
C: Nope. I didn't do nothin'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At first, I was actually pretty happy about that exchange. Not only did the cook not stab/choke someone, but the manager checked up on the complaint. But then I realized that it was Wednesday...so the "Thursday" in question was A WEEK BEFORE. But...at least those things get paid attention to. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The next day was less assuring, as a DIFFERENT cook said this to one of the waiters: <br/> 
Cook: And in the old country, this is how we choke people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He said it in a heavy accent similar to The Count from Sesame Street.... Needless to say, I only worked there for about a month.

      I'm rather partial to  <em>A Night At The Opera</em> .  The packed state room scene, the "sanity clause" contract negotiation, and one of my favorite movie scenes ever, "Take Me Out To The Ballgame" during the opera.   It lasts only seconds, but captures the whole "throw in everything and the kitchen sink too" mentality of the Messrs. Marx.

      I work at a tech support center, so my fantasies usually are about how I'd field calls like they're calling into a fried chicken delivery restaurant, ready to delivery hot fried chicken right to your door, so crispy hot and honey sweet, just the way your fat bitch mama used to make it, mmmMMM, and carry out the conversation like they were just placing a normal order regardless of whatever the hell they'd say, and end the call like I just sent out the delivery guy. <br/>

      It's true that there is something divine about holding a man or a woman's entrails in your hands.  As though you have stolen their life-force, sucked dry the fat that his mother so tenderly layered upon him as a youth with copious amounts of grits and corn, fattening him up like a prize bull so little Tess next door may one day take a shine to him and bring the two families together.  And then he feels like a failure because he couldn't put any meat on his bones; a failure to let his mother have a sister by marriage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So that when he comes to you in the night, aching for your blistered hands around his twitching and pulsing neck as he walks out of the Allsup's with a juice and packet of smokes in a paper bag, you feel obliged to say a Hail Mary and lift the moment up to the Good Lord before you bless him with your animal talents, in a method not chosen by you but deigned to you by the man himself, in the way he moves as he takes his washing off the line, how he cries sitting on the commode whenever his girlfriend storms out the house screaming that she's leaving him because he won't fucking well communicate about the damn important things.  He says these things to you, you just have to know how to look. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So yes, there is something divine about it, but it's not so much about the Power of a god.  No, more about the Responsibility.  Your call to do what is Right, what you know all the angels and unclean spirits are willing you on to, rejoicing and singing in the ethereal realms as you enact the duty. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is something divine.

Western Sizzlin': Wet feet, getting so backed up that I actually went to the bathroom and cried (I was fifteen. It was my first job. I was kind of caught off guard.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mona Lisa Pizza: Palmetto bugs the size of two fingers, that inimitable filth of the French Quarter soaking into my shoes, very expensive wine provided for free by my Turkish manager, free motherfucking shrimp and artichoke pizza. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mangia Italiano: Weed marinara, rats, Stiff Little Fingers on the box, so many free bottles of Delirium Tremens and Duvel goin' around the kitchen that the place had to go out of business. <br/>

He would mention how GOD DAMN stressed out he was, waving the knife around. Then he would mention how he wouldn't mind going back to prison for a while. <br/>

I was 16 and scared shitless.

      I hate both of those teams.  Actually I hate the Rays a little less because they rightfully didn't go all the way last year (I say rightfully because as AL Easters know, the Rays should never go from last place to World Series champs in one season, or ever) and I hate the Red Sox a little less because you finally broke the chains that held you to Manny.  Sheesh, I hate that douche.  But you have some guys that I am not ashamed to be impressed with.  Pedroia is such a thorn in my side that I have to respect him.

the pacific northwest is not all pine trees and environmentalists, you know. sometimes we let a few hundred thousand past the screening process.

      Try working in a dishroom at a buffet-style university cafetaria.  All scooping someone's waste into a running touch of what looks basically like puke, and smells 10X worse, and when it splashes in your eye, there is nothing you can do about it because your hands are already covered in it.   <br/>

Persons of Puerto Rican descent are attracted to this job for some reason.  I don't know why.  I felt like puking so much.

      I had a job as a dishwasher in a student caf for a while, the only major thing I remember is that the soap   hot water burned off my fingerprints, and they grew back after the term was over. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also I was allergic to the gloves or the detergent or something, but only enough to be irritating until I washed off my hands at the end with normal soap. <br/> <br/> <br/> And I got used to my shift co-workers flaking out and having to do the work of 2 persons alone.  I guess that is basically a thing of restaurant jobs as well.

      Pretending like I wasn't an asocial sociopath was one of the most important things I had to learn during my tenure as a bar-tender. Fortunately, the proprietor had been a SEAL/Naval Intelligence/CIA adviser, and was most helpful in these matters. <br/>

I like the newer ones, where they take real people and draw cartoon versions of them. I like them because the person says something like "Here's why I get animated about esurance" which should be a pun on being drawn as a cartoon AND being excited about esurance, but they sound so completely bored with everything about esurance. It is pretty funny.

      I am so glad that I will never have to dish pig again.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember fondly the night I graduated from dish pig to cook. I worked at a late night place from 11pm to 6am. I had to go out and find 3 house bricks in the middle of the city at about 2am. The kitchen I worked in used to place a brick on top of any order of well-done steak to speed up cooking time, these bricks were never washed, and only occasionally replaced.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I failed to find some replacement bricks I "invented" a solution to the problem, throw the steaks in the deep fryer. My days of dish pigging were over, unfortunately the giddiness went to my head and three weeks later I left to pursue a job in telephone sales. (I was fired from that job after three days, best thing that could have happened.)

      Your english teachers sound like the kind of women (I say this because all of mine were women) who had numerous posters with inspirations, and the closer they were to her desk, the more cats there were. She wears seasonally appropriate clothing to school, with a visual indication of what the season is. She has pins for every minor holiday, a sweater for every major one. Today she comes in, and her sweater matches the only-vaguely-literary bulletin board behind her, and in that kind of runny voice she has, she asks all the students how American Idol was, since she was too busy reading to watch, except she knows way too much about the episode, so you make up something that didn't happen, and she corrects you.....  <br/> 
After she regains face, you take out the  <em>Odyssey</em> . She gestures to the white board, where the assignment was written. You notice that she has you start reading some 300 lines in, and you mention casually that you love the opening, can we please talk about it. And she mocks you, and your classmates laugh, and as you cry that night, you vow that you'll make her pay.  <br/> 
You'll make her pay so much. <br/> 
The assignment: "Write no fewer than three pages about the character of Odysseus." Fifty pages later, having discussed at great length historical allusions to his dong, your bloodlust is sated.  <br/> 
She never reads it. She fails you on the assignment, because it was too long.  <br/> 
This is anger. And this is War.

She is a hussey and was only 15 at the time. They needed to get special permission to show her tits and she was then barred from attending the premiere because she was too young to see her own breasts.

      I knew the scene existed because my teacher couldn't figure out fast forward, and stood in front of the TV while that scene was on.  Instead of 'sweater kittens' we got to see sweater fat rolls of a big heffer of a middle aged woman.  My 16 year old self was confused..I could hear sounds of love, but see only a woman who could only destroy male fantasies.

      I once took a non-honors class which happened to be an English elective. It was a horror I cannot forget. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The course was on satire and irony. It was not taught well. We watched movies a lot of the time. Most of the reprobates in the class got Cliff's Notes for Animal Farm or picked up the book on tape for Catch-22. We didn't even have to read all of Catch-22... just 3/4. We had open-book tests to test whether we'd read the book and I occasionally got a less than perfect score because I was finished with the book while the rest of the class wasn't even half-done. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Our final had us read an excerpt from one of George Carlin's books and give an example of sarcasm. I was only able to resist giving a sarcastic answer to the question because I was afraid the teacher wouldn't get it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This was a really good school too. Honors and AP classes are simply for people who can be vaguely bothered to pursue and education. They're usually not the upper-level courses that I wish were provided. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't even get me started on how terrible gifted classes were.

      In my entire school (in hindsight, mind you) there were three classes that were 100% worth taking and have been valuable to my education in the way that all classes should be: AP American History, AP English 1, and AP Spanish. Really what it comes down to is an adequate curriculum taught by somebody who takes it to the proper level. To Mrs. Dartnall, Mr. Hanna, and Mr. Johnson: Thank you, and why are you reading webcomics at work? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, because the public school system is soooooooo fucking awesome, every year the administration tries harder and harder to get rid of the older, more effective teaches because their classes tend to be smaller (due to difficulty) and they make too much money (due to deserving it).

      I was never a person that anyone with at least one brain cell devoted to common sense would have ever called a good student, but I bluffed my way into AP English ("Oh, yeah, sure, I'll do the work now that I'm challenged by it, it'll be great, yeah.").  The teacher in that class, Mr. Daniels, was the most balls-out English teacher there ever was.  He offered a free A to anyone who could beat him at chess; yes, he was  <em>that</em>  teacher. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So one day the school decides that there will be a poetry slam, students and teachers coming together and saying their verses, the usual thing, and Mr. Daniels is in attendance.  His poem is excellent, as anyone could have guessed, but the subject matter is, basically, the love between a man and a woman with an emphasis on the physical side of things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He was fired the next day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is a prime example of how schools are exactly set up to prevent people from becoming kings.  Any good english teacher with a desire to teach art, literature, culture, they will almost all be weeded out before they manage to get in front of a student so that a loathsome trow like the teachers you are all describing can take the position that does not, by any concept of justice and fairness, belong to them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am sorry to subject you all to such a long ramble, but it seemed germane.  If you were ever wondering why you had such crappy teachers who didn't give a damn about anything important, you now know the reason.

      We did that with Othello once. The teacher went out on sick leave and we got the student teacher as a long-term sub. It sucked because I like Othello. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Worse was the class where we read and then watched Beloved. Seeing the film was actually a field trip because it had just come out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We didn't watch Apocalypse Now though after reading Heart of Darkness. Or even the actual adaptation of Heart of Darkness. This was a shame.

GodDAMN that teacher was horrible. Ms. Truan, of Cinco Ranch High School, a real shitstorm of vague academia if there ever was one.

      Our assistant debate coach was involved in some sex scandal. Younger guy, looked kinda like Paul Simon in my opinion. The girl was legal (i.e. over 16), but it was an issue because she was a student in his drama class. Happened the year after I graduated. <br/>

Okay, in one of those there's a strip about a big-butted teenage chick that these old bearded lech's corral and jab some meth into her big ass, and her head figuratively explodes, and they probably gang-bang her, some typically twisted Crumb fantasy.  <br/> 
Something like that.  <br/> 
Well, I met her a few years later- eh, maybe '75. She's telling me the story how when she was 15 she used to hang with R. Crumb and deliver Zap around the Bay Area. Bookstores, head shops, whatever. How she fell in with those clowns, she never said. <br/> 
 He got this weird idea for that strip using her, but she insisted none of that was actual, Your Honor.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
You know, cartoonists. Crumb was a flake de la flakes anyhow. <br/> 
 She was a sweetheart, really, and it was important to her that I understood that that entire episode was all in Crumb's twisted mind. Which was not a big leap to make. Also, she was not a big-assed fembot like that dickwad drew her, she was pretty. <br/> 
Well, we were never really an item, just friends, and she followed her hippie ways where they led. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I ran into her maybe 6-7 years later she was working a booth for her mom at the State Fair in OKC. Or maybe she just called me out of the blue. <br/> 
 <br/> 
She came by my place for a visit a few days later. She'd been in some village in Honduras or somewhere down there doing some typically hippie thing with native craftworks, bags, or something. She'd gotten deathly ill with an intestinal ailment, and had basically come back to the States to recover. She tried to live a healthy lifestyle, but seemed to think she wasn't going to last long. She was a Virgo with a very sweet smile. I'd reckon odds are she's dead now, but if not I hope she's happy. She deserved to be happy. <br/>

I can't decide whether I loathe this with all of my heart of if it actually sounds kind of delicious. <br/>

My sushi spot is open three days a week and run by an older Japanese man who trained in Japan and only runs the place as a hobby. It is on the ground floor of the building he owns on a residential street. He more or less only serves nigiri with a very small selection of very traditional maki. The prices are excellent. There is no cooked food. He probably has a mysterious past that he will not talk about. <br/>

worked at a fish taco joint in SoCal. down in the harbor. boss / owner was a puertican-jew from New York, New York. just a surly cocky arrogant dude. always in your face. always fuck you fuck that. always threatening. just a fucking nutcase.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
he'd be in the shed in the back smoking bud all day. he'd finally get high enough and let us whack back as much beer as we wanted.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
well one day was fucking hell. the waves were fucking pumping. usually i'd get outta there early. but the beach was packed and so was the restraunt. and on my feet all fucking day. just killing me. i could barely walk. i finally got outta there and i could barely surf they hurt so fucking bad.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
gil was a fucking prick. smoking "booya" as well. doin' lines. all the harbor trash stuff. brawlin' with the harbor rats.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
one day i had to mop up some shit. so i stopped up the sink and had my mop water in there. but that is where the dishes got washed.. he fucking flipped. i thot he was going to kill me. he shut the restraunt down for like a 1/2 hour and bleached the whole fucking place. didn't fire me but told me to leave while HE did all the work. man he freaked.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
one time i put seasoned fries in the frier and he shitted himself properly then.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
the most memorable story... i mean, this guy's accent was so thick it sounded fake. he talking about how he's always hurting from these fights he gets in. and he goes to the masseuse he does work on the then Los Angeles Raiders. he says " <strong><em>She works on the Raiduss</em></strong> " <br/> 
 <br/> 
and i am thinking " <strong><em>"What part of the body is the 'raidus'</em></strong> ". we keep going back and forth and he's getting surly as usual and finally he says " <strong><em>The fuckin' LA Raidus!</em></strong> "

      There is only one correct answer: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1) Yell "I can't DEAL with this FUCKING SHIT RIGHT NOW" at the kid who is still in high school. The one who doesn't ever get invited into the cooler for blowjobs from Amy The Waitress Who Has Really Big Tits But She's Totally A Slut. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2) Announce that you are going to have a cigarette outside. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When you come back, the floor will be clean. If you are so inclined, you MAY invite the high school kid to hotbox in your car after work, but then for any future oil accidents, you will need to use a new high school kid.

      I have nothing nearly this cool ( <em>where did you get it I must know</em> ), because it was a shitty cheap small desk from Ikea. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pen, mug, stapler, bills, highlighter, some labels, TDK Gold CD's, wrist band, my wife's passport, and a bit of scrap paper listing our travel and flight plan and the puroresu (Japanese stiff-style professional wrestling) that I wish to see whilst in Japan. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I got all sorts of cool books and toys and shit  <em>around</em>  my desk but that wasn't the question and I'm being a purist  <strong>unlike some of you I'm sure.</strong>

      I got my Psy-Crow figure years ago COMPLETELY with the intention to have it be my Desk Action Figure. I have seen many talented professionals with such toys on their desk, and I specifically sought out Psy-Crow for mine, because he is awesome. <br/>

      In the past, before video, the television news would need to actually go out and shoot actual film for location reports. On the early evening news (typically 6 PM Eastern and Pacific) they would not yet have this footage ready to air and the film would be ready for the late evening news which was typically at 11 PM (10 PM Central). They would give the report with the claim that there would be "film at eleven". <br/>

      Since your avicon clearly represent a porygon2, an asexual "pokemon" from the serie of games "Pokemon", and that your name seems fitting for a girl, as your profile suggest, i find it interesting that you may use the phrase " bend over octafish,i'll drive this joke home" as you did on the ground of the implied sexuality behind it since you may, for the reason i pointed out sooner, not have a genitalia adapted for the task you have set yourself to achieve, lest you be lying on your purported gender or may be using what i would describe as a doppelganger of male genitalia.

      In all my 2 weeks working in a restuarant (as a waiter however) I did pain pills with a waitress off the sink of the women's restroom, stole over a hundred dollars worth of beer with everyone working in the building one night when the owners where gone, bought xanax from the dishwasher, bought a half ounce of weed for the cook, and smoked hella blunts with the other members of the wait staff. So what I'm sayin is I think I've already had the pre-requisites for this course, also I got fired for being the worst waiter ever.

      It just amazes me. I realize he just got back, but he promises three updates: the first one is a reprint of paid content, the second is excellent and perfectly on time, and the third is late. I realize he couldn't keep it away forever, but he just started posting again. That means you have time to maybe work these things out before you promise them and fail to stick to the schedule. I just don't understand Onstad and his schedule of lies sometimes.
