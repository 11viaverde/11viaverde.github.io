      Yesterday's had all those unbelievably stellar new phrases, led, as achilleselbox points out, by "Horse Dogg Maniac."  This one is great, but does not have the repeated and sustained awesomeness of yesterday's.  This is my explanation.

      Is this arc going to place where Roast Beef earns himself a fortune? I hope so, even if he loses that fortune somewhere down the line, because in the short-term it can only mean two extremely interesting writing challenges for Onstad: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. What sort of additional angst and guilt and dread would such a fortune confer upon Roast Beef. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. How would Roast Beef's success affect his relationship with Ray? Ray who is too used to being the success in the neighbourhood, the alpha cat. Would he find it in himself to not be threatened, to congratulate honestly his old friend? Or would it breed resentment and jealousy in that old cat?

      You've been wallowing in the wrong kind of filth. I too am a longtime fan of  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231053413/https://www.michaelkelly.fsnet.co.uk/karl.htm">Ulli's Roy Orbison in Cling-film site</a> . If you mean to say that you've only seen the references here and not the site, you should promptly visit. He even wrote a novel: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"The book is a paperback of 192 pages long. However, it should be pointed out that for reasons of neatness three of those pages are completely blank and devoid of writing. I think it is best to be honest about that up front as whenever I read a book I am always disappointed when I encounter blank pages and feel cheated and suspect the author of being a bungler who could not think of any words to put upon those pages. But in my case at least that is not the case and I could have filled many, many tomes with my stories of Roy in clingfilm. If the sheer wastefulness of the blank pages bothers you, you should do as I do and draw pictures on them or tear them out and use them to write notes to your terrapin."

      Only on the Achewood Assetbar is trolling not seen as merely an annoyance, but a sort of ongoing performance art competition. A proving ground for hibrow griefers. Some are lauded by the community. Some are spurned.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Manflesh here, has clearly gained favor with his found-object spam style. What would be ignored on YouTube or deleted from your inbox, is given new context and becomes unclear as to whether it is genuine trolling, or a satire of internet culture.

      This is art at it's broadest definition. Like, the definition that also encompasses the act of flipping burgers at McDonalds or peeling gum from the bottoms of tables so that it stays in one homogenous lump that is easily disposed of. <br/>

      I certainly think that is a major part of it - the same as how, once something has a few chubbies or lames, many people will contribute to that tally purely because the significant amount bids them to. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In this regard, if he were to give us more of his background - say, if he were to actually do the HandFacePose thing - we would lose a little bit of interest. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But is this a bad thing?  I personally enjoy the character he's portraying.  Some will find at least some of what he posts as art, and some won't.  Others will simply find the meta-character entertaining, like myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then, of course, there's the fact that delving so deeply into it is kinda ruining it.  But also not.  What?

      Man flipping burgers is a job, not an art. <br/> 
But if you just went into a random McDonalds and started flipping burgers, you could call  <em>that</em>  art. <br/>

YES. <br/>

At the very least, the author has to intend to create art. If you scroll down to the bottom, there is a portion of a chat where Manflesh admits that he just posts random crap to annoy people and thinks it's hilarious that we fall all over ourselves interpreting him. It's very revealing.

It is true that someone must have creative intent to make art.  Really, this is the only criterion.  Aesthetics comes into play when you are considering  <em>is this good art?</em>   Tons of shit is art to the fullest just crappy (like the Hirst skull).

      Isn't this the intentional fallacy, though?  One can never truly know the creator's intent; even a creator who volunteers his intent may be lying.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the experience of art is more about the observer than the creator. <br/> 
 <br/>

      The whole intentional fallacy thing was originally a very specific recommendation regarding  <em>interpretations</em>  of the work, but now "the author's intent doesn't matter" has become somewhat of a meme. My point is that, yes, one is free to interpret a work however they like regardless of an author's particular stated intent (though some interpretations are less valid than others). But this can itself only be done after you've decided that it's a work of art in the first place, and I think the best way to decide this is to look at whether the work was created with the general intent of being art (regardless of what the particular artistic intent was). So when Duchamp mounts a urinal on a wall at an art exhibition, you can indeed say that's art (whether good or bad) because it has that intent behind it. But if he just puts his garbage out on the curb to be picked up and you stand there and marvel at it as art, I'd say you're making a mistake. <br/> 
 <br/> 
From the wiki entry on found art: <br/> 
"Found art derives significance from the designation placed upon it by the artist. The context into which it is placed (e.g. a gallery or museum) is usually also a highly relevant factor. Found art, however, has to have the artist's input, at the very least an idea about it, i.e. the artist's designation of the object as art, which is nearly always reinforced with a title. There is mostly also some degree of modification of the object, although not to the extent that it cannot be recognised." <br/> 
 <br/> 
So maybe you can argue that Manflesh is taking stuff like spam and slash and putting it into a different context. The tricky part is deciding whether it really is a different context. On the one hand, internet forums are precisely the place where stuff like this normally gets posted, so you can say the context is the same. On the other hand, you can say this forum is different from those others because we're somewhat more intelligent and use proper grammar, and Manflesh is mocking that very assumption by posting stuff that's clearly out of place. I'd say it might have been art when he used to present Star Trek slash fiction as the alt text, but if he just posts stuff without any setup or context, then probably not. It's hard to say because the Internet blurs the line between everyday life and the kind of non-practical medium-based activity that we normally associate with art. Is the hastily photoshopped buggery found on these boards art, or is it just the new form of communication?

      But what if I put garbage out on the curb with the intent of it being art?  And what if I put 'art' up on a museum wall with the intent of it being garbage? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also you can show art to a despicably average and uneducated person, and she may not recognize it as art, conversely, what *is* art for her may be for you despicably average tripe, and not art.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Likewise, you can show what you consider to be art to a billy goat, and it may just eat it.  Which raises the question - What does a billy goat consider to be art?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that my pet cat considers my laser pointer to be art.  He seems quite fascinated by it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the artistic quality of dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately's posts is not so much the posts themselves, but the interaction of dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately with the other board users.  If one of the regular and well-liked-and-without-a-dumbass-dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately-avitar contributors posted the same posts as dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately, well, I don't think people would take so much notice.  I think the fact that he refuses normal social interaction is, in fact, the most germane quality of his artwork.

      Suddenly? Manflesh has been in the upper stratosphere of chubbiedness since I can remember. The chubbies have not changed. Two things have changed; The assetbar responses condemning his actions have turned into responses praising him, and The Silent Detractors (I hope I am remembering that right as I didn't come up with it) have stopped laming him. Which is wierd because as far as I can tell they have not turned to chubbying him, but have seemingly just called a truce and left him be.

      I was too lazy to follow the links provided by achieleselbow (weird, I almost typed achielesheel) but I finally did because there are no new posts to read here.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And wow! I got a lot of insight into dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately the person. As I read the posts, I thought to myself "wow! this is a lot of insight into dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately the person!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also thought to myself  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>"wow!

 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>"or for that matter if he becomes famous and wealthy from his Assetbar posts, he might be a recluse and never give interviews or anything like that for his fans, so these posts might be all we ever come to know about dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately the person!" </em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>So anyway, my analysis of dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately is that he is intelligent and he seems like a nice guy, but for whatever reason he doesn't seem to be too successful in his interactions with the world, indeed, there is even a sense of hating the world a-la-Pat, of being ANGRY at it.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately the person is probably also angry at Assetbar -- Angry about not being understood and about a community that has a surplus of fucking idiot damaged teenagers who think that their own tripe mono-syllabic humor is all that matters and who cannot read even two sentences into one of his own serious postings without losing track of reality and laming it and condescending to it.<br/>
<br/>
So in the final analysis, dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately the person has turned inward to his own humor, to his own introverted postings which are appreciated by those with a sense similar to his own, and he has turned away from otherwise interacting with the Assetbar community.  It would seem that perhaps dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately the person has no life, for he continues to post here without any real interaction.  Is the random and occasional positive comment on his postings enough for him?  Perhaps.  Or perhaps he simply has no life, no other community to inhabit.  Perhaps for all the inbriated morons on Assetbar, and his inability to 'fit in,' it may still be the best and most interesting place for dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately the person to hang out.<br/>
<br/>
It could also be that he's loopy <em>pickins.</em><br/>

it's too bad (but not a surprise) that the strips with more conventional humor--either jokes about smoking pot or drinking, or cutesy stuff with phillipe, or ray butchering west-coast slang, also some of the "macho" humor like the great outdoor fight and the badass games and the "ha ha that dude is crazy" humor involving nice pete--get higher scores, but the pre-2003 strips that are more surprising in their format get much lower ratings, and plenty of confused or negative comments. i am very happy with the "delete this forum" idea, because many of the loudest people on this comment forum are the ones who have the most standard, webcomicky tastes, and i really hope chris onstad isn't trying to cater to people's tastes by looking at these scores; i get that he's got to make a living, but the earlier, less predictable strips were really something special, and the more recent, more highly-praised-on-this-forum strips are more like other webcomics, just better-written.</em></div> <br/>

i have a hard time finding today's strip funny because i've had one too many experiences with young men, and even a few young women, who think it's really smart and rebellious to act the way that ray is acting today. unfortunately i think today's strip is a little too realistic for me--maybe others also feel that way. </em></div> <br/>

      Man, come on, this is a bit much. I only put the links there in response to someone saying that Manflesh never breaks character. I don't think even he would enjoy being the target of such analysis. Plus, the "has no life" argument is a bit lame, seeing as how you've expressed the same hostility towards assetbar and yet continue to post here anyway, far more often than he does. Tu quoque and all that.

      Sorry for the pages of quotes... I just figured I'd facilitate the exploration of the topic, since I know some people who might have something interesting to say might not otherwise go read those posts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You can take my analysis as an attack on him, or maybe as just rude or impolite, but I don't know for sure if he would take it as such.  I think he mostly wouldn't, except perhaps for the part where I say he's got a dysfunctional relationship with the world and he has no life.  He might take offense to that, especially if it's a valid theory.  I'm just not very diplomatic in how I say things sometimes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the past, I myself would take offense or at least exception to the notion that I have a fucked up relationship with the world and that I harbor resulting generalized and misplaced hostility and anger.  Lately, however, I am able to see things more clearly, and indeed, while I can't say for sure if it applies to him, I can say it has generally applied to myself over the years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not that I'm fully and psychotically in the grips of this aforementioned dysfunction all the time, like the guy on Office Space whose stapler gets stolen.  Even as it has permiated my life, sometimes peaking in irrational fits of anger, depression, hostility, or egocentrism, I have simultaneously had a general ongoing awareness of it.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
For comedic inspiration, I oftentimes draw on my personal experience of this maniacal dysfunction and the personal culture which results from it, and I even extrapolate this psychosis to it's logical (illogical?) extreme end of the spectrum of possibility. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that my performance humor sometimes makes some people uncomfortable or simply turns some people off.  Not everyone is ready for a window into the mind of insanity.  To a large extent, that's often what my humor is.  I'd say I see that in his humor as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the record, the real me doesn't have any hostility towards Assetbar the forum engine nor towards Assetbar the community.  It is what it is.  It could be better and it could be worse, but hey, that's life.  Every last one of us tries (not always successfully) to do the best we can with the tools we have, and it's the journey that's beautiful.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is and will be other things in life for all of us, but for a few moments, here we are, playing a contrived game with contrived rules, and taking it very seriously, as children always take their games.  If you don't take it seriously, then you aren't paying attention!

      You know, it's entirely possible that Manflesh the person  <em>does</em>  have a life. After all, his account is such that he can only post once per day, and he doesn't even post  <em>that</em>  often. So I think we can assume he's not spending all of his time on Assetbar.

      neonfreon, an oft-lamed poster, posted a while back that because of his high lame count, he can only post once per day (or maybe once per strip?).  Assuming this is true, the same thing could've happened to Manny Anny.  I don't recall him ever saying that explictly, though, like neonfreon did. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again, I rarely read any manflesh post longer than a few sentences.  Not that I dislike the guy or anything, but if you've seen one subversive, intelligent pseudo-troll, you've kind of seen them all.  It's kind of 1997 to me.   <br/>

      The real question is, would Ray rather have an imaginary phone conversation than be forced to talk to Pat. Reading the comic you linked to with eyes that can never read today's comic the same way again, I am forced to not only believe that that is the case, but that it should have been patently obvious from the get-go. I mean, really, who the hell wants to talk to Pat, ever?

      However, would Ray concoct such an elaborate scheme when he could just say "Pat, shut up. You're a dick." and be done with it? Besides, if he was trying to annoy Pat, he'd be talking about getting his bone on.

      Nah, no quotes. You're right about the space though. The magic ingredient is %20 (I'm not sure that'll display correctly on assetbar, if not, it's a percent sign and then the number 20) which replaces the space.

      I've always seen Bill Callahan (aka Smog) as the indie rock incarnation of Beef.  Sample lyric:   <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>With the grace of a corpse</em> <br/> 
 <em>in a rip tide</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>I let go</em> <br/> 
 <br/>

      I think it depends on how much you trust current musicians when they cite their influences. I think Patsy Cline is kind of a commonly cited influence for today's indie-country bands like Wilco, The Elected, a little Rilo Kiley, maybe Neko Case (I will accept well argued challenges to my suggestions)? So it's kind of like when Bob Dylan said 'Hey you guys ever listen to Woody Guthrie you need to get up on  <em>thiiiiiiiiis</em> ?'

      The saddest thing is that this guy gets three consecutive life sentences for acting crazy and making ridiculous threats during an attempted kidnapping, while clear-cut cases of rape and murder get something like 15 years. I've given up on trying to make sense of the world.

      He took that jail time because he though if he did he would get to make a ten minute impassioned speech in front of TV cameras. There was some sort of alternate deal with far less jail time where he would just go away quietly, but he wouldn't.  <br/>

They talked to him a few years ago in prison. He said he doesn't regret anything but he wishes he had taken the deal with less prison time.

      Yeah, I watched a long documentary on him on Sports Center a few years back and remember it pretty well. Apparently he was offered some deal that was only a few years which his lawyer and the courts urged him to take. I'm not sure how, but he managed to set up some deal where he'd get to make a speech, but he'd give in to some very serious charges and jailtime. He got his speech, but it was mostly about the Apocalypse and " <strong>FORGIVE THEM FATHER THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO! FORGIVE THEM FATHER THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO!</strong> " which was a pretty unsettling thing to see.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Later they interviewed him in prison. He said he didn't have a problem with anything he did, he just should have taken the deal.

      That wikipedia article was kinda sparse, but it did have lots of links to articles on the year 2007 and the state of California and such.  WTF? <br/> 
 <br/> 
It also linked to [https://www.pacifier.com/~dkossy/rainbow.html]this article[/url] which was more interesting, even if it doesn't list reference, but more to the point, even if it is listed as a reference for the aforementioned wiki article... oh my god! where is the truth! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well anyway.  my comment on this is that it's interesting how much someone who is obviously mentally ill has in common with everyone who believes in God ever.  Ya know how many people must have encouraged this lunacy and given him handouts of cash and sandwiches?  Quite a few I bet.  Yet if he was out there in the same manner proselytizing athiesm or some such, far more people would have reacted negatively to him.

      Through meditation and focus, these monks are able to redirect penile blood flow, slowly increasing the size throughout many years until they are able to reach anime-like proportions.  They use these cartoonishly large penises as weapons into a style of kung fu known to the locals as Dong Pow (roughly translated: cock slap)

Yes... one dude is using his body weight to pull on the dude's junk.   <em>This shit is for real... there are dudes who can pull buses with their dicks!</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have personally seen the results of similar training (Iron Neck as opposed to Golden Egg or Iron Groin chi gong).  The dude bent 2 iron rebars with his throat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's also a video on YouTube somewhere of a dude who is a master of Iron Groin being repeatedly kicked in the crotch and not caring (they learn how to retract their balls back up inside their body).

      For decades, readers have opened the English translation of gladi8orrex's classic novel  <em>is so lol</em>  and encountered these famous words: "It's weird, it's so lol." The phrase has become a classic, but even classics can succumb to time. Now readers have another version to quote - the sentence found in a new translation: "Is sweet, is so lol." In an interview with the Times, translator achilleselbow justified the alterations. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Loneal's project was a great undertaking, and certainly a work for the ages. But the fact remains that any translator is working within their own cultural and historical constraints, and with a work as linguistically rich and multi-layered as  <em>is so lol</em> , the decisions of the translator are more likely to affect the entire tone of the piece. Much has changed since the world of two hours ago, and a new time demands a new translation." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"For example, in attempting to render gladi8orrex's dense prose into readable English, loneal takes liberties such as adding subjects and pronouns where there were none before. Such changes suggest a structure that contradicts the very spirit of gladi8orrex's stream of consciousness. Furthermore, the rendering of "sweer" as "weird" suggests a sense of bewilderment, while "sweet" comes closer to approximating that indescribable feeling which gives rise to the mysterious  <em>lol</em>  that is at the heart of the novel." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The new translation will be released in a Norton's Classics edition complete with critical essays and explanatory notes.

      No! I would've kept talking about penises, because I think that's fun/funny, except I also felt weird and old and I kept thinking about how I shouldn't pretend/front that I'm a youngster full of fresh, uncompromised hopes and dreams and devil-may-care attitude. Talking on the internet about penises just feels like a younger person's game. But next time I'll try to stay in the conversation.

1:59 catgrl131: But why?  <br/> 
2:00 KendiEatsBabies: it all happened before you arrived.  <br/> 
2:00 catgrl131: Ooh, I'd love to hear it recounted  <br/> 
2:00 KendiEatsBabies: chat was dead, i said a thing, went and had a smoke, and came back to find people had responded.  <br/> 
2:00 KendiEatsBabies: but i did not respond. now one has quit and people think i hate the danes.  <br/> 
2:01 catgrl131: .....do you?  <br/> 
2:01 KendiEatsBabies: Danish indie film groups sex is a thing the dear lord should spare us.  <br/> 
2:01 catgrl131: We could start a club....meet on tuesdays....we could have a Thing going....  <br/> 
2:01 KendiEatsBabies: what?  <br/> 
2:02 catgrl131: !  <br/> 
2:02 catgrl131: sorry, lemme retype that  <br/> 
2:03 catgrl131: WE SHALL NO LONGER PUT  UP WITH THE DANES SULLYING OUR PRECIOUS LAND!  <br/> 
2:03 KendiEatsBabies: Right on.  <br/> 
2:03 catgrl131: NO MORE DANISH GROUP SEX!  <br/> 
2:03 KendiEatsBabies: Well, I'm gone, y'all.  <br/> 
2:03   *** KendiEatsBabies quit (Quit:)  <br/> 
2:04 catgrl131: No! We must describe those with pastry fetishes (Doughies)! Don't leave me!  <br/> 
2:04 catgrl131: Oh, I'm all alooooooooooooooooooooooone....  <br/> 
2:06 ubu: why does that guy hate the Danes so much?  <br/> 
2:06 catgrl131: Something about them raping and killing his family...  <br/> 
2:06 ubu: that's awful!  <br/> 
2:06 ubu: i guess i understand, then.  <br/> 
2:07 catgrl131: Or maybe that was me....  <br/> 
2:07 catgrl131: Ah, well, details, details.  <br/> 
2:07 ubu: you raped and killed his family?  <br/> 
2:07 catgrl131: It could've been the Danes. Just sayin'.  <br/> 
2:08 ubu: things get fuzzy sometimes.  <br/> 
2:08 ubu: i understand.  <br/> 
2:08 catgrl131: Yes. Sometimes there are Situations beyond control. *tilts head*  <br/> 
2:09 ubu: is that so?  <br/> 
2:10 catgrl131: Indeed. Sometimes there are things that need to be Done.  <br/> 
2:10 catgrl131: Such as raping.  <br/> 
2:10 catgrl131: And killing.  <br/> 
2:10   ubu nods slowly  <br/> 
2:10 ubu: what's the catalyst for such things?  <br/> 
2:11 ubu: when does raping and killing *really* need to be done?  <br/> 
2:11 catgrl131: That is something every being must find out on their own.  <br/> 
2:11   ubu jots that down  <br/> 
2:12 ubu: i make a lot of lists. and this appears to be something i've missed.  <br/> 
2:12 catgrl131: Good to see you are Paying Attention.  <br/> 
2:12 ubu: i'm always paying attention.  <br/> 
2:12 ubu: that's one thing i do.  <br/> 
2:12   *** drmanflesh joined #achewood  <br/>

2:13 RabbiDPanda: hmmm  <br/>

2:13 catgrl131: Oh really? Then would you notice if I was RIGHT BEHIND YOU!!??!  <br/> 
2:13 ubu: Rochester, NY?  <br/> 
2:13   ubu jumps, wide-eyed  <br/> 
2:13 ubu: wait... hahaha  <br/> 
2:13 ubu: you're not right behind me!  <br/> 
2:13 drmanflesh: ubu are you saying rochester, ny because you want to hear a joke  <br/> 
2:13 ubu: yes, tell me a joke, sir  <br/> 
2:13 drmanflesh: or because you looked at my whois thingy  <br/> 
2:13 drmanflesh: and saw that i am in rochester, ny  <br/> 
2:14 ubu: well, i saw Rochester in your join line.  <br/> 
2:14 drmanflesh: oh  <br/> 
2:14 ubu: and since i was born in Rochester, NY, i thought to myself, "perhaps this person is from my hometown!"  <br/> 
2:14 drmanflesh: i live in rochester right now, that is true  <br/> 
2:14 drmanflesh: okay here is the joke:  <br/> 
2:14 drmanflesh: knock knock  <br/> 
2:14 drmanflesh: hold on  <br/> 
2:14 drmanflesh: KNOCK KNOCK  <br/> 
2:14 RabbiDPanda: WHO IS THERE  <br/> 
2:15 drmanflesh: ADOLF  <br/> 
2:15 RabbiDPanda: ADOLF WHO?  <br/> 
2:15 drmanflesh: A DOLPHIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br/> 
2:15 ubu: HAHAHAHAHA  <br/> 
2:15 RabbiDPanda: NICE  <br/> 
2:15 drmanflesh: WA-AA-AA WA-AA-AA   <-- dolphin sound  <br/> 
2:15 RabbiDPanda: I totally expected that to go in a racist direction.  <br/> 
2:15 catgrl131: I....I am near Rochester.  <br/> 
2:15 drmanflesh: okay here is another one  <br/> 
2:16 drmanflesh: KNOCK KNOCK  <br/> 
2:16 RabbiDPanda: You played with my expectations, Manflesh  <br/> 
2:16 catgrl131: Are you...are you near me?  <br/> 
2:16 RabbiDPanda: Who's there?  <br/> 
2:16 catgrl131: Desiring anal play?  <br/> 
2:16 drmanflesh: ADOLF HITLER  <br/> 
2:16 catgrl131: Immediately?  <br/> 
2:16 RabbiDPanda: Adolf Hitler Who?  <br/> 
2:16 drmanflesh: Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 %uFFFD 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who led the National Socialist German Workers Party. He was Chancellor of Germany (1933-1934) and F%uFFFDhrer of Germany (1934-1945).  <br/> <br/> <br/> Later... <br/> 
 <br/> 
2:31 drmanflesh: speaking of penis wilderness  <br/> 
2:31 drmanflesh: THE SINGING FOREST  <br/> 
2:31 drmanflesh: this is the most tasteless movie i have ever seen  <br/> 
2:31 catgrl131: Hey, manflesh, do you enjoy being an Assetbar legend?  <br/> 
2:32 drmanflesh: it's like watching an episode of lost where every plot twist involves nazis or rape  <br/> 
2:32 drmanflesh: and the main characters are gay  <br/> 
2:32 catgrl131: Sounds like my kinda show!  <br/> 
2:33 drmanflesh: oh i like that people say all this stuff whenever i post! it is pretty funny because i just post crap  <br/> 
2:33 drmanflesh: and then there are these dudes who get all indignant that people are amused by me, they're all BUT HE ALREADY POSTED THAT BLAH BLAH  <br/> 
2:33 drmanflesh: it's great!  <br/> 
2:33 drmanflesh: maybe i should post puppies again  <br/> 
2:34 RabbiDPanda: You've got like a psuedo Andy Kaufman thing going on here  <br/> 
2:34 drmanflesh: i wish the <embed> tag were enabled on assetbar  <br/> 
2:34 drmanflesh: so i could post little songs to go with my posts  <br/> 
2:35 drmanflesh: by "little songs" i mean 4000 hz square waves at max volume  <br/> 
2:35 RabbiDPanda: hahaha  <br/> <br/> <br/> Even Later... <br/> <br/> <br/> 2:38 drmanflesh: hold on i just sat down real hard on my balls  <br/> <br/> <br/> A Bit After That... <br/> <br/> <br/> 2:41 drmanflesh: i feel like i know so many jokes but then i try to think of them and they're never forthcoming  <br/> 
2:41 drmanflesh: so i always just say KNOCK KNOCK and then just kind of go with the flow  <br/> 
2:42 RabbiDPanda: So this pirate walks into a bar with a steering wheel stuck in his crotch  <br/> 
2:42 catgrl131: Eventually, after a long and productive life, he dies.  <br/> 
2:42 catgrl131: FIN.  <br/> 
2:42 RabbiDPanda: and the bartender is like 'Hey, what's with the steering wheel?"  <br/> 
2:42 RabbiDPanda: and the pirate responds "Oh my God I've just been in a terrible accident please call a doctor"  <br/> 
2:42 drmanflesh: and goes "it's really a huge chunk of GHB!!"  <br/> 
2:42 RabbiDPanda: "I'm losing a lot of blood"  <br/> 
2:43 RabbiDPanda: The EMTs got there, but there wasn'tmuch they could do  <br/> 
2:43 RabbiDPanda: He left a lot of debt for his family, it was pretty bad  <br/> 
2:43 drmanflesh: oh that is a good joke  <br/> 
2:43 drmanflesh: good joke rabbidpanda  <br/> 
2:43   *** eatmorekix quit (Quit:)  <br/> 
2:43 RabbiDPanda: Thanks  <br/> 
2:43 drmanflesh: okay let me take a swing at that one  <br/> 
2:44 drmanflesh: a pirate walks into a bar with a steering wheel stuck in his crotch  <br/> 
2:44 drmanflesh: and the bartender says "hey, what's with the steering wheel?"  <br/> 
2:44 drmanflesh: and the pirate leans in very close to the bartender, leaning over the bar  <br/> 
2:44 drmanflesh: and he says "i will pay you 20,000 rubles to shutter the windows, at once"  <br/> 
2:45 RabbiDPanda: What does he do?!  <br/> 
2:45 drmanflesh: the bartender is hard up for cash, it's a recession, so he doesn't ask questions, he moves quickly off to shutter the windows  <br/> 
2:45 drmanflesh: and then there are gunshots outside  <br/> 
2:45   ubu puffs his cigarette, taut with anticipation  <br/> 
2:45 drmanflesh: the bartender asks the pirate, "now what?"  <br/> 
2:46 drmanflesh: the pirate peels off 60,000 rubles from a wad of bills in his pocket, says "give the rest to HIM when he arrives," and then rushes into the men's room  <br/> 
2:46 drmanflesh: the bartender pockets 20,000 rubles from the wad, and a man walks into the bar  <br/> 
2:46 drmanflesh: he is clearly who the pirate meant by HIM  <br/> 
2:47 drmanflesh: although he is not holding any kind of weapon, the bartender instantly knows that this man is the cause of the gunshots  <br/> 
2:47 drmanflesh: the bartender wordlessly gives the remaining 40,000 rubles to the mysterious man  <br/> 
2:47 ubu: this joke is too long to tell at parties  <br/> 
2:47 drmanflesh: the man begins to walk to the back of the bar, toward the mens room  <br/> 
2:47 drmanflesh: the bartender calls out "wait" to the man  <br/> 
2:47 drmanflesh: the man turns around, and lifts a hand, pointing to the bartender's head  <br/> 
2:48 RabbiDPanda: WHAT NEXT?!  <br/> 
2:48 drmanflesh: suddenly, in a flash of insight--"no, it can't be!" cries the bartender  <br/> 
2:48 drmanflesh: as the stranger's finger pointed directly toward his head, he saw in a flash the absurdity of his life--that his occupations had been taken up to distract him from a fundamental gnawing tedium  <br/> 
2:49 drmanflesh: and the banal amusements he'd occupied himself with to hold this hopelessness and tedium at bay, they fell away from him all in a flash  <br/> 
2:49 drmanflesh: the bartender raced out of the front door of the bar  <br/> 
2:50 drmanflesh: paper flyers fluttered in the breeze, a dog chased a leaf; a car passed  <br/> 
2:50 drmanflesh: a woman shouted from a window, "i wait no more!" and then her body came crashing down and smashed against the pavement  <br/> 
2:51 drmanflesh: inside the bar, the mysterious man pushed open the door to the men's room  <br/> 
2:51 drmanflesh: he found it empty  <br/> 
2:51   ubu puffs his cigarette again, quivering  <br/> 
2:51 drmanflesh: he unzipped his fly as he stood before the urinal  <br/> 
2:51 drmanflesh: he pulled his heavy meat from his open fly  <br/> 
2:51 drmanflesh: and began to stroke his stiff length  <br/> 
2:51 drmanflesh: slowly at first, then more rapidly  <br/> 
2:51 drmanflesh: he spat in his hand and smeared his spit over his hard member  <br/> 
2:52 drmanflesh: and then began to really pump up the volume  <br/> 
2:52 drmanflesh: he jerked and jacked, and played with his red head   <br/> 
2:52   ubu gets a hard-on  <br/> 
2:52 drmanflesh: finally he was ready! he was about to shoot his load  <br/> 
2:53 drmanflesh: he grabbed a steel crowbar from beside the bathroom sink, and smashed it against the water pipe  <br/> 
2:53 drmanflesh: again and again he smashed it against the water pipe!  <br/> 
2:53 drmanflesh: geysers of pressurized water shot to and fro in the men's room as the mysterious man pointed his hard wand to the ceiling and shouted I AM THE MASTER  <br/> 
2:53 drmanflesh: I AM THE MASTEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  <br/> 
2:53 drmanflesh: I AM THE MASTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  <br/> 
2:53 drmanflesh: I AM THE MASTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  <br/> 
2:53 drmanflesh: good joke huh <br/>

      1:26 mib: people need to stop forgetting that barack is not all black <br/> 
1:26 achilleselbow: yea thats true <br/> 
1:27 mib: ron paul is a true black man <br/> 
1:27 drmanflesh: i wrote some erotic ron paul fan fiction once <br/> 
1:27 drmanflesh: let me find it again <br/> 
1:27 achilleselbow: ron paul sounds like a porn star name <br/> 
1:27 ubu: ron paul is incredibly fleet-footed. <br/> 
1:27 mib: you mean it sounds like ron jeremy? <br/> 
1:28 achilleselbow: ron paul has a ring that gives him  3 constitution <br/> 
1:28 RabbiDPanda: hahaha <br/> 
1:28 mib: ron paul is a man who stands for his beliefs <br/> 
1:28 ubu: Ron Paul has a wig for his wig. <br/> 
1:28 achilleselbow: and a brain for a heart <br/> 
1:28 hamstar: My wig was bad and I had to take its wig away <br/> 
1:28 ubu: hahaha <br/> 
1:28 EvilAwesome: if manflesh provides ron paul fan fic i'm pretty much bronzing my monitor. <br/> 
1:28 *** eatmorekix was kicked by jollysaintpete (jollysaintpete) <br/> 
1:28 achilleselbow: hey come on <br/> 
1:28 drmanflesh: oh okay so this is a story i wrote about ron paul and my friend pigmeat <br/> 
1:29 drmanflesh: Ron Paul slowly raised his steely black fuck-rod, dripping with deadly poison, to Pigmeat's lips. "Do you desire my explosive sex epee," Ron Paul inquired. <br/> 
1:29 drmanflesh: Pigmeat blinked twice, his mouth clogged by 32 Neuticles held in place by a plug of marine epoxy across his lips. <br/> 
1:29 drmanflesh: Ron Paul plunged his sexual black steel into the mouth of Pigmeat, the Neuticles and epoxy dissolving instantly due to the unbelievable acidity of his penile poison. <br/> 
1:29 drmanflesh: Pigmeat sucked the black steel assault-dick back and forth powerfully as Ron Paul intoned, "I fuck gays, women, immigrants, and working people." <br/> 
1:29 mib: i told you he was black!!! <br/> 
1:29 *** eatmorekix joined #achewood <br/> 
1:29 drmanflesh: Ron Paul looked down in surprise as he noticed that Pigmeat had not collapsed dead due to the powerful influence of his potent cocksolvent. <br/> 
1:29 eatmorekix: what happened to me <br/> 
1:29 drmanflesh: Indeed, Pigmeat's face was aglow with a purple puissance--his bizarre metabolism had miraculously transformed the Mercurial waters into a golden wine from which he drew strength! <br/> 
1:29 mib: you got kicked <br/> 
1:29 achilleselbow: shhhh! he's telling a story! <br/> 
1:29 drmanflesh: "You are the one chosen to transmute my penis juice from the philosophical vinegar into sacred barley water!" shouted Ron Paul as Pigmeat stroked Ron Paul's testicles with a free hand. <br/> 
1:29 EvilAwesome: hahaha <br/> 
1:30 drmanflesh: The alchemical reaction continued in Pigmeat's throat as he slipped his lubed thumb into Ron Paul's anus and really began to pump up the volume. <br/> 
1:30 drmanflesh: okay that's all i ever wrote of that

      I am also alone in a cubicle, but there are many cubicles near mine, so I am not truly alone, just visibly isolated from the rest of the office population.  We yell back and forth across the cubicle walls a lot, as this is a much more efficient system that actually walking over to the cube of the person you wish to speak to, so it's almost like I'm not isolated, except I can't see the people who are yelling.
