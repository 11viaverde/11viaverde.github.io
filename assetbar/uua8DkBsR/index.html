      Am I the only one that finds Teodor the most depressing character in Achewood? At least Roast Beef is upfront about his despair. It's like if there was a depression pride parade Roast Beef would be dancing a top the tallest float, Leonard Cohen all booming from the speakers, while Teodor would be sitting in his bedroom nervously thumbing through worn Morrisey photobooks he hides under the floorboards.

      I think he's more depressing, in that he's about the least extreme character to be explored in any depth. So while Beef is depressed, he is from Circumstances, and so it's a little difficult to identify with him. Teodor comes from a fairly ordinary background, so his depression is more everyday.

      Really? I've always seen him as being prone to depression, but  <em>substantially</em>  better able to deal with it than Beef. He's happy doing his cooking and guitar-playing and taking the occasional run or parkour session and designing stuff, and when he gets depressed he's usually able to deal and move on in a little bit. Beef, on the other hand, curls up on the floor near the outlet and takes showers without removing his socks and the like. We appear to have gotten the "depressed" Tï¿½odor in this one, unless you end up at the square with the light bulb in it.

      Cohen is the voice of outspoken depression as such. Nick Cave comes from that school as well. In the cooking world there must be someone that can be a Cohen to his Nick Cave.

      But... maybe that's the point. Maybe that's what we're all trying to say by suggesting Teodor as the more depressing character over Roast Beef. Maybe... sometimes the "everybear" is the most depressing thing of all... because, he doesn't have an excuse for being depressed, or depressing. He doesn't have Circumstances, he doesn't have that "excuse" to fall back on. I put excuse in quotation marks because certainly that is an excellent reason for Beef's depression. And yet... Teodor can't immediately say "I am sad because I am from Circumstances." Teodor is just depressed, for no good reason, and with no one to really understand. And perhaps... that really is the most depressing thing of all. <br/>

      Beef is depressed, while Teodor is depressing.  With Beef, at least he's an active character who does things and accomplishes things, even through his depression (or sometimes even because of it). <br/>

Teodor, on the other hand, isn't actually depressed, but he never does anything.  Just look at the flowchart.  Any idea he has, he talks himself out of doing by convincing himself it's stupid and/or impossible to do.

      I think the chart should've opened with "Today's the day. Let's do it." Teodor strikes me as the kind of person who wakes up with the intention of coming through on his big plans for life, then getting distracted by everyday cares and self-criticisms. Then reads cookbooks until 3 o'clock.

      Teodor is the character with the most normal 'voice'. I always get the impression that he is the closest to Onstad because of this, but this could be nonsense.  <br/>

      That's not ADD.  He's closer to borderline personality disorder, but a really mild case.  He's just oppositional in general, with no positive self-motivation, no consistent self-image to anchor his relation to the real world.  Hence, the retreat into cookbooks.

      A lot of graphic artists I know are just like Teodor -- very little follow-through unless they get plenty of support/supervision. Teodor would not do well running a restaurant -- can you see him working a hot station on a busy line, cranking out dishes in seconds, watching five cuts on the grill while he does a sauce and keeps an eye on the stock and the supply of garnish? The drawing board is more his speed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, and Teodor? If you're reading this? It's 2007. Polaroid is in bankruptcy. I believe the door-imaging technology you are looking for is a WEBCAM. Ask Beef to set it up for you.

      Is it just me or do the flowcharts nowadays read more like a conversation and less like an actual flowchart? Seems odd and more difficult to follow this way, not at all the way a flowchart should feel. Don't get me wrong, this is awesome, but it has a different feel to it. Just check out the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145508/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=02282007">first flowchart</a>  for comparison.

      Fair enough, I almost forgot about that aspect of Beef. Still though, even Ray's chart (next in sequence) shows more similarities to standard flowcharts than this current one. <br/>
