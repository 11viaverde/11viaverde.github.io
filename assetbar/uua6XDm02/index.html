      If you are an idiot in England, you say: "Aw yeah Oasis are the best band evar, they're well good they are, they've got massive choons you can proper sing along to" <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you are not, you say: "Making bad music is one thing, but Oasis actively promote stupidity. And make REALLY bad music." Or similar. <br/>

Sadly, they remain VERY popular despite being absolutely godawful

      I had the most infuriating argument with an English kid who thought Oasis was the best band in the world, but the only reason he could come up with was that they were really popular and that few of the bands I loved were anywhere near as popular. <br/>

Seriously, stealing lines from Wonderwall to talk to your crush in 6th grade was cool, but what the Christ, man.

      Look, I know it's cool to hate on Oasis. And I'll grant you, the majority of their career warrants it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But come on. Oasis's first two albums were legitimately very good. Everything after that was middling to awful, until their most recent release which was actually, much to my shock, very very good. It's like Oasis has finally woken up to the fact that it's not 1994 anymore.

      nah the Beatles were Liverpool, Oasis was Manchester. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So were the Smiths. <br/>

Blur was the posher side of London, though Damon grew up in Whitechapel (as in Jack the Ripper shit). <br/>

      People exist who legitimately believe that Oasis is a better band than Radiohead. At least one of these people is in the Hold Steady, an american band just as awful as Oasis.

      One good song. ONE song people - "Whatever." You will not find a better organ riff than in Whatever. But it was the single that placed them on the charts and paved the way for the crap that was Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger etc. Totally not worth it.

      Man "Whatever" really is such a great song. I think even someone who hates Oasis could like that song.

      Listen, I know I'm not on the popular side here, but hear me out.  Oasis is kickass.  What more do we want from our rock stars than yelling at each other, swearing, getting arrested, and general cocky shitbaggery?  They are a mumbling train wreck you can't help but watch.  And dammit, I like their fooking music. I got my heebie jeebies in a hidden bag? Hell of rad.
