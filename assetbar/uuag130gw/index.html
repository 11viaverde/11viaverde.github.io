      I'm assuming you're in the UK.  Am I right in believing that Stella is known as "wifebeater" b/c it's a higher alcohol content beer (not the Stella you get in the US) and the local trash gets their buzz on harder, better, faster, stronger?

      it's fighting juice.  it's about 5% abv, but it seems to send people into more of a frenzy than other beers of comparable strength.  i hate the stuff, it's nothing more than the european equivalent of budweiser, but it's got a fancy-ass marketing campaign that has convinced most people that it's somehow a 'prestige' beer.  fizzy pish.  urgh.

      Man, not to knock you, but just because a beer is light and refreshing doesn't mean its pish.  When you talk about beers with a lot of heft but nothing going on, I think of Boddington's.  Flavor-wise it is like drinking a soggy-crust milkshake, and it's seen so rarely over here, its become a fashionable beer.  Listen, I like a pint of bitter as much as the next guy, but just because a beer doesn't weight as much as three small children doesn't mean it's not worth drinking.

      I agree with your point, but I'm not sure if that's what chien was arguing.  I actually dig on Stella, I'm a great appreciator of lagers, but even I have wondered if it's growing prestige among American moderate beer-lovers is more due to a perceived respectability.  This may be the case, but still, to compare an at least decent lager like Stella (that has some distinctive flavor, and yes, a noticable crispness) to Bud is like comparing, well, Deep Blue to one of those shoes that people with clubfoot wear.  Bud is horrible and has no redeeming qualities (besides not costing too much), and I can say that, because I even had 6 bud lights in the last 32 hrs.  I'm making up for it with a passable Bordeaux.

      All I am saying is that I am about as fond of disliking things because they are popular as I am of seeing every dumb ass with an unusual hat drinking Guinness.  It is a double-edged sword.  Or a two-way street. Or a double-dicked shark (a normal shark).  Something like that.   <br/>

      I understand, and friends of mine sometimes prefer to simplify my tastes to being  "fond of disliking things because they are popular," when I prefer to think of it as a healthy, and deserved, skepticism.  I've drunk Stella like it was going out of fashion since it became available in my neck of the woods (02/03-ish), but I, as a still untested appreciator, still wonder if my appreciation is amateurish.

      Oh I feel you on that point.  I know my appreciation is amateurish, but I don't let that get in my way.  You read, you listen to more knowledgeable people, and you trust your palette. Eventually you become better.    Don't let inexperience stop you from diving face-first into a glass of hops.

      Stella is also often very cheap. The nightclub I work at (don't go there) sells stella at £1.50 a pint on certain nights. Translated into dollars that's pretty expensive, but for here in comparison to other drinks it's dangerously cheap.

      I believe that Stella is called 'wifebeater' because of  <em>A Streetcar named Desire</em> , specifically the iconic scene where Marlon Brando bellows "Stella!"  outside the apartment after he has beaten up his wife.

      That's a more preferable explanation, and probably a more likely origin, but the "Stella is 'wifebeater' b/c white trash jackoffs drink it to get more drunk, go home and beat up their wives" story is actually one I've heard from 2 different friends who travelled to England, on separate trips and to different parts of the country (Hull/Birmingham).  Now, obviously, this could be a kind of urban legend type of thing, where the origin has become confused...or it's just a lie they like to tell the Yanks.
