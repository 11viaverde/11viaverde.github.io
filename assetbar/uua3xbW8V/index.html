      This could potentially turn into a pretty long, unpleasant conversation, so I'll distill it thus: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"All my friends are indians. All my friends are brown and red." <br/>

Somebody wrote those lyrics down and said "Yeah, that's good. No need to think twice about singing those words. Those words are fine."

      I think I always can't help but to imagine a scenario in which someone were to say those words to me on the street or at a party. It's totally cool with me that he has brown and/or red indian friends. I just think there must be a more tactful/artful way of stating that fact if one must. And I was in no way implying any racism on his part. I just think he's a huge dork. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But besides all this lyrical nit-picking, I just don't like them. I never have. Even back when a thirteen-year-old me was bowled over and obsessed with Pearl Jam's  <em>Ten,</em>  I could not reconcile my feelings regarding Soundgarden's jib, which I thoroughly distrusted the cut of. I have always felt toward them as a baby animal feels toward fire; I did not have to be instructed that they were bad - it was obvious from forever.

      Apropos of almost nothing, I can and will kick the ever-loving shit out of "Spoonman" on expert bass on  <em>Rock Band.</em>  It is very fun to "play." I'll grant it that and no more.

      Dude, don't lay into a song and then be all "oh actually I really like it on  <em>Rock Band</em>  but that doesn't count it is still a bad song". Enjoy it or don't. Man up and admit it is a good song, they're a good band and  <em>Superunknown</em>  is a good album. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for the "Indians" line, my drug-and-Soundgarden-liking friends led me to believe that it's about heroin (brown) and blood (red) mixing in the syringe. But that could be bullshit, I mean they were on drugs after all

      I don't follow your logic on this. The fact that the song provides an interesting and challenging sequence of colored buttons which must be pushed on a video game does not automatically make it a good song. By that logic I'd have to  <em>dis</em> like Squeeze's "Cool for Cats" because it's boring to "play." I assure you, I  <em>do not</em>  dislike "Cool for Cats." I'm just not with you on this. That game has nothing to do with reality. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end, if "manning up" entails for some reason "admitting" that Soundgarden is a good band, then slap my ass and call me Deborah. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And as for the "indians" line - it would be just a  <em>little</em>  cooler if he were talking about hard drugs, but you and I both know that's not true.

      I guess I'm just surprised that you can have a good time pressing coloured buttons in time with a song you dislike. Surely some part of it holds some kind of appeal, like the off-kilter rhythm or maybe that bass/drum breakdown bit? I've barely payed Rock Band, though, so what do I know. Maybe it's like dancing, as one occasionally must, to Bon Jovi's "Living on a Prayer" and pretending it's a different song. A good song.  <em>Any</em>  song. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Man up and admit it" was meant to imply that you were trying to be cool by pretending that you don't like it when in fact you do, and that this is evidence of a weakness of character and possibly bed-wetting. I don't mean it, or even really  <em>think</em>  it, but nevertheless I imply it. <br/>

      I'm OK, you're OK. Just a music conversation. But I assure that my dislike of that band has nothing to do with wanting to appear cool. If that was my aim, I wouldn't be so free and easy with my admission of briefly idolizing Pearl Jam. I was done with them even by the time  <em>Vs.</em>  dropped, but I sure as shit basically slept with a copy of  <em>Ten</em>  under my pillow for most of 1991. Not cool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I've been explaining to people about how I don't like that band forever. It's fun. I always enjoy it.

      Man, I really like Chris Cornell as a singer.  I think he reall adds a lot to pretty much everything he sings.  <br/> 
   And about Soundgarden's lyrics, lyrical content isn't their strong suit, but, I mean, it's also not really the focus of the music. The same is true of a lot of great bands, even Radiohead. Thom Yorke says how he sings is more important than what he is singing.

Last I checked the Melvins and Sonic Youth were still going strong, completely ignoring all the big grunge scene tragedies such as the deaths within the Nirvana and Alice in Chains camps, Pearl Jam perpetually sucking throughout their entire career, and Soundgarden and Stone Temple Pilots both suffering the indigity of gradual (or in STP's case, rapid) artistic decline followed by the frontmen choosing to front really shitty supergroups...

      I feel sorry for anyone who doesnt like Soundgarden. theyre missing out. maybe we should include these poor people in the whole "free stay at motel 6 if Phillipe becomes President" package. just because they need to have fun at least once in their life :)
