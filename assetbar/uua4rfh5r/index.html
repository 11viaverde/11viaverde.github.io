      In highlighting the stuffed tiger's preference to suckle a bra of unknown affiliation rather than engage in the socially more acceptable activity of watching television, is Onstad subtly "ripping on" the quality of today's "TV," condemning the the culture at large which is responsible for both the decline of the visual medium and underwear fetishization, or did he just want to convey to his audience, through the distorted prism that is Acheworld, that licking bras is awesome, 'cause it's almost certainly been on TITS, man. <br/>

      I think it's neat how you can glean so much about a person's intellect and character from which day's comic strips they liked. <br/> 
That must help you out a lot in life. (Like when you get into fights with people on the internet about how much you liked a comic strip)

      Ray buying weird shit on eBay has been done quite a lot, I can give you that, but it was still funny. Phillipe struggling with simple tasks or concepts due to being five/possibly retarded, also a common occurence, but also still funny. Lyle being dirty is a well established character trait, but this is a new, and funny low for him. I don't see the problem. Onstad is working with the characters he has, doing what they do. What do you want? New characters and ridiculous events constantly happening like in a Sitcom that knows it is becoming stale?

      Well, maybe it's more in the line that they're not really shocking developments of the character.  Phillipe's struggles somehow fell flat with me, even though all the apparent elements were there, and today's felt like the b-side to the vomitting on a football, a classic.  Ray's strip was immense because of the final frame, however.  But that may be due to Ray being a much more developed character. Granted, when I'm "disappointed" in a strip in the ways I've pointed out, it usually means giving it a 3 instead of a 4.  1s and 2s are inherently lame and, like 5s, must be completely deserving. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Even though all of these strips are about Teodor, essentially; all the different ways he attempts and occasionally fails to interact with the people around him. In this way is Onstad is cleverly developing his character in a fairly original way, as far as webcomics go.)

      From the academic side, I'm not too sure that this, as a part of the previous two strips, isn't some of Achewood's better offerrings as I've described to lastlarf.  I, personally, didn't find it extremely funny (frankly, it was the Alt-Text for reasons I haven't yet committed intellectual analysis to), but when I stepped back and looked at the relationships this strip had with this week's other strips, it enriched this particular strip more.

      Pubescent males are more likely to lactate than males of other ages. Except for babies. A mother's hormone levels can produce a baby that lactates shortly after birth.  <br/> 
So it's either; a cracked out whore's milk,  pubescent boy's milk, cracked out pubescent boy's milk, uncracked out whore's milk, babies milk, or crack baby milk. For the baby milk scenario one must create a likely  course of events. Lactating baby kept in a bra used as a sling during a daring crack whore robbery?

      Stellar.  Did anyone else notice that each panel after the first could serve as the punchline?  A lesser strip would have stopped after the first giggle, but no, Lyle is going to keep on pushing that button.  With his tongue. <br/>

Panels 1 & 2 alone would make for a nice minimalist strip, though.   <br/>

      I disagree.  I thought the final panel in the merkin strip was a fantastic punchline. Teodor can't believe that Ray's game is  <em>so bad</em>  that in his desperation he would end up misunderstandingly buying an antique merkin.  And then the alt text just hits it out of the park.

      Lengthy negative comments are a lot better than terse "this sucks goodbye" negative comments. Why discourage people from posting reasoned criticism? Ideally, at least, it generates thoughtful and entertaining discussion. <br/>

If this board had a like-it-or-shut-up policy, I don't think I would visit. Unfortunately, I think I see it headed that way. Every comment expressing anything less than gushing love for the day's strip is lamed out the wazoo.

      Oh, I don't know. I haven't looked at to many thrice lamed comments, but I've noticed several comments that involve detailed critcism have a surprising number of chubbies given how positive the community usually is. The example that comes to mind was when the guy with the avatar of Max the rabbit criticized the dialog in the strip where Molly and Beef fight over wedding plans.

      if it weren't for crackhead dude milk, lyle would probably wane in the 'forcefully throwing up at footballs to see how far they'll roll' department.

      This morning I remembered that I still have one of my girlfriend's bras at my house, and should most likely return it. As I went to put it in my bag, I thought of this strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Today, I licked my girlfriend's bra, because it has been on some of my favorite tits, and because an alcoholic cartoon stuffed tiger assured me it would be a good idea. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not sure if I will ever get over that concept.
