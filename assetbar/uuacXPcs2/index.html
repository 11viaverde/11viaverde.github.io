      I like having this dude around.  While his view of the board as being utterly passive-aggressive - enjoying a sort of sado-masochistic alternation between loving and hating each other - may or may not actually be more pronounced than in common human social interaction, I find his aggression refreshing and entertainingly biting without being over the top.   <br/>

      I believe sortelli's angle is performance art, like gladi8orrex. Everybody wants their fifteen minutes, but not everybody wants to slave over a hot computer monitor all day to get it. It is the new blight of our age, a gift from his Boomer parents who told him he was the most special kid in the world.

      Looking back at this now, I can honestly admit I was wrong - bragging about laming someone is indeed lame, and I myself have been annoyed at people for doing so on other occasions. The intent wasn't really to brag - I was actually genuinely and pleasantly surprised upon clicking lame and not getting the 'do something nice' message, but in retrospect I should have kept it to myself. However, to paraphrase Churchill, I can admit I'm wrong the next day, but sortelli will always be a douche.

      Speaking of pop culture... <br/>

Screenvision, the makers of the pre-movie trivia screens that show at my local movie theater, don't know what pop culture means.

- an unrolled french horn would be 26 feet long <br/> 
- if the heads at Mount Rushmore had bodies, they'd be 500 feet tall <br/>

      Frank Chu draws good ridiculously large boobies. He seems to understand that they're ridiculous too, but still sexy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jim Lee I don't care for. He practically defines the overly muscular, overly detailed nonsense that permeates most superhero art and I don't care for it one bit. He's actually one of my least favorite artists. I'm also having issues with some of the overly scratchy artists working today. If you're not Ben Templesmith I'll kindly ask you to knock it off because I'd like to actually be able to follow what's happening visually.

      absolutely agree--those movies took the slow downward spiral of Mel Brooks' later movies, and strapped rocket boosters to them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have often wondered if I could ever write a film parody with the style and quality of 'Airplane' or 'Young Frankenstein'.  But I think that the "___" movies, and the short attention spans of many folks today might make it impossible.  (However, I am also exceedingly lazy with my writing, so claiming it would be a failure may just be a defense mechanism.)

      I enjoyed the first Scary Movie to a degree but in my defense, I was 16. Beyond that.. I'm still waiting for "FUNNY Movie". At least Mel Brooks seemed to know his subject rather than just watching all the commercials, stealing the catchphrases and adding punchlines that hit like an amputee.

      Real crippling depression is no joke. Most of us, however, have what i would describe as a pretty normal reaction to a crappy world that's simultaneously over-stimulating, boring, pointless, fast, catastrophic and uneventful. it's the Age of Kalyug; everything speeds up until we hit the apocalypse. The drugs are intended to keep us getting on that train in the morning and going to work. Not to make us happy. If everyone was happy and fulfilled, we'd all be revolutionaries.

I don't know what to believe in regards to the whole of mental health and medication thereof, but I  <strong>do</strong>  think people look for an easy way out of personality quirks sometimes.  Asperger's syndrome, depression, borderline personality disorder, AD(H)D, while some cases are linked to actual chemical problems, most of them could be "cured" through basic therapy.

      I see your BBC article and raise you a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054707/https://www.slate.com/id/2176465/">Slate article</a>  about how the placebo effect is probably mainly an urban legend.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Antidepressants drastically and positively changed my life. I do not think it was a placebo effect, since when I started taking them, I was a) very skeptical that they'd work, and b) terrified they'd flatten out all my personality quirks. But even it was a placebo effect, I'm cool with that. I would much rather be able to talk to people without having to, like, hide under a bed hyperventilating for several hours afterward than know that those pills weren't really effective and kill myself before I hit 30.

      I'm fairly convinced that in the case of people who do have certain chemical imbalances, antidepressants do help, as in your case. The problem isn't with the drugs, but with the diagnostic process. There have been a few times in my life where I thought I was desperately in need of antidepressants for one reason or another, and went to a psychiatrist to talk about it. Every time this happened: The doctor asks me to basically tell him what I think is wrong and listens for maybe 5 or 10 minutes max, then gives me a one-page questionnaire with the most obvious leading questions ever, then looks at my answers and proclaims 'yep, you have it' and gives me a prescription along with a generous quantity of free samples and maybe a general recommendation for therapy. Basically the level of trust placed in the patient to self-diagnose is ridiculous, and it amounts to me coming in and saying "give me some Aderall, thanks." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe therapy is more helpful, but from my somewhat extensive experience the problem is similar. Psychoanalysis is out of fashion and most therapists I've gone to were of the laid-back 'help you help yourself' approach. And each time I felt that they were unable to offer me anything that my own constant analyzing of myself hadn't already revealed, since the sessions mostly consisted of me telling them what I think is wrong and them nodding. What's the point of paying for that? What I needed was someone whose analytical skills surpassed my own and who could objectively analyze me and my behavior in a way that I couldn't, and who could take the lead and structure the questions in such a way that would conceal their intent and not allow me to self-sabotage the session by substituting my own analysis or what I think I should say in order to get the best results. But I never found that and in the meantime the drugs either didn't help or helped in ways that weren't immediately clear. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In conclusion, GODDAMMIT WHAT AM I GONNA DO ABOUT MY PROBLEMS?

      Drugs won't cure what you have, but life might.  I think you're too far into your own head and should do like volunteer work with mentally disabled children or cacner victims or something that activated your heart and brings you closer to your own humanity so you can forgive yourself for not being perfect and omniscient and able to bone anyone you want.

      In my experience, drugs absolutely helped a friend who was depressed beyond the  point of anyone being able to speak to him about it.  He was also a very skeptical and very analytical person, who was unsure how they would affect the parts of his personality that didn't have anything to do with the depression. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The change was instantaneous, with his mood lightening, his attitude becoming more positive, he became more productive and fun to be around.  (Unfortunately it didn't get rid of his ridiculous racist thoughts...Perhaps there is another pill for that?  "Equalitol"?  "MLK-Gandhis"? "WhiteMansGuiltrex"?)

      Oh sweet fuck, I hate mother FUCKING folk psychology  and medication debate.  Why?   <strong>Because <em>I</em> have AD(H)D.</strong>   And more importantly, BECAUSE IT ALL COMES DOWN TO SEMANTICS. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, it is just a personality type, I agree.  But at what point is something considered a "mental illness"? <br/> 
 <br/> 
As Dr. Christopher Green once said, "It's only ever a problem, when it's a problem."  I've primarily studied about AD(H)D, so that's what I'm going to be ranting about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, of course AD(H)D is not a new thing - it's in every culture throughout history, with some arguably more than others.  Yes, it certainly is a personality type - but the problem is, the majority of the  <em>rest</em>  of the damned world ain't got it, and have built society around people not built like me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, while it shouldn't be considered really a "disorder", as it's truly the way the good Lord made ye, fitting into the world is real hard.  This has its pros and its cons - the pros are that you think outside of the box, see things differently, have a lot of energy, and are obsessive about the shit you like (of course, the symptoms of AD(H)D can be highly different depending on the individual, so it really really depends).  Cons - actually getting stuff  <em>finished</em>  is like moving a fucking mountain, easily distracted (read: me, right now), miss important stuff, disorganised.  Thus leading onto a lot of extreme failure or extreme success, thus leading easily onto other mental issues: heavy-ass depression, bi-polar tendancies, lack of a social network because nobody can keep up, whatever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So while alot of the great movers and shakers of history have most likely had AD(H)D, 100-fold more AD(H)D-type people have crashed and burned, ended up in prison, done little with their lives, gone insane, whatever.  But then again, a lot just figure it out eventually. <br/> <br/> <br/> The main problem with misdiagnosis is because they need to re-define what is actually  <strong>is</strong> : currently, for AD(H)D there's like 40-odd symptoms, and if you have around 15 of them, you've got it.  So, my AD(H)D and someone else's might be completely different. <br/> <br/> <br/> As for medication - everybody bitches and moans about it.  Currently, I'm on Dexamphetamine after being on Ritalin until my late teens, and then years without anything - but lately, I just wasn't coping and was spiralling into a dark and nigh-suicidal depression as a result, and needed some help.  It's not the be-all and end-all, not a wonder-drug, and it's not going to fix all my problems - that's for me to do, but it's just helping me.  Eventually, the aim is to organise your brain enough to be able to handle your life without the meds.  And God-willin' and the creek don't rise, I will. <br/> <br/> <br/> All that I said could most likely be applied to the majority of mental issues you mentioned.  Asperger's particularly, as it is also on the Autism spectrum, which AD(H)D arguably is - I can totally relate to Autistic people, as well as "normal" people.  It's that detachment from reality and society, which I've got a  <em>little</em>  bit, probably more than other people, but thankfully only enough to be different while still being able to function in society.  It's really only something that affects my own life, and not anybody else's (except my wife, who somehow thinks it's all cute, bless her). <br/> 
 <br/> 
And don't get me wrong - I'm glad I'm the way I am.  I'm awesome.  If I wasn't me, I'd wish I was. <br/> 
It's just a bit difficult at times - same as for everybody, I know, we all got our shit, just mine can be a bit....amplified.  I tend to live in extremes, with tendencies toward Bi-Polar without it being too much of an issue. <br/> <br/> <br/> Bah, I bet none of that made sense - I'm in a rambling, stream-of-consciousness kind of mood.  Hope you had fun with me.

      I've never been diagnosed, but I think I've got AD(H)D. I can identify with all of what you've said, like for example this one time a while ago another friend and I were sleeping over at a friend's house, and when we lay down to get to sleep, they were listening to their Ipods, and they asked me how I got to sleep, since I don't have one. (It makes me sick that so many people have it because it's "cool", but that's a different story about my problems with society, including "Fuck....Hollister!") So I told them that I just think about stuff, and I gave them an example: Have you ever thought about how people believe they live in such a colorful world, when really there are only a finite amount of colors? You could argue that it's a continuum, and there are infinite colors between colors, but not all of the differnces are visible to the naked eye. When I told them that thought that I was mulling over, it went like: *awkward pause* "What?". Then the conversation turned to boys. (Once again, that's another story about my problems with society [mostly female adolescent society].)  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the point is that I get frustrated about how little deviation there is from the norm in my group of (non-internet) friends. They wear converses or vans, skinny jeans, straightened hair, and sometimes Hollister and Abercrombie. They have Ipods They have the same speech patterns (though that's not really so horrible, except for the fact that they talk about the same things: clothing (When I asked one of my friends why she said she didn't like my [flared] jeans, her response was that they're "totally gay"), the males of the species, television, and occasionally some politics or recently read books or random subjects to balance it out a bit). Then they think I'm saying I'm better and more unique than them when I relate this to them, and it bugs me that thinking how the system of society works is anything but perfect is seen as dissent against somthing that works for them. If it ain't broke, why fix it, right? <br/> 
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054707/https://xkcd.com/137">This</a>  really speaks to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, I can identify. I can never get anything done either (for example: right now I am supposed to be translating a chapter in my Hebrew history workbook, but instead I am writing a mini-essay on Assetbar). Yeah, I get really into the things I like, and I get really frustrated with things I'm not as interested in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Most of my friends think I'm mental, because I am either bursting with energy (being a class clown, jiggling my foot under the table, talking too fast and too loud, bursting randomly into song, generally being manic), or completely depressed about how the world works and how much it sucks usually. On those kinds of days, I just look forward to snuggling in my chair with a blanket and reading Achewood (and Assetbar). Keep on rockin' Assetpeople. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyhoo, I'm not really sure if I want to get diagnosed. I mean, I don't want to calm down when I'm in my energy-tastic moods, or water down my personality to make life easier for those who have to interact with me, but it would be nice to be able to concentrate on schoolwork. Should I? Advice please! I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO ABOUT MY PROBLEMS.

      You know, I think it's best to stay off medication unless you are having debilitating problems.  Honestly, I advocate having a couple beers and/or smoking a joint or two every once in a while.  And I don't mean that in the sense of "Oh, I'm so fucked up I am not thinking about my problems."  THAT leads to a hells of trouble.  "Social medication," intoxicants that have been practiced since prehistory, for one allow easier socialization whereas most of the "soft" anti-depressants, etc. do not treat this.  Secondly, responsible use does not alter your personality.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, that's what's helped me.  I've never been a young woman, and honestly I have a hard time "fitting in" with anyone, so I wouldn't be surprised if this is totally off the wall to most people...

      I've been trying that out lately and I think it's working. I keep overdoing it though; I've got pothead friends who don't go more than three days at a time without smoking, so I smoke more than I mean to. Usually I just write a shit ton of "Goals" down in a word file and fall asleep. How does your regimen work? while we're all being so personal.

      After my surgery, the apocalypse happened but was confined to my mom's yard (seven acres, but still), and inside the fence the air was this bluey-grey colour  <em>[i like the way british words look, alright?]</em> , as distinguished from the sky being blue. There was lightning just going back and forth between the tress because they were really clouds.  Also, my dad's cat Simba just kept sitting on a fencepost asking us if we wanted sugar in our tea. I woke up and it didn't occur to me until i was off the percocet that  <em>it was all a dream</em> <br/>

      Thanks you for the gracious introduction, 'Bow.  Ahem.  Cultural references post-Yazger's Farm are fine, but there are limits to anything.  We are legion here in Assetland, and so are the shows and songs and philosophers we can reference.  Instead of playing a "who can guess my hidden secret obscure reference" game all the time, perhaps we can at least give some indication, such as *** to indicate there is a hidden meaning to our phrase.

      I think young Mr. Snyder didn't let me down too hard with 300... but then again, that's like saying just because someone made a nice sandwich, that they could make a nice stained-glass window. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He added that stupid sub-plot with Leonidas's wife and the anal-sex-loving senator, which was kind of like sticking a boiled egg on a toothpick on top of my sandwich; it didn't  <em>go</em> , but it didn't ruin things.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, he may try to recreate God Touches Man, adding in Jar Jar Binks, God wearing a beer helmet, and Adam as a robot.  <strong>There are potential problems.</strong>

      I've been thinking about pogo's long-running complaints regarding cultural references, but his proposed system of explanatory footnotes defeats the whole point of a reference, which is to make both you and the other person seem clever as well as express a bond over common tastes.

      To me that looks like a diaeresis, not a macron, although due to compression it's sort of hard to tell.   It's most certainly ironic in nature, a sort of "heavy metal umlaut" of the gettin' hitched world.   Every time the word is spoken aloud in the ceremony, it must be pronounced "on-oh-oor."

      To properly decide what to call a native of the state, examine the etymology of its name. Researchers of the lost colony of Roanoke Island suppose that Turkish deckhands that lived in the colony gave Middle Eastern names to areas, upon mingling with the Native Americans. These people theorize that they gave the name Alabama as "Allah Baimya", or "God's Graveyard". An article without a byline appearing in the Jacksonville Republican on July 27, 1842 originated the idea that the meaning of the state's name was "Here We Rest", giving some credence to the Turkish theory. <br/>

      Basically the NOD is a rich white man's idea of what poor white men think black power is all about. This is not something most of Black America would approve of.

      Get her motor running, get a nice bit of suction in through the carburetor, I imagine its a bit like a poddy calf... <br/>

Actually I remember reading a scene where an academic has sex with his Porsche in Pynchon's  <em>Vineland</em> .   <br/>

P.S. I did not have sex with that poddy calf, Miss Lewinsky.

      Algernon%u2019s Choice: The Airwolf Diaries <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hardelicious%u2019 old mum came down to his house, all in a flutter. <br/>

%u201CWhat is this I hear about my son using that filthy den of pornographers and drug-addicts: The Internet,%u201D she shouted while lifting his apartment%u2019s door straight off its hinges. <br/>

%u201CWhat, no mom,%u201D Hardelicious protested, as he was backed into a corner under her baleful glare, %u201Cthe internet%u2019s not like that, I%u2019ll show you.%u201D <br/>

So, Hardelicious led his old mom down to his computer thinking to himself: %u201Cshit, what could the internet possibly have nothing filthy on%u2026 think%u2026 think%u2026, something fun and innocent, evoking memories of my 1980's childhood... Airwolf!%u201D <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hardelicious proceeded to type into his search-engine of choice the word %u201CAirwolf%u201D and showed the results to his mother, who, unsuspecting, selected an entry from the middle of the list, foolishly trusting to the reputation of British newsprint publications%u2026 <br/>

There are a bunch of weekdays that CO skipped, so it seems that my birthday is often a day of rest for him.  But he better have something good for me this year (back to Wednesday again) or  <em>else!</em>   I had a kickass, really-relevant Dilbert fall on my day, but I don't want that to be the only coincidentally funny strip on my birthday.  I need  <strong>meaning!</strong>  From a strip on the  <strong>INTERNET!!</strong>

      I know the misspelling is part of the joke, but I just wanted to chime in with a tangentially relevant comment rather than correct anyone. The actual phrase is "Qu'est-ce que c'est?" which literally means "What is this that this is?" and contains about twice as many syllables as are pronounced. What the hell, French people.

      <em>I am about to do a wrong thing</em>  "est-ce que" is like a verbal question mark in French, devoid of any literal meaning, like when people say like, like, you know? and it makes no logical sense but it's understood to imply a question.  Alternatively you can tack on "n'est-ce pas?" as the end of your sentence, but doing this too much will mark you as one who has not mastered the art of inversion, which is basically "Verb-object?" and will probably lead to death by penny-farthing bicycle to the eye socket. <br/>
