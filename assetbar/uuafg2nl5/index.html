      Some things are just not worth knowing.  The link that achilleselbow provided is incontrovertible proof of this fact.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
More to the point, asking for the information when you could more easily look it up yourself is a way of expressing the opinion that the knowledge is of extremely low value.  See H.P. Grice's work on implicatures for clarification of this communication strategy.

      That's a good theory, but I don't think it holds in all cases. I tend to think that asking "what is that" is a phrase that is so commonly embedded in our culture and vocabulary, that it is often our first response. Remember, the phenomenon of instantly being able to look up any information you want within the same context in which you happen to spend most of your work and leisure time has only existed for a couple of years. In a generation, though, questions like "what is X" will cease to exist, and conversations will consist entirely of exchanging Wikipedia passages.

As much as I'd like to believe that, I'm pretty sure he gets with plenty of women, they're just never shown (which further illustrates the shallow and empty nature of his relations with them). There's Roast Beef's memories of watching Ray get it on in high school, as well as the "conchita" that shows herself out before Ray wakes up and takes six beershits. On the other hand, the fact that his attempt to try a new sexual position every day for a year hit some speed bumps shows that the truth is somewhere in between.

      Trying a new position every day often tends to run into more problems with trying to find legitimate positions that are different enough to really qualify. Otherwise you start saying that leaning over a chair is totally different from leaning over a sofa.

      So there are three homeless dudes sitting around their burning barrel, sharing stories and laughs.  The first hobo starts out, "Oh man the other night... the other night I found a bag of McDonald's just laying next to a garbage can.  There were two bic macs in there and fries man!  Holy shit I ate all night and it was so good." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The second bum replies, "Oh thats good, but I've one better.  I was slummin' around behind the liquor store and I found a half full bottle of vodka.  The good shit man!  Oh I got hella drunk for free, I'm still kinda drunk haha!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
The third vagrant tells them, "Oh you guys think you're lucky, I was down at the train tracks and I met up with this fine lady.  We hit it off right away and had sex all night long.  Fucked so hard and I didn't have to pay her!" <br/>

That having been said, I'm plenty accustomed to being the only person in any given room who enjoys her (well, besides my girl).

      I generally like folksy, harpy, ren-fair type things, and I'm pretty sure that anyone who doesn't like her mainly has issues with her voice. A friend described it as sounding like "if Kitty from That 70's Show were singing", and this was coming from someone that  <em>liked</em>  her. It's probably the kind of thing you could get used to if you wanted to make the effort (I don't want to make the effort).

      I'll admit that her voice was something that I had to get used to (Completely the opposite to my reaction to the CYHSY vocalist, oddly) but once you get past it, or even grow to like it like I did, her lyrics are basically the best thing since ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, of course MCR's first album is the best. But I kind of like what they tried with The Black Parade as well. Three Cheers falls to third for being largely mediocre, with only a couple of truly epic songs to make it a worthy addition to the discography.

      It's not being from history it's that there are so many that the odds tend not to favor them. <br/>

Tesla was quite the fellow I can assure you. In fact Edison's disgusting campaign to degrade him is part of the reason why I loathe Edison so much (also, it's a fact that Edison was a complete dick). Tesla was also friends with Mark Twain who was also most definitely the man.

      I'd just like to point on to the gentleman from Actualtauntland that I have always stood for the equal but sensible administration of yeses where needed and the cutting of government waste and kick-backs, and anyone with a discerning eye should be able to see where the distinction lies.  Would Mr. Taunt have preferred I voted Yes when Rep. Indeed proposed his infamous "Blind Yeses" bill, whereby families making under 50 yeses a year received the same amount of yeses as those making 100 Hell Yeses a year, as do the likes of Mr. Indeed?  Through my overhaul of the plan, those under the agreeable line (less than 30 yeses a year) would have received a minimum of 5 Hell Yeses per child while those making over 100 Emphatic Agreements a year received none.  Would Rep. Actual taunt  <em>also</em>  prefer I had voted on the Yes pay raise for this House?  Ladies and gentlemen, when I was a child, my father brought home an Apathetic Nod an hour from the Shrug Mill for 30 years of his life.  I know what it's like to live, not knowing where your next Sure will come from.  My policies have and always will make sure Yeses are distributed fairly and sensibly.

      The Gentleman from Onwater is making generalization for the purpose of muddying the issue. The records not only indicate that I voted against Blind issues all five times it was raised in the last congress-- I'll repeat that,  <strong>five times</strong> -- But that the representative from Onwater initially supported that issue until it became apparent that his home district would profit more from traditional appropriations. <br/> 
Need I remind this congress that the Honorable Representative from Onwater's father made an apathetic nod   <em>only until he bought that Shrug mill and became a Fuckyeah-ionarre? </em> . <br/> 
The Honorable Representative from Onwater's proposed Yestribution plan has only one flaw, Mr. Speaker: It can suck my balls. <br/>

      They're empty circles because, like all strippers, Polly is dead on the inside. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There was a time when she had dreams - oh yes - a happier time, a time spent imagining her name on a small yet pleasingly weighty hardback nestled on the shelf at Borders somewhere between Ansel Adams and Steve McCurry. She would live in the city, perhaps New York, in a loft/studio with high, vaulted ceilings and soft, ethereal light shining through the windows, the kind that embraces the curve of a hip or the slope of a cheekbone warmly. She would walk down the street every morning to her local coffee shop, frost dancing around her feet like playful spirits, and order a fancy drink - the kind made with free trade coffee beans and several different kinds of syrup. As she sipped, she would sigh contentedly, a peaceful grin playing across her face. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When that bitter, drunken college professor - the type who was never good enough to stand on his own two legs as an artist, the type filled with jealous rage - took her favorite landscape and, with a voice filled with derision and scorn, cut it to pieces in front of her classmates, she couldn't take it anymore. She found herself unable to frame a shot without hearing the echoing disdain for her sophomoric composition, the mockery of her subject choice a haunting mental chorus. She left school and, in order to pay off student loans, got a job as an "exotic dancer". At first, while she ground her thighs mechanically against degenerates dressed in filmy basketball shorts and smelling of stale beer and desperation, her mind would wander to expensive coffee, dancing snow, and that perfect, ephemeral light, her own personal paradise lost. The pain of what might have been burned at her psyche as if her very soul was on fire, until she locked it away, her dream fading into a distant memory, drowned by the ever-insistent beat of the club's PA system. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's why her eyes are empty circles.

I myself had close to that same hat in high school, feather and all. It might have been a peacock eye. I thought I looked a dork in it, tho. <br/>

      I still have a fine Stetson fedora.  It had a feather in the band when I bought it.  But I didn't like the way it looked, so I took it out before I wore the hat out or the shop. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't wear it too much lately, though.  I am rather tall, and I need a car with a lot of head room so I can wear it when I drive.  And the last three cars I have owned have had sunroofs, which take away just enough head room that I can't wear my hat while I drive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And it's just not the same if I have to take the hat off while I am in the car.  Not the same at all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The hat stares at me accusingly when I go into the closet.  It is quite disconcerting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Especially since it is a size 7 7/8.  It is fucking huge.

      I can't bring myself to stop. Sometimes there are occasional nuggets of joy. The idea that the clerks at the beanbag repair shop keep shouting in Hebrew on their cell phones really perfectly sells the image of the shop to me. It is exactly as it should be. <br/>

Also endorsing a farm subsidy check for ungrown crops. It made me wonder where Swartzwelder was with that one. After watching King Corn, however, I learned that that is no longer the process. We actually encourage overproduction now. Some people seem to think that going back to paying not to grow would be better.

      Perhaps you misunderstood my  <em><strong>What the fuck?</strong></em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was not, "What the fuck is an Escalade." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have, for quite some time, know what an Escalade is.  It is an obscene, gas-guzzling, road hog of a vehicle, almost exclusively driven by people who are totally incompetent to drive any car, much less a car as over-large and overpowered as an Escalade. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was, "What the fuck?  You insult me with the idea that I would ever drive an Escalade." <br/>

      Pidder panter would be the work of a piddler, twiddler, or twaddler so take your pick if that fits.  I have enjoyed him since I was helped along stanza by stanza by my teacher in 9th grade with "The Hollow Men."  "Prufrock" is my favorite as of now though.

      I did the same thing in my "Creative Writing" class in 10th grade a.k.a. incredibly regimented and only the teacher can tell you what's good class, and discovered Pablo Neruda ("The Word").  Not quite like being struck by lightning; more like putting your tongue on a 9 volt.

      I would say learn Spanish first because it's better in Spanish, then read Pablo Neruda.  It's actually more like licking, say, 10 9 volts.  Lick a 90 volt battery.  Or do both, I don't care.  My point is he's good but it's not a religious experience to read him.

      Sure, it's just I've seen translations ruin a good poem.  If you try to literally translate some of his work, it goes from sensual to forced.  Then in others, the translator gets creative and makes it his own horrible aberration.

      Now they look kind of like eyes, with the underlines being a giant, thick-lipped mouth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Alternatively, it is a deli sandwich with an with two toothpicks with olives on them (toothpicks now picture), or a slice of cake with decorative icing. <br/>

Actually, they might have looked like eyes even if the spacing had turned out correctly.  ASCII can be ambiguous somethings.  This may also be an argument against the underlining of boobs.

      Ayn Rand would probably claim that all the other wrestlers were doing it wrong and that she was the world's greatest expert on wrestling, despite never having gone to a single gym. Then she'd gather a bunch of muddle-headed acolytes and they would start their own gyms with important-sounding names, where they would gather to slap-fight while thinking that they were actually wrestling.

      It is entirely within my interests to instruct you to fuck yourself right now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rand herself, however, I don't think anyone will defend that she didn't have some amazingly serious problems and was largely a hypocrite of her own beliefs. She often took them to places where they no longer worked and were never intended in the first place.

      Yea, I suspected you were an Objectivist given your hatred of Kant. I'll give you a pass on it because unfortunately a lot of intelligent people who would otherwise be pretty good at philosophy but choose different career paths fall prey to her shit because it consists of cool and dramatic-sounding ultimatums, and it also helps people feel smugly superior to the shallow liberalism that is the norm on college campuses. I was enthralled with  <em>Anthem</em>  in eighth grade, but fortunately discovered Nietzsche shortly after, and I haven't looked back.

      Nah, I'm more of a small-l libertarian. Which isn't entirely a  <em>philosophical</em> , but it's close enough without getting into a Thing. I had my Rand phase in high school, but even then I was picking apart the better bits and realizing that there were serious flaws in various other parts. I just don't subscribe to the wholesale dismissal that seems to be so popular these days. If anything go after the weird neo-con pricks who took over most of Objectivism. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nietzsche is definitely the much better place to go for solid individualist philosophy, but again some people take it way too far and end up in crazytown.

      Not always. I much prefer perky to flabby. Too often large breasts are soft and formless and seem prone to sagging. I'd much rather have a decently-sized breast than a large one. A nice pert handful that can at least aspire to support itself a little bit and doesn't require a bra to be forced into a pleasing shape.

Maybe he actually has a huge crush on you and was hoping you'd ask to go to the dance too, but you didn't even think of it until the next morning and now you're trying desperately to get her to call you back but she wont because you're just an asshole.

      You'll have to ask Brecht.  Since you're studying German, you really owe it to yourself to hear  <em>Die Dreigroschenoper</em>  (The Three-Penny Opera) in German.  Hella better than the lame English translation.

      Yeah, that album is cool.  I used to have it on vinyl but it got sat on and spilled on and god knows what all else and now it is just a sad reminder of the music that used to be listen-to-able from it.  Totally with you on the bad rep Mack the Knife has from Bobby Darin et al.  But I will say this: I do think the Doors do a good job with that Whiskey song (oh, don't ask why...)

      "Franz Woyzeck, a lowly soldier stationed in a provincial German town, is the father of an illegitimate child by his mistress Marie. Woyzeck earns extra money for his family by performing menial jobs for the Captain and agreeing to take part in medical experiments conducted by the Doctor. As one of these experiments, the Doctor tells Woyzeck he must eat nothing but peas. It is obvious that Woyzeck's mental health is breaking down and he begins to experience a series of apocalyptic visions. Meanwhile, Marie grows tired of Woyzeck and turns her attentions to a handsome drum major, who in an ambiguous scene taking place in Marie's bedroom, arguably rapes her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
With his jealous suspicions growing, Woyzeck confronts the drum major, who beats him up and humiliates him. Finally, Woyzeck stabs Marie to death by a pond. While a third act trial is claimed by some to have been part of the original conception, the fragment as left by B√ºchner ends with Woyzeck disposing of the knife in the pond, and most renditions extrapolate this with him drowning while trying to clean himself of the blood after having dumped the knife in deep waters."

      Excellent. Finally people acknowledge my fundamental awesomeness. <br/>

My girlfriend was also a biology major though. She is not very good at stripping. I think she has no sense of rhythm as she basically just cannot dance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's a very Seinfeld sort of thing. She wants to dance at various times but cannot comprehend how terrible she is nor does she know enough shame to stop even when told how bad she is. <br/>

At least she's been taking stripping lessons. That has been yielding some improvement.

      Be that as it may, I will maintain that anyone who "enjoys" getting naked in front of a crowd and gyrating on the laps of strangers who are most likely smelly and of low mind cannot possibly be a person that is worth knowing in any fashion other than the biblical one.

      Interestingly I was reading  <em>Acid Test</em>  at the same time that I was reading Hunter S. Thompson's  <em>Hell's Angels</em> . The crossover when both books discuss attending the same party was kind of weird. <br/>

On the other hand it helped to put everything in a greater context for what was happening in this area at the time. <br/>

      Allow me to diverge here for a moment and state how once again this is proof of how LA doesn't matter. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Beats, Hippies, Punks, Gay Rights... these were important in San Francisco and New York primarily. We were the two major cities for them all. LA never really mattered much in any of them. Even if we want to move forward into the modern era of the geek/Internet subculture it is along a SF/NY axis primarily. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We need to get a bit more respect from the world at large. We've been behind just about every major cultural movement of the past half century.

      While you have a bit of a point I doubt that people are thinking of Denver when they think of Beats. I doubt that most people ever think of Denver aside from having layovers. It is basically a lot like Atlanta in that regard, but it is not as bad as Atlanta. Atlanta is terrible.

      If you look good enough, you can twirl it on stage too.  The money's not nearly as good, unless you're serious beefcake and get into something like Chippendale's.  This is one of the few areas in which the pay differential favors women.

      So 2 extreme stories on this one: <br/> 
1. I once met a stripper who had a Shakespeare quote tattooed up the inside of her forearm.  I asked her about it, and we proceeded to have an hour long discussion of the bard in the club.  I gave her the rest of my cash and called it a night.  <br/> 
2. In an entirely different strip club, I watched the most beautiful woman in the place wander aimlessly around the stage because she was ridiculously high.  She had no idea where she was nor what she was doing.  I'm quite sure the owner of the club made more money from her after the club closed. <br/>

I don't know what this says about me or strippers.  You are welcome to your own conclusions.

Cornelius deserves a lady bear friend, but it disappoints me that Beef and Molly have almost disappeared since their wedding (yes, I know, they should show up at this dinner, but still) -- plus her eyes creep me out a little.

      Maybe Cornelius will die and get scolded by his dear Iris Gambol, come back and have to break up with Polly, breaking her heart and losing respect among the guys, then Teodor will finally get laid on the rebound, administering the final dose of ignominy to Cornelius, and we'll have a tragic tension between Polly and Cornelius forever after.   <br/>

      She is supportive and innoffensive, and that is precisely the problem. The female characters ought be a challange, rather than a foil, to their counterpart's sensibilities. Or even better, have dynamics that exist outside of them. I mean, Pat got Rod, didn't he?

      C'mon.  Give her a chance. <br/> 
Maybe Onstad wanted to bring Tina back due to the criticism of the lack of female characters, but after everyone moaned about her (I guess you were justified), he dumped her and decided to go with a clean slate: Polly.  She is a nice girl.  Unrealistic?  Any more unrealistic than a girl from 16th (or something) century being skilled with computers and coming back from Heaven to be with Beef?  C'mon.  She seems nice enough, and she is intelligent.  Give her time, and maybe she'll develop her own unique personality.  All we have are like six strips to go on at this point.

      I have always thought that you only capitalize after a colon if whatever comes after could stand on its own as a sentence.  Which is why I thought your non-capitalization was correct, but I couldn't tell if it was on purpose ...  Now I know that you subscribe to a much broader rule of non-capitalization.  I will have to think about this.  I'll get back to you.

I'm gonna be here to take you through up to the drive time hour when Manic Max and the Kommute Krew will take over to rock you all the way home on our Five O'Clock Cock Rock Block, but for now here's Journey with "Any Way You Want It".

      It's 5:24 now. The last bits of sun have ventured over the horizon and as I'm maybe a mile or so away from the beach it is now entirely night in both the Bay Area and the country. You did not succeed Mr. Onstad. Maybe giving us such precise times to expect is a bad thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize this is hard to do, but I'd say that building up a buffer first is necessary and then maybe we could get a more consistent schedule. Lots of other strips manage to come out on time every week without fail.

      It's this god damn touring and Dark Horse shit.  And also the dang long ass arc-comics (the comics within the arc).  I honestly wouldn't mind a Phillipe/ Lie-Bot or Ray and Beef on the couch every other day.  Those are usually the highest rated anyway.

      I know that traffic reporting exists here, but I ignore it because 1)I never leave the city 2)driving in the city is basically a grim joke because even if you manage to get somewhere despite the traffic and horrible street planning you'll never find anywhere to park unless you're the sort who's OK with paying $15 to park for an hour or two in which case you can go fuck yourself 3)traffic reporting here seems like it would be best served with just pointing at you an laughing for even deigning to ask the question; it is always terrible and rush hour lasts from about 4 PM to at least 7 PM. I see rush hour traffic even on weekends.

      We had one of those too.  It died.  But it was in Connecticut anyway so the signal sucked mostly and it was dumb because its playlist was basically: Motley Crue > Posion > Ozzy Osborne > AC/DC > Posion > Twisted Sister (guess what song) > Led Zeppelin > Van Halen > Motley Crue, repeat.

      I currently listen to 107.7 The Bone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Apparently there used to be a rock/classic rock station in the area for a long time named KUM although I forget the full call sign. Apparently there were ads about "Don't touch that dial... it's got KUM on it!" and "Wake up with KUM in your ear!". Juvenile, yes, but I can still desire to laugh at them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Actually, we apparently used to have some really great radio stations around here, but they've all been bought out and reformatted and there's very little left. I try to listen to KUSF, but tons of hills and a small-wattage college station are not a good combination.

      True, but DSB has become a bit too popular lately. Also "Any Way You Want It" is an acknowledged party anthem that was good enough for Rodney Dangerfield and basically signals "we are partying now". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had to deal with "When the Lights Go Down In the City" the other day. Be glad it doesn't come to that. It was also kinda weird because the song is about  <em>this city</em>  (which was also built on Rock and Roll which, while generally not a very good thing, is probably because a lot of it is already built on landfill and with all the earthquakes that's very structurally unsound so Rock and Roll is a bit of an improvement in unsound foundation materials) and while I was driving at night it is never really more than kinda dusk around here due to all of the streetlights. We have hella light pollution.

      I'm just saying that since Family Guy it has been, well, a bit tainted by people. I still like it, but it has experienced a recent surge in popularity. <br/>

Perhaps switching to "The Final Countdown" is advised? If anything that's merely connected to Arrested Development and that isn't anything to be ashamed of.

      This is the sort of  <em>anal-retentive mathematician</em>  question I can answer for you. <br/>

The afternoon lasts from 12:00:01 until 6:00. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At 6:00:01 it becomes evening, and remains so until 9:00. <br/> 
 <br/> 
9:00:01 until midnight, it is night. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One second after midnight, it becomes morning, which remains in effect until noon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And we start all over again. <br/>

As on a previous thread, your regional definitions may vary.  And arguing about it is  <em>futilitarian.</em> <br/>

      I have long claimed we need a new time system. Not some idiotic decimal time either, just some improvements to how it doesn't make a lot of sense now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
First we move everything by six hours. A new day will now start at 1:00 AM which will occur at the present 6 AM. This is Morning and will continue until 6 AM which will be our current noon. After 6 AM is afternoon through 12:59 AM after which Night starts at 1:00 PM. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All AM times are day and all PM times are night. 12 is part of the rest of the sequence and will not switch weirdly. So no 12 AM really being morning and 12 PM being noon which is confusing and weird. Morning starts at what is roughly dawn and evening starts at roughly dusk. This is the ideal system.

      I know that's why it is so sad.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I watched her do it twice, once by asking our head manager to do it and once doing it herself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the record, she did come to me and told me to go talk to a manager, and I did but only because something similar happened before and it was a creepy raper dude (like he was stalking ladies in the parking lot) so I went to one of the assistant managers and she said that there wasn't really anything we could do, and it wasn't worth it. Shortly after our head manager came out, talked to the guy, and then the guy left. And then the fucking Salvation Army lady fucking walks over to this guy getting his bike and points out that she got the homeless guy kicked out of the parking lot... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I felt so horribly bad about it...
