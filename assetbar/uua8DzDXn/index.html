Just a heads up -  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101425/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=10232008">this popular webcomic</a>  has essentially outlined vandalism to this page, which at least one user has already inserted (see  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101425/https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=What_Happened&amp;diff=247286053&amp;oldid=246909049">this diff</a> ).

      Quite likely. I want to further stress the fundamentally working-class nature of that pun. It is a pun for a working man. No, it's not as clever or enjoyable as the well-crafted puns enjoyed by elitists like myself, but I suspect that an honest tradesman can appreciate it and, in some small way, believe that there is still good and value in the language. This is the pun for a man who may or may not own a truck, not someone who most definitely would never own a truck. At the same time, it is above the level of someone who most certainly owns a truck and would insult your heritage and sexual orientation for even implying that he might not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But that sort of person is not often fond of puns to begin with. They are an abomination.

      I always liked him too. . . . for more than one reason.  I'm not musically savvy, so I can't judge how good of a drummer he is.  But I heard that in all the years of the Beatles, he only messed up six times, or something . .. something like that . .. I don't know, it sounds a little unbelievable.  But anyways, he always seemed very loyal to the group, and had no ego really.  I mean, I don't think he ever really got in any fights about the songs, or whatever.  HE helped out when he could, and such.   <br/>

      I know it's a popular stance to ignore Ringo, and in many ways I do, as well. But the man reinvented the rock drum fill. I'm not saying it was the flashiest or the most technically difficult, but that shit was, for lack of a better descriptor,  <em>tasty</em>  in a way that no one had before mastered to such an extent. I don't know how much the average non-drummer thinks about the fills that he or she hears in post-Beatles pop, but just keep in mind that they wouldn't be the same without everyone's favorite target of rock ridicule.

      That depends. What about "Greaser" bassists or people who try to dress and act like 1950s hollywood stereotypes, today? Weirdest. Subculture. Ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway they are usually that low, or that funny. I "base" this assumption on the statistical high percentage of bass players who start relationships after fucking drunk girls (3 for 3 so far, one of them being my airport rendevous chick, the others just being occasions I knew about through the grapevine).

      Dude, I hate fooker as much as anyone, but to be fair I have to point out that you all have been dangling this thread about bass and bassists so tantalizingly in front of him all day. Knowing full well that he has nothing else to say about anything, how can you reasonably expect him to be able to resist? We just need to understand that if anyone mentions bassists, airports or awkward oral sex on this board he  <em>will</em>  be there with his two cents. Like how if you shit on your rug your dog  <em>will</em>  try to eat it. It's up to all of us to keep that from happening. <br/>

      I don't think faces entirely count. You can see a face anywhere. There isn't a lot of urge to get women to remove their masks and veils so you can see their hot naked faces. I get where you're coming from and respect it, I just don't think it's really germane. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For me it's important that everything be acceptable. I can't take this stuff just piecemeal. I mean, yes, I'm largely a breast man, but I can also appreciate some nice legs and a bad ass could just spoil the whole deal. I guess you could call me a "package man".

      I get the basics and applaud you on them, but I'm still a tad confused on the specifics. Are you not gay? Are you implying that I am not gay (many thanks, but I already knew this)? Was my statement not "gay" or something? I'm confused. <br/>

      As someone who has often made big stands about hating my current country (who has since decided that this country ain't half bad at all, mind you) let me just stick up for people who are unhappy with their country and such. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's pretty much hard to leave the United States, the only country with which I have experience.  You have to have a job lined up in your foreign country of choice, and specifically with Canada, it is has to be a job that they can't easily find a Canadian to do.  Emigrating is a lot tougher than people seem to think.  If it were as simple as loving it or leaving it, I think a lot of people would've, in fact, left.  Not that I agree with that sentiment, but back a few years ago when I was a little more...simple in my vitriol, I found out leaving a country is a lot harder than saying you'll do it.

      Don't hate your country.  Hate your government, or popular culture, or military agenda, or whatever is shitty wherever you live.  Your country are your peers.  The are the people that you have to share this shitty experience with.  If anything, you should work together with your country to change those things you don't like.

      You have a valid point and I can agree with it. The greater problem is that I really loathe most of my peers. They are the reason that this country is largely fucked-up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The country on the whole, however, I have no real feelings for nor do I think anyone should. Try to care about making things better, but steer well clear of the nationalism. Basically every country is more or less equally fucked some are just fucked in slightly different ways.

      How is a thong going to help this woman whose ass hangs down onto the back of her thighs? <br/> 
 <br/> 
In my opinion, the panty lines help immensely by making it seem as if her ass actually stops at the top of her legs, instead of continuing on far past any aesthetic boundary.

      I had a dream that my dad was eating Cheetos (no one in my family eats Cheetos) and somehow managed to make a huge orange stain no less than 2 feet in diameter on a new carpet upstairs. He then went down to the laundry room cabinet in search of carpet cleaner, but only found tons of bubblewrap and hoodia flavored drink mixes in place of the cleaner. He then asked my mom, frustrated, where the carpet cleaner was and she informed him that she had moved it to the basement to make room for the bubblewrap/diet drinks. My dad got really pissed and stomped downstairs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then I woke up. <br/>

Anybody care to illuminate what the FUCK is going on in my head? Thanks.

      This is actually quite clear: <br/> 
 <br/> 
You need to buy a scratch-off lottery ticket, but don't scratch it off.  Give it to the first homeless man you see. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then buy four bottles of men's cologne, four different brands, all cheap.  Blend them, two parts from the first bottle, three parts from the second bottle, five parts from the third bottle, and one part from the fourth bottle.  Put a very small amount of the mixture on each wrist. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Go to the nearest casino.  Give a very large tip to the second cocktail waitress.  Put a dollar token into the correct slot machine, and you will win the jackpot. <br/> <br/> <br/> I wish I could have a dream that was this easy to interpret.

      OK, OK. This has been fun, but now I have to say that, yes, I was going too far in saying what I said about web comics. I was feeling feisty, I guess. "Complete shit" was overly harsh. It  <em>was</em>  a rant and it  <em>was</em>  (to an extent) based on an incorrect assumption. I spent last night and today checking out all of the comics mentioned above and this (whether or not anybody gives two fucks) is what I thought: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dinosaur Comics - Funny, but does not properly utilize the medium. If you're a good writer but can't be bothered with actual comic art, why not just be a writer? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perry Bible Fellowship - Completely good. I will now read this comic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Daisy Owl - Wouldn't be out of place in any newspaper comics section. It would be the best one there, but would still fit right in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Truck Bearing Kibble - Obviously painstakingly rendered art unfortunately ends up looking like a Hallmark card. That wouldn't be such a big deal if it were any more than just vaguely interesting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thingpart - Pretty good, actually. Not great, but certainly far from "complete shit." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Penny Arcade - Really?  <em>Really?</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sam and Fuzzy - I am not a 15-year-old girl. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sinfest - See above review of Daisy Owl, minus the vague half-compliment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Irregular Webcomic - Not a comic. Disqualified. <br/> 
 <br/> 
LUCID TV - Very impressed. I love the style of the art and was continually surprised by the path of the humor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, ultimately the only one that I plan on returning to on a regular basis will be P.B.F. But point taken. There are some good things out there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All that having been said, I would hope that we all can at least agree that while Achewood may not be the  <em>only</em>  good web comic, it is the best by a ridiculous margin.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes?

      My question is why does everyone hate Dinosaur Comics for some reason? I'll admit Ryan North is insanely loquacious but that's what makes it funny! The early stuff was just him painfully trying to wedge in the fact that it's the same panel of clip art every time but about midway through he just kinda says FUCK IT and that's the truly bizarre stuff came about. Like when he added the entire Angriest Dog In The World universe into his own universe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously it takes a while but it grows on you. <br/>

Sje just drop the xkcd stuff you are like an evangelist at a Christopher Hitchens seminar, you are well meaning but no one will listen to your message.

      Dresden Codak has great art, but I'm not certain how you'll feel about the rest of it. It just got done with a very lengthy piece that... well, probably was not to everyone's tastes. Still, it reminds me heavily of the wonderful A Lesson Is Learned, But the Damage is Irreversible of which it once did a tribute strip.

      I basically went with a top 3 "most likely to appeal to someone who likes Achewood" at least in my opinion. <br/>

I do read Girl Genius, as well as about a couple dozen others (eg. Skin Horse, Gunnerkrigg Court, Overcompensating/Wigu, Wonderella) on a regular basis but considering he apparently took the time to read every suggestion it probably wins not to overwhelm him.

2) you are shopping at Wal-Mart <br/>

      Eww... you barbarian. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sports are basically awfulness distilled down into an activity that is not just having sex with a nasty girl wearing trashy sweat pants with something written on the ass that she has been convinced to pay far too much for because some idiot "designer" decided that ugly clothes are cool because stupid people were already wearing them and looking exceptionally ugly doing so and that made it "street". <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Street" just about anything (not including food, of course) is generally the worst that you can get next to sports.

      Nope. I won't even go out into the yard without showering. The only possible exception is if today is a street sweeping day and you forgot to move the car. Then the possibility of an expensive ticket allows you a brief pass to go move the car across the street and nothing else.

      Well if it wasn't stupid it wouldn't be trendy. It would be "classic" and it wouldn't need to be justified. Trendy is just the explanation for why people are doing something stupid because they briefly think it's interesting and haven't yet realized that it isn't and may actually be incredibly stupid. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've definitely had enough of girls wearing ugly tight pants and pulling up their ugly boots over them. <br/>

Sometimes the skirt and tights look can work. I think we see a lot more of it though because it's almost never quite warm enough to wear skirts otherwise.

Some ladies do not mind this. Some ladies like to be present. Some ladies like to join in and/or get their own lap dances. These are the best of ladies. <br/>

      During my time as a bouncer in a gentleman's cabaret, I noted that many married/long term couples came in.  My theory on this was that the atmosphere and scantily (un)clad women mentally "charged the batteries" for furious sex later.  If there was any solicitation by them to rendezvous later that night after we closed up with any of the ladies, I never knew it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As to why Molly "let" Beef go out...considering his near-crippling bouts of depression, I think she'd go for almost  <em>anything</em>  that would allow the poor guy to relax. It either that, or him screaming at moths or worrying about dead children (sigh)  <strong><em>again</em></strong> . <br/>

Postscript: As I went to hit "Post", David Rose's "The Stripper" came up on random shuffle on my computer.  I think my lappy is trying to tell me something.

But yeah, Molly doesn't seem the jealous type. I don't understand it myself. I've got no problems if she wants to check out other guys (and yet, she seemingly has no interest in this... I find that more disturbing) and it's rather complimentary when other guys check her out.

      "Open a can of whoopass"  <em>is</em>  a very Oklahoma kind of thing to say. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ironically, even though I have spent the majority of my 46 years in Oklahoma, I first heard this phrase used in Texas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Although I have heard it subsequently many time in Oklahoma. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Open up a can of dumbass" is a term quite  <em>appropriate</em>  for Oklahoma though.  It should probably be our state motto.

      Really? I think my computer dictionary has a typo then - puts it in the wrong conjugation. My hard-copy dictionary has it right for what you're saying (and I'm more inclined to believe that and you... the digital one has been a bit sketchy before). <br/> 
 <br/> 
'course, had I been fully awake and thinking (my Latin teacher would cringe to see what I wrote, but then again, I've never been any good at English to Latin, only the converse), I would have translated it in the subjunctive to show ability... probably a bit more threatening and in line with the English connotation. :D

      Nothing personal. Puns killed my family and left me for dead at the age of four. Had to make my way through the world as a coke mule. You know, no one expects a little kid. Swore to exterminate puns on my ninth birthday. Nothing personal at all, just have to wipe puns from the face of the earth. Hired in 2005 by Congressional anti-pun lobbyists to serve as a figurehead of the anti-pun movement after the McCoulley Anti Pun Act failed to make it out of the House again. Started a splinter group to take things into my own hands and exterminate puns while waiting for the government to catch up. If I get caught, I have faith I'll be pardoned once my bill becomes a law and my crimes are legalized. Nothing personal. Just hate puns. <br/>

      I always wondered how you could dance or strip in those. I mean, you don't have any balance and I'd expect that getting clothing off over them would be a problem as thing with small straps and such would tend to catch on the heel portion. <br/>

Sometimes I have to admit that strippers have valid skills that the rest of us are simply not capable of. We really ought to learn to appreciate the skill of top notch strippers.

      Listen, this is what just happened. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I came on to the latest comic thinking, I want to get involved in whatever's going on on Assetbar today, but obviously there are like fucktons of comics, so I thought okay I want to find really good comments and have discussions with those comments, so I opend up the "find" bar on Safari and typed in "fly" and like this comment was the ONLY ONE with the word fly in it. Before I did that I typed in "rad" but there were like eight results, and a couple of them were just drskradley's username, and I was all like SCREW THAT I CAN'T MAKE A DECISION OUT OF EIGHT RESULTS TO JOIN IN A CONVRSATION, so I picked a new word and that word was "fly" as I have mentioned, which lead me here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So the thing is, after this whole entire backstory, I should maybe actually have something of relevance to say. But I bloody don't. So this is weaksauce. Ummm. Okay. Something interesting. Okay how's this. On the cab ride home, my flatmate started talking whale (a la Finding Nemo) to the driver. This was basically the most hilarious thing to happen ever and I hope whoever reads this appreciates the hilarity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And also appreciates the fact that I am like so incredibly drunk that I think this entire comment is completely a good idea. Oh man. Hahahahahahahaha. Lames a plenty? Oh maybe. There is a smallish part of my brain saying "stop don't post this comment you are basically a travesty when drunk and there is no reason that all of Assetbar should know" but then there is a much bigger part that is just going "AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA EVERYTHING IS HILARIOUS" and i am inclined to agree with that part, because basically the thing is, everything is hilarious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Listen, I'm going to click "post" before this gets any longer.

Well.  I asked my friend (who is a girl) if she is a feminist.  She said "No!" quite emphatically, expressing annoyance to women who assume that all men are pigs.  Apparently a lot of people believe that a feminist is one who thinks women are better than men or should be treated better.  No.  They should be treated the same.

      This is a fundamental problem with Threadless. Sometimes there are great shirts and more often there is a lot of crap. I cannot see how anyone votes for or selects the terrible shirts, but that is the way it sometimes goes. These things tend to go in cycles though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think I have about 13 or 14 of their shirts, but it took a lengthy period of time checking out what's available each week. I can't think of anything that I had any real interest in showing up within the past nine months or so.

      Lots of their shirts would be better as just random pictures but not really as T-shirts.  It's a bigger problem with Snorg, if anyone is familiar with that site.

      That is perhaps  <em>the best reason</em>  for being in love with someone.  You never have to worry that s/he will balk at something you know will be completely mad rutty, but will make you both look like jerks.

Anyway.  I thought that Mario would be on the shirt.  But I still understand your flabbergastedness.  It should be more recognizable. <br/> 
Apparently in New York, they call him Mary-o.  And they laugh at us for calling him Mah-rio.

      The name actually has a degree of sense behind it. Wario's name, as a pun, actually works in multiple languages. In English and, well, any other language that uses the Roman alphabet, naturally the "W" gives the impression of him being an inverse Mario. But in Japanese, the "Wa" syllable is actually derived from the ikeyoshi "warui", meaning evil. Thus Waluigi might seem like a stupid name to us gaijin, but it makes a degree more sense to the Japanese.

      It's basically a supergroup formed after The Blood Brothers and Pretty Girls Make Graves both broke up. So if you don't like The Blood Brothers (their lead vocalist is the lead vocalist for JL) you probably won't like Jaguar Love.

      Let me second the recommendation of The Blood Brothers. If it wasn't for the fact that they ended up heralding a generation of mall screamo that ended up becoming more popular than them, they would be SO FUCKING BIG RIGHT NOW. They are essentially the screamo version of Cap'n Jazz (one of the earliest known emo bands) in the sense that they did so right what their followers did so wrong. <br/>

PGMG is ok but TBB is awesome! Warning if you do not like high pitched male vocals you will not enjoy this.

      if you don't want anything ironic hipster or """funny""" just look for something plain but cut well.  Everyone hates them, but I just don't care  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101425/https://store.americanapparel.net/men-short-sleeves---t-shirts.html">their men's stuff is very nice</a> , but underappreciated.

A warning: If you are not gay, you are going to be a little put off by the models.  Don't worry, as long as you aren't getting a V-Neck that goes down to your nipples, the shirts won't make you look gay. <br/>

      I thought the boys at Hecci's Crystal City were way cuter.  I didn't read any of these guys as particularly gay (and after all these years, the radar is fairly fine-tuned). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Straight guys, don't worry about some article of clothing making you 'look gay.'  Doesn't generally work that way, for one.  Even if it did (or something else attracts attention), the worst you may have to face is a bit of unwanted attention.  It's not like we're gonna knock you down and fuck you.  Outside of prison, that's pretty much a straight thing, ya know?

      Even if he is.  I hate those flour sack baggy rags they wear these days.  I much preferred the short shorts they wore in the '70s and earlier '80s.  Too gay, I suppose, for the modern manly man.  (The current style is admittedly less restrictive, but the old one didn't seem to hold the game back any.)

      Ehh... I find the cut of their shirts a bit unpleasant. For one they tend to be rather slim so unless you're in rather good shape it's not going to work. Also I feel that the sleeves tend to be cut in a bit too much and they just feel unpleasant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I own a few due to other people printing on them, but I'm generally strongly in opposition to the cut that they prefer. It is fundamentally a hipster cut.

      My claim is that they feel profoundly uncomfortable and if you're not particularly slim they don't fit very well. It has nothing to do with style. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said I tend to prefer classic styles to "the style of today". If something is good it is always good. It is not a fad. It is not a trend. It does not ever come into style or go out of style. If something must be justified by saying that it is the style then it is bad and will be quickly revealed as such. It has no basis for claiming to be good other than "other people are doing it".

      Many strips clubs are 24 hours. I've often wondered about the people working on some of the off shifts. If you're not paying stage fees is it easier because you can kind of just slack off and not really do anything or is it tougher? Do you have to pay a lot more attention to the only couple of people in there? Is it just a chance to pull out C-list or new girls just learning the ropes of how to dance? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Damn. Now I think I need to make a trip to the Lusty Lady at 7 AM or so on a weekday. I wonder what the truly worst time is though. I could see some people maybe dropping in a bit before work or such and possibly around lunch or so... I wonder when it's the absolute slowest.

      The off-times usually are populated by regulars, the kinds of people who fall in love with them, and buy them Lexuses.   Generally, the ones working at that time are the older, saltier strippers who have to pick up their kids by the late afternoon.  I think new hires go on pretty much whenever, because a lot of the appeal for a stripper is in her being a 'new face' to returning customers, much more than her dance ability.  Look at the success of "amateur nights" which are most often entered by strippers from other clubs.  I guess not every soccer cougar and sorority sister is open to the idea of being leered at for pennies on the dollar.  Who knew?

      For my youngest brother's birthday I devised that I should bake a cake, one that would celebrate his love of gaming. No baker could provision the proper nutrition requirements (their instance on margarine over the more proper butter left me gasping in horror) so I set forth to construct a marvelous vanilla cake, with butter cream frosting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pounds of butter, sugar, eggs, flour, milk, baking soda, and pure vanilla met their fate under skillful whisking. Fluffed egg whites, carefully folded, a batter so perfect that there was no question in my mind - I had constructed a cake of unequalled deliciousness. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Into the oven it went, and away I went for the period of thirty minutes, during which time I amused myself on the lightning box. Returning, I found, to my horror, the ruins of my oven (the bottom now coated in a sickly mixture of burnt and still-liquid cake) and my cake - burnt to a crisp on the top, still liquid underneath. Peeling off the top layer, I dialed back the temperature, hoping against hope for a second chance... <br/> 
 <br/> 
...to no avail... <br/> 
 <br/> 
The product I now received from my oven was twisted and sick, a mockery of cake. Gone was the sweetness of the batter, gone was the airy texture and buttery goodness. Instead, somehow, something with enough sugars and fats to provide cardiac arrest to all but the bravest of men was now a salty, hard, flavorless pile of failure.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Back to the store I went, now at 2am, rushing to the only place open. A quick glance through the aisles for the least toxic boxed mix, and back home, into a bowl, under the wisk, and into the oven... thirty minutes later a pair of perfect 8" circle cakes greeted me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I returned to the task of icing, but by now my perfect butter cream was runny. There was no hope of constructing my grand plan (a Master Chief, as the kids say, complete with alien guns and other such foolishness). Instead it was a rudimentry "X", and this too ran, leaving a mishappen pile of icing in its wake. Steadying my nerves, I put the thing in the fridge, and hoped for the best. <br/> 
 <br/> 
- <br/> 
 <br/> 
And as Philipe was served horror-cakes in the place of Mickey Mouse, so too will I deliver an Xbox cake that, for all the world, may as well have a red-ring. A box-flavored nightmare, complimented by the frosting of the gods, in a design that would not muster a passing grade in second grade art class. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is my fail cake: <br/>

      aw man, it is totally the thought that counts.  Really, I've seen much worse done by people being paid to bake cakes, so don't feel too bad.   <br/>

You know what?  Good for you!  Really!  I can't stand it when a person just goes to a Walmart and buys a cake.  That always eemed to be the most depressing thing.  Like, I would rather you bake me a cake instead of feeding me what is basically ipecac syrup in box form from a gas station tended by a former stripper with a tattoo on her neck (she's going to community college though, so she's movin' on up).   <br/> 
I mean, I always thought it was a case of child abuse to buy a cake from a store.  If you are too busy to build a Betty Crocker, then you are too busy to have a kid. <br/>

      I will give you a pat on the head for trying the real cake.  People never appreciate how fucking hard a really nice cake can be.  Or how tricky stable, nonrockhard buttercream can be.  I bake like crazy, and my first three cakes of any given genre are not good.  I toss the first one every time (a genois without properly unclumped flour will make your bowels quiver). <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are a toughguy, and worthy of respect.  I suggest you try a good ten more times, without time restraints.  Homemade cakes taste much better.  I will point out that cake-mix-cakes are going to be fluffier, and easier to dress up.  They have access to leavening agents you cannot even pronounce.

      Strips like this are why I read Achewood. The dialogue between Ray and Beef is so charming I find myself jacking it in a pathetic attempt to recreate it sometimes. Sometimes the comics are not so good because Mr. Onstad is trying to make a living, but this one makes up for weeks of time-stressed work.

      I was disappointed to see Scott McClellan's book, "What Happened" already occupies this spot in Wikipedia. It appears some disambiguation might be needed. Unless we can find a way to paste the image of Connie leaving with the stripper onto the book cover. Make it happen, Assetbar.
