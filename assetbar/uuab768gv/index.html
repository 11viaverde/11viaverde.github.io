      What makes this strip amusing is that it's one of the few strips that reminds me of the fact that Ray is, indeed, a cat (note his eyes in the 7th panel), along with the leaping episode in GOF.

His glasses are lifted on one other occasion but, of course, he's sold his eyes.

      Notice that he's got the same lack of punctuation as Roast Beef? <br/> 
 <br/> 
If we can get a tape recording of him speaking, then we'd have a better idea of how Beef speaks. Although "a soft, semi-monotone" would probably fit the bill.

      Robert Johnson died of Strychnine poisoning.  It was well known that he would drink anything given to him at the bar, despite the better advice of friends like Charlie Patton.  It was also well-known that he slept with lots of women - some of whom had husbands.  In the end, somebody slipped him a Rat poison cocktail. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ten to twenty minutes after exposure, the body's muscles begin to spasm, starting with the head and neck. The spasms then spread to every muscle in the body, with nearly continuous convulsions, and get worse at the slightest stimulus. The convulsions progress, increasing in intensity and frequency until the backbone arches continually. Death comes from asphyxiation caused by paralysis of the neural pathways that control breathing, or by exhaustion from the convulsions. The subject will die within 2%u20133 hours after exposure. At the point of death, the body "freezes" immediately, even in the middle of a convulsion, resulting in instantaneous rigor mortis. (wikipedia)

      That is regarded as urban legend. Strychnine is extremely bitter according to toxicologists and is fatal within hours, not days.  <br/> 
 In the 70's, it was allegedly used in minute quantities to give some LSD batches a boost. I know this.

      I think that's an urban legend, same as the one about LSD 'breaking down' into strychnine when old or maltreated (or that strychnine is used as a catalyst in the production of acid). <br/>

I read in a few places that no amount of strychnine has ever been found in tested/seized LSD.
