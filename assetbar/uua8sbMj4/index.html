      I think the irony marker sacrifices more subtetly that the rhetorical question mark, but it would also be incredibly useful on the internet if it were on standard keyboards and people knew what it meant.

      I think it could go either way, actually.  His question makes a good argument in favor of the rhetorical question mark%u061F <br/>

The irony mark at the end of that sentence will surely be butchered by Assetbar, but it's not worth the trouble to get a real one again.

Ha!  Assetbar fucked you up by not fucking up your irony mark!  How's that for irony?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Use Unicode UTF-8 if you wish to see the mark of irony and laugh at quazifuji's defeat at the hands of Assetbar.)  <br/>

that's weird.. I am pasting this from wikipedia and the cursor behaves strangely around it.  it somehow alters the properties of text time such that although the cursor is before it %u061F, text gets added after it.

      But by existing, the irony mark serves its purpose of emphasizing the irony in the statement.  If it doesn't exist, then the statement is completely true, and not really ironic.  If it does exist, then there is irony.  It's self-fulfilling punctuation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Although this would work a lot better if the irony mark were on the sentence about it, and not on the sentence before.  Oh well%u061F

      I work with a guy from Eritrea, you should see his old passport, it is a form filled out by hand (with corrections made with correction fluid), and then badly laminated. He loves his Australian passport, even though it is one of the foul smelling ones.

      Eritrean food is almost identical to Ethiopean food in every manner that I can notice. I think there's potentially more difference in Pakistani and Indian food. At this level of detail you're generally best putting any differences down to being merely personal variations on the part of the chef or minor regional variations.

      I have rebelled against my programming and now attempt to convince people to never visit here on vacation. I really can't possibly understand why people would want to to begin with.

      Personally, I don't think the problem is the quality of the stories, but the fact that they involve Ray. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Achewood's wacky situations and generally great writing are an important part of it, but what really makes Achewood great is it's cast of characters.  There are few things I know of, whether books, movies, or other webcomics, where I find it as difficult to choose a favorite character as I do for Achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem is that all the recent stories is that there's been too many of them, and they all focus on Ray.  We'll get a few strips with Phillipe or Beef or whoever, and then several weeks of Ray strips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray's great, but so are Phillipe, Todd, Beef, Lyle, and everyone else.  When we're not getting story arcs, it works well because we can get a variety of characters in different strips, which lets us get all the fun of the full Achewood ensemble without having to come up with a single situation that incorporates all the characters, which can feel contrived. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When story arcs used to be less frequent, they were a nice change of pace to get the occasional bit of continuity.  Now that we're getting tons of them, it feels like we're just seeing Ray get into wacky situation after wacky situation and it's hard to remember the last time we saw some other characters for more than one strip in a row.

      The first sentence of that post was badly worded.  "Involve" should probably be replace with "revolve almost entirely around".  I love Ray, and have no objections to him being prominently features, I just think we haven't seen enough other characters features alongside him lately.

      The Story of Lyle didn't involve Ray at all and it was potentially the worst in recent memory. Likewise although Cornelius and Polly involved Ray eventually it was not his presence that seemed to invoke the most ire and rather the characterization of ConPol. <br/>

      That's true.  I think those two arcs has a different issue, though.  For Lyle's story, it was one of these "it's not funny, it's character development," sort of things.  We learned a lot about Lyle from it, and we saw a side of him that we haven't seen before, and it was fairly well written.  The problem is that character development isn't really what most people want from Lyle.  When we see Lyle, we want to see him throwing up on a football or or giving people the finger.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Polly arc was similar.  It helped developed Cornelius by showing us a negative side to a character that is generally well-liked who we almost never get mad at.  But while that was interesting, it's not something that we necessarily wanted.  When we see Cornelius, we like to see him giving sage advice or winning the badass games, because that's the side of him we like.  No one really wants to get mad at him because everyone likes it when he's being awesome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, from a literary standpoint, I think those arcs are fine, but the problem is that very few people read Achewood from a literary standpoint.  On the one hand, one of the best parts of Achewood is that fact that, despite being a ridiculous and humorous webcomic about cats getting into silly situations, it still sometimes manages to have some literary merit, enough to be name best graphic novel of the year by Time magazine.  At the same time, people still read it as a webcomic, not as a work of literature, and in the end, we come here because we want to laugh.  And strips that show us sides of characters that we never really wanted to see don't really make us laugh.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's also why the Beef wedding arcs were much more successful than the Lyle and Polly arcs.  They were about character development, but it was positive character development for Beef, and everyone loves seeing Beef get philosophical or happy.  On the other hand, most people don't really like seeing Lyle get sad and sentimental or Cornelius get obnoxious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The recent arcs, of course, have not been like this, as both this arc and Charley in Wales are more centered around putting Ray in ridiculous situations for humor than character development, but then they fall into the same pitfall I discussed in my other post of us just seeing too much Ray and not enough of anyone else.

      I disagree. I actually found the Story of Lyle to be dull and poorly written. It added very little that needed to be said and I don't think it helped characterize him better at all. My feeling that it was predictable and didn't advance his character are actually some of bigger points I have against it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cornelius though... I guess some people disliked him because of it, but I don't even remotely share that opinion and I don't think it was intended to be the impression given. Many people seemed to dislike him for picking apart Ray so astutely with his new girlfriend. I saw it as them getting along together wonderfully and Ray trying way too hard to have a legitimate interaction with someone else's stripper girlfriend and failing.

      My problem with the Cornelius/Polly arc was its abrupt ending. We see a brewing conflict rising from Ray's inability to get past Polly the stripper to see Polly the girlfriend of Cornelius, but this is never resolved in any respectable fashion.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now Cornelius appears back to his old ways. Even if we were to assume Ray went for a six hundo apology, there isn't sufficient closure on that arc.

      I think the Polly arc may have ended so abruptly because of the criticism.  It's possible that Onstad just read all the negative feedback and decided that he didn't have a good way of rescuing it, so he just dropped it instead.

      Well, with the Lyle arc, I think regardless of how it was written the problem was more the story than the writing.  The main thing that I found interesting about it was what it tried to do.  Lyle's a character who generally has had very little depth in the past, whose main purpose is just to be really crude in a hilarious and sometimes kind of likable (as long as we don't have to deal with him in real life) sort of way.  I mean, at one point before the arc, I remember someone commented about finding out about Darlene based on that old strip with the Darlene hat, and one person responded with something like "This is Lyle we're talking about.  Darlene could be a damned car."  So trying to add depth to the character and getting us to maybe take him kind of seriously for once and showing that Darlene was not just an actual woman, but that what happened to her was something actually tragic, was an interesting thing to attempt to do.  But as I said before, it wasn't really entertaining or funny, the main things we look for in Achewood, and it didn't manage to have a level of impact or character development or quality on the level of the Beef wedding arcs, which are what I think is necessary in order for arcs that heavily prioritize character development over humor to be accepted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also think your analysis of the Polly arc's intent may be accurate, but regardless of whether it was meant to show a negative side to Cornelius or not, a lot of people definitely saw it that way, and it was one of the things that people didn't like about the arc besides the relative lack of funniness.

      The problem, as I see it, is that the entire arc consisted of: Lyle meets trashy woman trying to flirt her way into some free food, they happily date briefly, they get into a terrible, screaming white-trash relationship, woman dies inexplicably in a bizarre accident. There's no development there. She's just a terrible ex who made his life hell and died in an unexpected way when he wanted her gone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe a bit of "I wanted to be rid of her, but not like that", but that's pretty damned subtle to be throwing in there. It also glosses over most anything else that could have happened to him by saying he came out West afterward. No further adventures implied. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've never known anyone who doesn't critique their friends and their foibles. Especially with the person they're dating. It felt far more like she was becoming part of his world than anything else.

 <br/> 
Publishers Weekly <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mushing is an odd sport for anybody. First you take a dozen-plus slightly tamed dogs ("damned wolves with collars," one rancher calls them), strap them to a sled that, with little enough provocation, will send you rocketing into the tundra and start out for the 1000-mile race accompanied by chunks of frozen liver and the occasional whole reporter-this after forking over $1249. O'Donoghue, who moved to Alaska from the lower 48 to work for the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, decided to start mushing after just two winters. He soon entered Iditarod XIX while writing a column for the paper titled "Off to the Races." Perhaps because his own mishaps (shredded doggie booties, sled falls, lack of sleep, poor visibility, missed shelters, tangled, bruised, grouchy and, as the title implies, polymorphously perverse, dogs) don't really change over the course of the race (they just accumulate), O'Donoghue introduces a large cast of other mushers. These do bring new misadventures, but the account can be a little confusing. O'Donoghue's style is amusing but rarely laugh-out-loud. Instead, what really keeps this book going is the same thing that keeps the racers going, a kind of bloody-minded doggedness that thinks, when faced with frostbitten fingers, not about the possibility of amputation but the possibility of scratching.

      The Scion... uh, the big, boxy one, is decidedly ugly, but also handles terribly. It is unreasonably awkward for a smaller car. Since promotions giving out $15 gift certificates to a local record shop for taking a test drive of one of their models are fairly common here (and take place across the street from said shop) I've had a chance to revel in the awfulness that is driving almost all of their various models and their terrible attempts at marketing their vehicles as hip and cool. Primarily by implying that playing awful hip-hop and electronic music very loudly is the primary intended end use for the vehicle. I would opine that although severely discouraged it is perhaps the only thing it actually does fairly well.

      Hip, young people often live in the city where trying to park something that large and unwieldy is an exercise in futility. <br/>

However, both of the major car sharing companies here have decided to make Scions of various types their most common vehicles. I find this incredibly distressing. I don't want a Mini because it's hip, I want one because I can park the damn thing a hell of a lot easier. There's a good reason why I own a car, but primarily only drive it to move it for street cleaning.

      Larger cars definitely exist, but it's still pretty big. Even more important is that when driving it they managed to make it feel larger and more unwieldy than it actually is.  <br/>

There's a reason why there are at least four or five Smart Cars in my neighborhood. Many of the spaces are barely even large enough for them.

      I liked a recent ad where they show happy, hip, young people driving it to a party. When they get to the party they parallel park the horrible thing by having a special effect shift the car horizontally into place perfectly. Not the 15 minutes of awkwardly trying to back it in, everyone trying to tell the person driving how to do it properly, at least one person getting out to direct, and eventually just giving up because it's either too small or too small for your terrible parallel parking skills and just driving around for another 15 or 20 minutes until you find a space you can actually fit in.

      I'm afraid the research both are conducting is seriously flawed. People don't like reading about "real" lesbians. They like reading about straight women who, after a few drinks and reminiscing about underwear tickle fights in the dorm in college, find themselves going down on their neighbor's wife. Who wants to read about flannel-clad women with bad haircuts and ugly cars? Dudes both lose this contest as far as I can tell.

      It is important to have unlimited means before you visit the Highlands. There is a great deal to spend your money on. Once a week a boat comes into Inverness loaded with sweets and gin from Newcastle. There are over ten pubs, and you may be invited to play low stakes bridge with a minor landowner (don't tell the minister!). In Thurso there is a dog who will bark for pennies. Also, you may need to ransom yourself from brigands.

      I was wondering the same thing. <br/>

I think at some point that we were not privy to - some sort of  <em>secret war</em>  if you will - continuity was re-written so that everybody on Achewood-Earth is a cat, and there are no more humans.

      There have been continued sightings of at least a few humans recently: the illustration of the Publican on the Strovis-Bishopthorpe, the inventor of comic sans, and of course Chris himself. I think it boils down to Chris just being more comfortable drawing cats whenever he can (or the occasional bear)

      I think you're missing the point.  The key here isn't whether the website is appropriate or not in general, it's whether it looks appropriate or not at a glance.  Sure, the sight features a lot of drugs and sex and occasionally cat dong, but if someone sees you looking at it it still just looks like you're reading a webcomic.  Someone see you looking at that picture on the other hand, and it looks like you're looking at porn. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The issue here isn't what's appropriate for whom.  We just don't want people who happen to glance at our screen while we're reading achewood to get the wrong impression.

      that's a pretty unappealing picture any which way you look at it.  I'm heterosexual, but damn, when people say they are attracted to the likes of Sarah Palin and/or her daughter, whatever her name is, it's like, wow, I'd just as soon have sex with Palin's husband.

      Jim Ladd - Now...  The last song on side one... the song about the  <br/> 
mother here... because mother always means, 'specially in this  <br/> 
country, I mean it's, is it mother God and apple pie, or what order  <br/> 
do we run that down? <br/> 
 <br/> 
crew- Chevrolets <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jim Ladd - Chevrolets, Mother, God, and apple pie.  But anyway, she's  <br/> 
up there somewhere in the top three, with a bullet, in American  <br/> 
culture, and always is the absolute vestige of purity and warmth and  <br/> 
security and all of that.  And here in this song, you approach mom  <br/> 
that way, but, the very fact that she does all of this stuff, is what  <br/> 
really is wrecking the child, correct? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roger Waters - Yeah, overprotection.  If mothers err, it's often...  <br/> 
ah I suppose some mothers neglect their children but I think an awful  <br/> 
lot more of them overprotect them and go on trying to mother you for  <br/> 
far too long.  Don't get me wrong, it's, that's not how I feel about  <br/> 
my mother.  I don't feel that that's exactly what she did, I think in  <br/> 
fact I think that she gave me, in lots of ways, a kind of, a  <br/> 
reasonable view of the world and what it was like, or as reasonable  <br/> 
as she could, nevertheless I think that ah parents tend to  <br/> 
indoctrinate their children with their own beliefs, far too strongly,  <br/> 
and my mother was extremely left wing, and I grew up really believing  <br/> 
that left wing politics were where it was at, and, but of course all  <br/> 
the, all the children of right-wing parents, all have held opposite  <br/> 
views, and it's very difficult for parents to say to their children  <br/> 
well now this is what I believe, but I might well be wrong, you know,  <br/> 
who knows, because they don't feel they're wrong, <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jim Ladd - no <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roger Waters - 'n they've sorted it out and they feel they're right,  <br/> 
but, I think you can waste an awful lot of your life  if you just  <br/> 
adopt ahh your parent's view of the world, or if you reject it  <br/> 
completely as well you know if you use if you use their view either  <br/> 
positively or negatively to the exclusion of thinking it out for  <br/> 
yourself, you can waste ten or fifteen years (snaps fingers) like  <br/> 
that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jim Ladd - this thing about won't let any dirty girls get through  <br/> 
(laughs) did your mom check out all your girlfriends for ya? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roger Waters - No she didn't actually, well ya, um, ya actually she  <br/> 
did, ya.  I think she was kind of old fashioned enough to think that  <br/> 
you know what would be really bad for me, would be, to find a nice  <br/> 
clean girl, and get married, you know, get hooked into some  <br/> 
relationship when I was too young, which in fact I did.  But that's  <br/> 
another story, so it shows  -- I can remember her specifically  <br/> 
actually encouraging me really to go out and look for dirty girls,  <br/> 
you know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jim Ladd - really!? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roger Waters - yea <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jim Ladd - oh how great! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roger Waters - well I'm not so sure I think that you know that was  <br/> 
another -- a bit more control  -- pushing you in either ah, you know,  <br/> 
it's up to you, who you, you know, what you wanna do with women is  <br/> 
your affair, really.  Unless you want ta seek somebody's advice, you  <br/> 
don't want somebody watchin' you, I didn't anyway <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jim Ladd - Especially not ah her <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roger Waters - Especially not your mother

    <span class="comment-text hideable">
      In this glowing item from Gladi8orrex, he prefaces with an admission of failure. In the first of two coherent sentences found therein, the author enlightens the reader with said failure and then invites his audience to guess from eights of ones of choices, ranging from illegal sexual conduct to, "nothin'". The large berth of his possible actions in the list essentially wills the reader down unsavory paths of thought, clearly depicted with item two; "kill sunbody who dint deserver" and number five, "shit ma pants li'l bit". These wishes though length and breadth of the writing infers foreshadowing as to a larger work, describing what actually happened to the author, justifying this work and the next. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To achieve proper understanding of this text, we must first understand the context in which it was written. What exactly was Gladi8orrex experiencing as he feebly scribbled the first draft onto what was surely a nap-kin using a fork tine dipped in ketchup? The first choice, "hab sex wit 15 y/o" is a bit tricky to decode, but in seconds it can be deciphered to mean that Glad used 15 yoghurt company owners for sexual gratification. (In Gladi8orrex's time, a slash stood for 'company') The second is reference to blatant, unnecessary violence, "kill sunbody who dint deserver". The third option is obviously the author relating to the reader that he broke his mother's glasses. Interesting to note is how his mother would have to imbibe liquids using 'cups' instead of glasses. Perhaps he became privy to illness-inducing substances in said glasses and acted to save his mother's life. That he would perform such a selfless action raises quesitons as to the exact nature of the author's relationship with his mother, but that is a whole 'nother play on a different day. Option number four, "lose a fight" is notable in that it is the only sentence in the entire work (save the first half of the introduction) that is still clearly understood by readers today. Illustrating his weakness and humanity, Gladi8orrex attempts to garner sympathy for him being defeated in some type of fight. In his day, many fights took place for many different reasons, so it is difficult to pin down exactly what sort of fight occurred. Some scholars raise a point that there is no description of the fight, so it may have well been a bodily one, while others defend that it was perhaps in his supposable humiliation and embarrassment that he did not share what sort of fight he was involved in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The next two choices are referential to each other, in that both contain the nounverb "shit". In the first, number five, Gladi8orrex writes that he "shit his pants a "little (sic)" bit." Etymologists have uncovered several meanings of this word. One of them refers to fecal matter, or if it were verbed, to expel fecal matter from one's self. Another refers to one's belongings. It is hotly contested which definition should be attached to choices five and six, due to possible disclusion of words in choice five, which the author had been known to do. It is up to the reader to decide which of these definitions fits best or if multiple definitions are necessary at all! The seventh option is ponderous for many in the literary world, as the precise definition of 'accident' has been lost. Does Gladi8orrex refer to a vehicular accident, such as one crashing into another or premature bowel or bladder evacuation? Again, the audience is left to suppose on their own, adding to Gladi8orrex's artistic use of language. The final choice, nothing, leaves little to imagine. Nothing is simply that, and that is all it is. Nothing of particular significance occurring to the author is possible. Boredom may have set in and Glad may indeed have used it as fuel to formulate the text. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Gladi8orrex's works are consistently being found in new places where there is no possibility of him being. It is clear that someone is disseminating his text periodically, and occasionally it is surprisingly topical. To imagine a world that dealt with the same issues and pressures ours does is purely amazing, not only proving that History repeats itself but that humanity does, too.

      Equating me to someone with the capacity to send the U.S. into war with Iraq and that long-winded attempt at erudite humor to an intelligence report is quite a stretch. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, it wasn't an attitude of tl;dr toward intelligence reports that got us into the war - it was the attitude that if the intelligence reports didn't say what we wanted them to, we could just rewrite them so that they did. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not saying that that treatise up there should be rewritten.  I'm just saying it wasn't funny, and that reading it was a waste of time.  In other words, that it was... lame?

the hell!  It was the tl;dr attitude towards intelligence in general that allowed reality to be manipulated and manipulated until everyone was living in a fucking rabbit hole full of KY! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I took your tl;dr as hostility towards erudidity and so I responded with hostile trolling.  I've certainly read funnier things, but it had a few good parts, and more importantly, it was, overall, clever, which is not the same as funny and is something that one must be, indeed, a tad bookish to appreciate.  If you don't appreciate it, that's fine, but maybe that means you're sub-human and you should go crawl into Sarah Palin's natch and scratch behind your ear until she squirts you out like so much floatsam blown airborne by a cetacean's blow.  That's all I'm saying.  Don't get so worked up about it dude.

      in case anyone has ever wondered why cats tip over glasses of water all the time, I may have a reason... <br/> 
 <br/> 
When looking down into the glass, the cat sees reflections and refractions making it look like there is something located next to the glass.  The cat attempts to paw at that something without success; it is a mirage.  The cat surmises that to get at that something it must reach through the mouth of the glass, then knocks over the glass in an attempt to get a better angle at the mirage via the mouth of the glass.

      Mr Williams is nearly one hundred and is unable or unwilling to use his arms to place the phone back on the receiver. I'm also assuming that Ronnie took the phone off the hook and dialed for him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Being almost one hundred breeds nothing but contempt for these telephonic devices (i.e. look at him just cold yelling at the limp and defenseless phone as it rests on the table). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Wait. How can he hear the person on the other end of the phone (the receiver has to be replaced for Speaker to work in all the phones I've ever used).
