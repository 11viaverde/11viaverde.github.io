      I never got the modern smoking ads. "They say it's cool to smoke." Who does? Aside from smoking fetishists, I haven't heard a single person say it was "cool" or anything as much as a MySpace friend of "cool."

      you know, as being of the "younger generation" and subjecting to all sorts of anti smoking advertisements i still picked up the habit. and now every time i see an anti smoking ad  <em>my cravings jump to the moon</em> . a cigarrette sounds so much more delicious after them telling me it will kill me in terrible ways.

      Same here. I came into school believing smoking to be a foolish thing, engaged in by people of low mind. This view was eroded by every anti-smoking assembly, video and lecture until, lung cancer or no lung cancer, I was damn sure going to do the opposite of whatever these fuckers told me.

      I'm going to respond to my own comment with this interesting factoid: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Smoking in airplanes actually made flights far less healthy. Back in the golden days of smoking flights, the air had to be cleaned and recirculated every three minutes. Now, however, the airlines realized that without any actual smoke in the air to be cleaned, they could do it far less - say, every ten minutes.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
This results in thinner air and more carbon dioxide, which gives people headaches and increases irritation. Viruses also thrive in this air, since it's not cleaned.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The first case of flight rage occurred just after the smoking ban due to this. The man was jonesing for a cigarette and trying to drown his sorrows in drink. When the stewardess denied him his last drink he stood up, crouched over the food trolley, and proceeded to take a shit on the top.

      Right. Let me tell you something. If I was on a plane where I had to be stuck next to the smoking section I would be all kinds of ready to shit on the food trolley. Your point is valid, but it does not argue for re-introducing smoking to enclosed spaces. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They've just banned smoking in Australia in pretty much any public enclosed space and quite frankly i'm fucking ecstactic about it.

      Neither. The decision whether or not to allow smoking in one's establishment should belong to the owner of the establishment. If it's my restaurant/bar/theater/whatever, I should be able to decide if you're allowed to smoke in here or not. Anyone who doesn't like my decision (one way or the other) is welcome to patronize a different establishment.

      That does bring up the unfortunate problem of equal opportunity hiring for said establishments. Their health rights need to be protected, as do the Entertainers working out of these places (DJs and Bands). I also think these owners have a duty of care to the public they serve, and as we all know, leaving these kind of decisions to private land-owners/entrepeneurs leads to their selective self-interests over that of the general public. To say that demand for this will drive the owners to take this into consideration is a very similar argument to saying that market forces will best serve the human population. I think the government has to becareful, and I totally get your problem with this, fortunately as far as this case goes, I think their intervention is welcome.

      ^^ I have not double-checked your comment for accuracy but it sounds totally believable. The air quality on planes is so dreadful that I cannot imagine a slight whiff of cigarette smoke making it any worse; and as a smoker who hates flying, sitting still in a cramped, uncomfortable, boring but high-stress environment for interminable hours on end without being able to even have a cigarette is torture and puts me in a half-dazed but extremely-pissed mood for hours afterwards. I would pay $$ extra to take a smoking flight and such things should totally be reintroduced.
