      correct.  that would be binary.  hrm... binary canary: either the canary is true, or the canary is false.  put it in a box, and it's Schr√∂dinger's canary.  would that be the explanation for when a woman is in the bathroom, and you don't know if she's deucin', and never will because she has mastered all of the other methods, and certainly wouldn't risk opening the door on her to find out?

      Certainly. But it's become a somewhat deprecated term these days. We are not living in the "Finger Age," nor has income inequality opened up a "Finger Divide" between the Western and Third Worlds. <br/>

Though both meanings are correct, Ray's usage here (and the fact that he is using "digital" to describe something more likely mimicked by a chip-based electronic device than a part of a hand) is just idiosyncratic enough to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144808/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=06232006"> Old School. </a>

      Once I was at a friend's house and did a sh!t SO huge it wedged itself in the bowl like a titanium thigh-bone in a Rancor's jaw.  I wasn't sure what to do about it... since it wouldn't flush... I was only a bit proud... so I went outside to get a stick to break it with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And when I came back... Matthew was all wondering what I was doing with the stick and I had to admit that I'd clogged the toilet. <br/> 
So he came to have a look... and admitted it was the biggest sh!t he had ever seen, and wondering how the hell I got that thing out of me (since I'm a skinny guy). <br/> 
 <br/> 
What it all basically comes down to is: I guess I know how a woman feels.

      once upon a time, one of my friends had a Worm in his intestine. he didn't know about it until, in the midst of a usage of the toilet during dinner at a house he was a guest at, he somehow crapped it out. just this huge worm now in the bowl of this toilet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i don't remember if he flushed it or not, but he was just all wide-eyed and freaked out when he came back to the dinner table and when his host family asked him what happened, he had to say it; <br/> 
 <br/> 
"i pooped out a worm!" <br/> 
the voice he says it in is pretty funny, and he swears it's how he first said it to his host family. <br/>

      "As your urine moves up the test into the testing area, you will see a control line which is always present and, if you are pregnant, another line. This line is caused when the HCG in your urine reacts with the monoclonal antibodies, creating a distinct color change. The color of this line will vary in intensity based on how much HCG is in your urine." <br/> 
(reference: https://www.babyhopes.com/articles/howpregnancytestswork.html) <br/>

I think the desensitized nostril is like the "control line" and, obviously, the other nostril is the one that tells you whether you're pregnant or not!

      I've always enjoyed them, as well, but I think Onstad picked a good time to end it.  I had recently started to think "I wonder how long these are going to go on?  Sooner or later it's going to be really odd for the kid, more as a reference point later in her life."  Think of how you would feel about your dad, as a teenager, if you found out he was giving thousands of people you don't know a weekly update on your early years?  He's stopping it right at about the time a kid starts to develop their own personality (and, I suppose, develop memories), so it's easy later in life to feel disassociated from those early years.

      Yeah, we all hope for the rosey-eyed view point; I'm not preaching against that.  As you said, "one day, when she's old enough"...there are often more turbulent years before that maturity hits, and a continued update project might cause some issues in those "delicate" times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was saying that I think Onstad chose a good time to stop the updates (before it possibly became something more embarrasing for his child in later years); I wasn't trying to make the updates as they are sound creepy or anything.

      It was once said (by Brodie Bruce in Mallrats) that Superman could "only bang regular chicks (without killing them due to, undoubtedly, "blowing a load like a shotgun straight through her back") is (with) a Kyptonite condom," which he then naturally points out, would kill him pretty damn effectively.  Via specific allergised radiation poisoning of the urethra. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I put forward, given that Lex Luthor (upon prolonged exposure to Kryptonite via a Kryptonite ring on his hand, so as to give Supes the old "fuck-off" any time he gets to close) lost a finger/whole hand because of the radiation, obviously a Kryptonite condom would also not be the best for the other chick.  This would not be a good glow for them to have. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know why he hasn't shacked up with Wonder Woman years ago.  Or Power Girl or Supergirl - I don't care if they're cousins, they're freaking aliens, who cares???  Or cross company universes and have a go with the (when not drawn as a body-builder) quite lovely She-Hulk.  The shagging that would ensue with any of these babes would  <em>shake the foundations of cities</em> .  Although Kal-El would be finished pretty early, I'm guessing, given his lack of...experience. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Which brings up another question - what about when he went through puberty?  There'd be holes all over the place in his corner of the Kent house!  Do Kryptonians  even go through puberty?  How would he get turned on, given that he's an alien?  Does he even have a dick? <br/> 
 <br/> 
All these, and more, are questions that have plagued the comics industry for aeons.

      There's an essay/lecture/thing by Larry Niven that discusses  <em>exactly</em>  what you're describing here.  Either you channeled him, or you're a hack.  The essay is called  <em>Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex,</em>  and can be found in his collection  <em>All the Myriad Ways.</em>

      I'm a bit of a hack, I guess, but forgot who it was.  Was it Larry Niven?  Yeah, some of that was from some old guy I read on the net, but I had no idea where.  I think we've all thought about that after watching  <em>Mallrats</em> , who it would seem copied him (if he came first. Heh, ironic choice of words.). <br/> 
 <br/> 
But it was all a lead-in to the question of the Kryptonite condom.  Would it be harmless to the woman?  I would propose that it would not.  And also, what  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144808/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptonite#Variations">TYPE of Kryptonite?</a>   Hot damn, the possibilites.  Also, just above it,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144808/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptonite#The_science_behind_kryptonite">it may affect humans.</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Pre-Crisis X-Kryptonite may be the best for contraceptive purposes, in my opinion.  How one would make any type of prophylactic, I'll be fucked if I know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Heh, also ironic.

      Seriously, Onstadt is a genius, but as a chick who farts (though discreetly) and shits (though courteously) without embarrassment, I find this strip to be more depressing than funny.  Because some women actually do things like this, like you'll always be able to tell when a woman is shitting in a public bathroom because she's there when you come in and still there when you leave but there is complete silence, because she cannot bring herself to pinch a loaf in the presence of another person.  That is the most depressing thing for a gender, when they cannot even do a #2 without feeling like they may be banished from society for it.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
All in all I'd say that this strip indicates more than any other the general intrinsic nerdliness of Achewood as a whole.

      I don't think the public bathroom anxiety is confined to you ladies.  My fear when I'm in a stall and someone walks in is not powerful enough to make me stop crapping, but I certainly try for a quiet and polite release.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other side of the bodily self-consciousness spectrum, my girlfriend makes :( in front of me, her friends, and her family all the time.  Hell, last night she ripped a  <strong>huge</strong>  one while we were spooning.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think, as has been stated earlier, that the effort one takes to conceal the sounds/smells/other ill effects of the bowels has little to do with gender.

      I'm not too sure about this assessment. I don't poo in public if there are other women in the bathroom, but it's not because I'm ashamed or embarrassed...if anything I'm way more comfortable with poo and farts than any lady should be. <br/> 
I just like pooing to be a private experience. <br/>

      Believe it or not, the answer is "no," because, I like to think, I have the sense to smell these type of bands from two towns over for what they are...but it's probably more because I'm a lazy "local music supporter."  I live in a town with a decent local music scene, in that there are a number of local bands with venues to play and local support; but that doesn't mean a lot of them aren't either too derivative or talentless for me to give a damn.  Plus I hate scenesters. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, after getting off my limp pony of a high horse, it also has to do with the fact that a friend of mine keeps trying to include me in on non-starter bands with names like "The Apes of Wrath" and "No, Baby, No."

      Am I the only person that worries more about not making enough noise in the bathroom? <br/> 
I mean like in public ones I guess I worry that other people might be thinking that I am just sitting in there not really doing anything I guess.  I mean what if someone was waiting to use the stall and couldn't hear anything cause you know sometimes it's hard to get those things out.  They would think you are some kind of jerk and holding them up when got to take a shit. <br/> 
I-I worry about this a lot when there are other people in public bathrooms with me and really just get so anxious :(
