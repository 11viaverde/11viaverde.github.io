      Alt text: you can always reboot unless it is a virus <br/>

Reminds me of what one of my CS professors said to my operating systems class in college. He was asking us about what one could do about a locked-up process (actually one with a single locked-up thread), and everyone was coming up with all kinds of elegant solutions like "restart the locked thread" and the like and the professor said he was thinking simpler: "reboot the machine." <br/>

      There are trucks, several stories tall. All around each are attached horizontally rotating wheels. Each wheel bears six L-shaped, crimson-stained blades. They spin slowly enough to follow with the naked eye, but quickly enough to instantly bisect anyone unfortunate enough to be nearby. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even if you run away far enough not to hear the screaming anymore, you can still look back and see the foul, red-tinted exhaust gas sitting on the scene like a shroud. And when you turn your back to the carnage, what's left of your hopes shatters as you see more machines coming from the other way.

      this is insane...this is exactly what i think of, and i really thought i was the only one...often if i'm very relaxed and sleepy, and like watching television or something, i will lightly grit my teeth (it's more like setting my teeth and flexing my jaw muscles) and sometimes that feeling will happen.  But yes, if i'm feverish or doped up on cold medicine, it happens more often too.  really, really weird that someone else thinks of this.

      Do you know anything about this phenomenon?  I've always been really curious where that comes from.  Additionally, often it seems like I'm  <em>just about</em>  to grasp what it means, or see some sort of visual image, but...I never do, it always remains just the hint of a scenario.  Inconceivable, faceless hugeness just destroying something tiny and delicate and innocent.  But the relationship between the two seems antagonistic, almost like they are somehow at war or something.  Man, this is hard to articulate, and I feel like I'm starting to sound nuts, so I better sign off...

      I didn't know it was a phenomenon. I've kept it to myself after too many frustrating attempts to explain it to people. Sometimes I get a visual accompaniment, though usually not something tangible.  <br/>

      That happens to me too. The most recent occurence, though, was three years ago. I was at an older relative's house, and I was allowed to sneak away to the computer, and I was playing a game on Neopets (parental block) where you are a tiny jelly dinasaur, and you can only eat smaller jellies, and for each jelly you eat, you grow. So anyway, this huge jelly came along and my dino-jelly was tiny, and all of a sudden I got that feeling, and at the time, when I felt that sensation, the first word to pop into my head to describe it was "chewiness". I don't know why, but it felt like a chewy feeling. I kept trying to describe it to myself, but the closest I could come was that feeling when a kid loses a tooth, then bites down on a straw, and it feels like the tooth is still there and biting through the straw. But that wasn't completely accurate, and I keep trying to recreate the feeling, but it won't come back, and when I have it, I try to hold on to it to describe it, but it goes away as quickly as it came. I'm glad to know I'm not alone.

      If you follow the theory of dreams that has them as a recapitulation of past memories that your brain isn't quite sure whether to keep in storage or turf out, it could be that the normal violence of human life subtly evokes a lifetime full of conditioning to see machines as horrifying, violent, and dangerous - and yourself and all people as helpless to stop them as beef jerky is to stop you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Long story short, your brain is trying to work out whether it has any use for a psychological coping mechanism for dealing with what happens when you run into an overtly predatory version of an SUV or combine. The reason you remember it is that your brain has elected to hang onto it, having been developed to solve the day-to-day problems of fragile, tree-dwelling simians on a landscape shared by lions and hippopotamoi. Watching over your shoulder for unstoppable killing machines just seems sensible to it.

      I know I'm two years late to the party but I'm assuming this is a dream you are talking about, it's pretty vague though. If it is, and I'm understanding correctly, many many people have similar dreams. Now the field of dreams is not widely understood (in fact many if not most scientists disagree about the theory that dreams are your brains attempt to 'digest' things that happened on that day, or the related theory that applies to past memories), but dreams of feeling tiny, or relating to tiny things, followed by their destruction or just generally being overpowered by a much larger thing, nearly infinite in size and matter, is fairly common, especially in people who have 'family issues'. I've never had the dream, and the first time someone told me about it I had no idea what they were talking about and couldn't understand at all, not helped much by the fact that people who have the dream don't understand what it is or what is happening themselves, and have trouble communicating it because it seems to be more of a feeling than an event. But a lot of people, including myself, believe that the dream has to do with your birth. The feeling of being tiny, innocent, and peaceful, then being overpowered by something enormous and incomprehensible is theorized to be similar to, if not the same, as the feeling you have as you are pushed out of your mothers womb, into the hands of a doctor, and into the big wide scary world. None of you mentioned this, but the dream is supposed to be absolutely terrifying. The scariest dream you ever have in your life. If one of you had I would be more confident that I am talking about the right thing. However, I've never heard anyone connect it with teeth or grinding, and that is probably an unrelated issue. Correlation does not imply causation after all.

      Use some kind of falsework to make a square elevator look round instead. It might not be quite the same, but you'll be kicking yourself for going for broke the fiftieth time you have to deal with elevator mechanics. <br/>

Elevator mechanics are basically like if what Pat thought about barbers were true - and he was being charitable. I cannot emphasize this enough: take whatever course your life requires to keep away from them.
