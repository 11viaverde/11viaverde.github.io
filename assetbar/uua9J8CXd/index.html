      It looks like they're in the fairway based on the background, so it's def. time for an iron shot. Though most par 4 holes that require a driver and an iron shot.. you'd probably be going with a 6-9 iron, or pitching or gap wedge. That's about a 250 yard drive, then 150 in, then two putting for par.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray plays like I play with my friends early in the season. We're all coming back to the sport from a 4-5 month hiatus and it's really not about hitting perfect shots, it's just about playing. If someone shanks a ball off the tee two fairways over, we just let him hit another. No big deal.  <br/>

      What I really love is how Teodor has to point out that Ray needs to carefully explain his actions to Pat. The idea of a man so extroverted that he cannot possibly keep track of his internal processes or realize that they operate in ways that impressively defy normal logic is just lovely, really it is.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I expect Ray would show up at Pat's house with the car, shout, "WHAT UP, doggie! I come totin' gifts! I bought you a god-damn car!" and then would immediately be distracted by something like a loud commercial or a slowly flashing light. Then Pat would startle him, he'd hand Pat twenty dollars (Ray would not know why), tell Pat to enjoy himself, and wander off while calling someone on his cell.
