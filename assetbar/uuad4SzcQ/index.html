      That was essentially what I was talking about. And what I think is important here is that his primary responsibility is to the people who pay for the subscription. Maybe that system sucks, maybe he ought to get adsense or some other ads and sell merchandise, but the way things are currently constituted, posting free content and neglecting subscribers wouldn't just be screwing people out of their money, it'd be stupid, too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't want to get into a shouting match here, and I'm sorry for being harsh before. Let's try and have some sympathy with the guy, though. He does this free of charge for all of us non-subscribers, which is pretty cool, from where I'm standing.

This is on par with that, and doubly ridiculous because you are someone who complains about every possible thing ever and get upset when people disagree with you. You basically have no right to disagree with anyone or be a douche.

      Maybe you did get upset.  I know you were upset that day, but I don't remember you being quite upset with auto as you are at me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had no intention of hurting you or making you sound stupid, or anything.  Teh check was for blastradius, who is being much too militant over this.  I can see why you guys are upset, but blastradius seems ready to kill Onstad.  I'm being douchey to him, not you.  I like you, tgh, you're not being douchey.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't complain about every possible thing.  For example, I never complained about his lateness or hiatus or the fact that he is giving more updates to the paid suscribers, even though I am irritated about it too.  I don't really get upset when someone disagrees with me; I get upset when I perceive that they aren't listening to what I'm saying.  I really don't get as upset over internet discussions as people think.  I get serious, and humorless but not upset.    <br/> 
 <br/> 
Bu I do have a right to disagree with people, even if I was being a hypocrite. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said, relax, dude.  I mean no harm :)

      Actually, the whole McG thing was a joke, because I usually snap in a very bad way, but I channeled it into a joke that, obviously, didn't come off as one. <br/>

      I'm not arguing that he should neglect the subscribers, because I understand that they are paying, but he has focused most of his attention on them while we were stuck with him not updating for those two weeks, and NOW they get more strips then we do? (since they get the strips posted here AND the strips posted on the subscriber side) THAT is insane and completely neglecting the base market.

      Also, for the record, I read a lot of other webcomics. I have nine webcomic RSS feeds going, not counting Blade Diary because it is not actually a webcomic and also not counting Achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Achewood isn't even my FAVORITE webcomic, but it is good and I would rather be able to read new strips on a frequent basis instead of being upset that because I don't feel the need to add another monthly payment to my growing list of them that I am a second class citizen.

      Yes, but the problem is that the subscription site was originally for extras. Strip previews, some blog entries, text messages. Y'know, extra stuff from the universe that is background information and making-of type of stuff. Now he's going to posting full subscriber-only strips. According to the post he'll be posting an equal number there as regular posts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He's already shown that he can't hold to his own deadlines the vast majority of the time, he's been putting out very little normal output as well and while it was annoying and we complained we largely understood. He was busy. He had a the tour and then the holidays and the rush of orders and then he moved unexpectedly. All of that makes sense and I can accept that there might be a bit of a lull. Now he's finally said "OK, I'm back to regular production" and one of the first things he does (aside from recycling a strip and missing his second deadline in the first week) is start producing as much pay content as regular content. That dog won't hunt monsignor! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Every other webcomic out there does free, regular content. It's not a case of Achewood being a subscription comic with a few bones being tossed to the rabble outside the gates every once in a while, but it's starting to feel like that's the case. Us sans thongs will be upset and we might start revolting if this keeps going in this way.

      Reasons belgand lamed lateadopter: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. That pseudo-rap shit has been done. <br/>

2. Name-dropping loneal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. Failure to name-drop belgand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
4. Blatant over-reaching with that "everyday-dius" line; any good rhymer would have said "everyday to us." <br/> 
 <br/> 
5. Seemed to be on same side as sje46. <br/> 
 <br/> 
6. Brought a vagina to a cockfight. <br/> 
 <br/> 
7. Pretentious use of Latin; don't care if there's some long-ass discussion of Jesus going apeshit lower down on the page.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
8. Obscure reference to The Onion; hates those fucking smug bastards, thought he wasn't good enough for their goddamned "ironic" newspaper. <br/> 
 <br/> 
9. Misappropriation of black culture drives him insane, as lateadopter is obviously white. <br/> 
 <br/> 
10. Meant to reply, clicked wrong link again, didn't want to admit it.

      If the creator wants to charge you, then yes you should pay for it. Plus, you are still getting it for free. <br/> 
 <br/> 
No, you don't have to pay for anything. Doing without or figuring out a way to steal it are also options. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In another message you called me a troll. That's not entirely true because I don't care if I illicit an emotional response. What I do care about is calling attention to the logical flaws in arguments like "Stuff should be free" and "If some stuff is free, extra stuff should be free" and "People who charge for their stuff are dicks".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I bought some things in the past so I deserve more free stuff now" seems pretty popular, but I have my doubts about all these people with all this Achewood merch, but then they won't pay $3 for a little more Achewood. That's like saying you'd rather have the souvenir tshirt than go on the trip.

      @ Tripperday: I'm starting to believe you don't understand that there are other methods of commerce apart from "I sell product, you pay me," and that it's not necessarily the best one. In fact, for a webcomic, it might be the worst one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sure, a creator has every right to charge whatever he wants for his product. No one's disputing that. But if that product has been accessible for free for the past eight years, and if that product is a  <em>webcomic</em>  (a medium that is traditionally free to all), then yes, it should be free. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And no, buying merch does not entitle one to free product, but that's not the point in the first place. One buys T-Shirts and book collections for two reasons: because one is happy to support the author; a "good on ya, mate!" for putting out entertaining content, and because the merch in itself enjoyable or cool to have. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And  <strong>yes,</strong>  "all the other webcomics are free, so this one should be too"  <strong>is</strong>  an acceptable argument for why Achewood should remain free. It's called business. Supply and demand. In other words, "Why the fuck should I pay to read your webcomic when there are literally thousands of other ones that would be glad to have me as a reader?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
As I've said, I've coughed up a good deal more change through the store than I would have had Onstad straight-up charged for his comic in the first place. I've done so knowing that while cool, the stuff I bought was in large part to say thanks to an author who's brought me a lot of enjoyment, asking nothing in return. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So why, you ask, won't I pay $3 a month for extra content? You're right, it's not too much; $3 is like, less than a cup at Starbucks. Well, I guess it's because it's rather conniving, it's a kick in the face of fans who have supported Achewood, and I won't support it. If it was a nickel a month, I wouldn't support it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean Achewood turns decent traffic. Most anybody aware of webcomics knows about Achewood, and probably likes it. Onstad was Time magazine's Mr. Graphic Novel of the Year, and has an enormous amount of goodwill going for him among comics people and pop culture devotees in general. The man just had a hardcover put out by a major comics publisher, with one more in the works, and animation on the table. And you're going to tell me that the only way he can turn a decent buck is to sell what he used to distribute for free? These are not exactly hard times for this comic in particular. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Again: If it's that hard to keep Achewood profitable, I think I could stand to see some Google ads, or buy a cool new T-Shirt. Especially since selling adspace, published material, and merchandise are the  <em>only</em>  proven ways to make money from a webcomic.

      Here's a problem I see emerging in this discussion. "Should" Onstad make Achewood a subscribers-only strip? Probably not, because it would drive away many of his readers who have come to expect free content. "Ought" he to? (ie does he have a moral obligation to provide it for free) Within the context of a capitalist system, he has every right to. The problem arises where people are expressing their frustration in moral terms. The (at least somewhat reasonable) expression of "Onstad, I feel like this is becoming a subscribers-only strip, which I will stop reading" is couched in the angry language of "fuck you, you don't have any right to do this to us" in some cases, which just confuses the entire thing. <br/> <br/> <br/> I'm going to go ahead and agree with the idea that a subscription-based business model is a bad idea, and I would probably (given my general poverty) stop reading the strip. That doesn't mean I have a right to force him to do one thing or another. However, I also disagree with the assertion that this transition IS occurring, and I feel like update irregularity and more updates for the subscription crowd is a combination of personal issues and a desire to give the people who are paying for the content their money's worth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You may not agree with my analysis, but if we tried to think about the arguments and sub-arguments in a more discrete form we can deal better with this "giant blob of hate" problem. Then, there's the additional problem that the forum structure doesn't make this easy, but, well, whatcha gonna do.

      Of course Onstad has every right to charge for his work, regardless of what other creators are doing. I'm merely suggesting that a move toward subscriber content might be bad for business. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only thing I disagree with you on here is that it's a problem for people to express frustration in moral terms. Again, Onstad has no obligation to his fans, he can do whatever the fuck he wants. However, when you begin to alienate your fanbase, you can expect backlash.

      I don't think that, right now, Onstad is playing on moving to a purely subscription based format. I  <strong>do</strong>  think, however, that creating two subscriber only strips after being on hiatus for a while and telling us that he will be releasing content "sporadically" because he wants to maintain quality is bad form. If you have the time to create four new strips, release them to the public so more people are willing to buy stuff from you!

      Also, when the subscription thing was purely for peripheral content I was fine with it, but releasing content (as in strips, quality or not) for subscribers after making non-paying customers suffer through a dearth of comics (because he didn't stop providing subscriber content during the break, which was the right move) is a horrible way to drum up business.

      I agree that it is highly unlikely that it's going to be premium content only.  I doubt that after this week he'll continue to post premium content the same as he did.  He just feels guilty about basically abandoning paying customers for like two months.  He feels bad about abandoning us too, probably, but we didn't pay money.

      firstly I feel bad for replying, twice. (double the guilt) <br/> 
 <br/> 
secondly I'd rather see two good strips a week than 5 meh strips a week. seriously go read his state of the achewood blog post. and try and not be 12. real life happens. and he admits to having a damn bakery of buns in the oven, achewood wise. so maybe ease up, and hope for some drinky crow show version of achewood some time in the next few years. cus that would fucking rock. with the amount of lames your not getting people see your point, and I'm not laming you or trying to flame you, ect, nice that asset bar isn't what it was when they launched it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
when you live an adult life and are working on other mediums and CARE about quality, your gonna have slow weeks, months and yeah. years.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
also your bitching a lot for a guy not paying for a newspaper to read a comic strip that is garfield or marmaduke. if he's been doing all he says in his last blog for most of the year, the guy should get a damn metal for how good and consistantly up to date he does give us free content.

      THAT WAS FROM LAST MONTH. We ALL know that information. <br/>

This is different from a slow month. or week, he is deliberately not posting material in the non-paying section SO WE CAN'T SEE IT. Are you saying that people are paying for below-quality material or he is trying to trick people out of money by giving them low quality material? I don't understand what you are talking about, honestly, and I don't think you do either.

this is the reason he gives for the strip being behind ALL YEAR, not just a month. read carefully and stop being a dumbass.  <br/>

as for pay content, it's not the strip. if you think it's the strip. you have never had a sub. drop 3$ on you mom's credit card and see for youself, it's just a way to pay the creator for a little extra content. not twice the strip.

      I stick by my guns - there is not really a significant difference in the treatment of non-subscribers than most other webcomic artists out there. Delays and hiatuses are a fact of life. If it pisses you off so badly, go do something else. It's not like he's earning ad money from free readers.

      three dollars a month, though, it really is a little over-the-top.  I mean, sure, I could afford it, but it just seems like an unnecessary annoyance.

      Whatever your feelings on this may be, let me assure you that the premium content never sucks. I'm not trying to sway you or anything. Just wanted to clear that up. My subscription lapsed and I'm not sure whether or not I'll renew it. But that has nothing but nothing to do with the quality of what he's posting over there.

      I'm mostly concerned by the fact that there is a noticeable shift towards pay content on the site, and the pay-for-content model only seems to work for porn and runescape, that Onstad is screwing himself out of the money that makes this very excellent strip possible.

      I've got the subscriber only strips.  They're not that fantastic, I'm pretty sure he puts them there because he doesn't want them in canon.  I still enjoy them, but it's apparent that the ones posted here are of a much higher caliber. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus, in the past subscriber only strips have turned out well enough to appear on the main page (that Roast Beef old-guy-name strip, for instance). <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, if you want to pay $3 you can get a little more Achewood, but if not, you're not missing anything essential to any storyline.  <br/>

      I don't think the issue is Onstad making money, I think it's simply that he's alienating his core audience by doing so. Webcomics are free and that's the standard everyone has come to expect; a reader doesn't owe the creator of a webcomic anything because it's a cutthroat field in which one is lucky to have any kind of readership at all. That said, I really, really like Achewood, and therefore try to support it however I can, which is why I've spent over $100 at the store. And this is a successful business model because Onstad has made more money from me strictly from merchandising than he ever would have had he been charging for content in the first place. If Onstad feels he's not making enough money with Achewood, I would be more than fine with him placing ads on the site or turning out more things to buy at the store (not that he needs or wants my approval), but making fans pay for content they should be getting for free is only bound to stir up resentment. Ideally I'd like to see Onstad ditch the subscription model, focus on turning out three or four solid strips a week without blowing deadline after deadline like the good old days, and put out some cool new merch. There's plenty of space on my wall for another poster, and I could always use another T-shirt, but the last year or so of strips have made me begin to believe Onstad might not be having the fun with this strip that he used to. Quantity seems to be taking precedence over quality, and we see one or two (or no) labourious, fifteen-panel strips a week, along with a slew of "meh" subscriber content. I don't necessarily think Onstad's said all he can say with these characters, since he's been taking them in totally new directions and trying for a real shake-up of the Achewood universe, but I think it's possible he's said all he WANTS to say with them. Think about it, when was the last time we had a story arc that had an actual ending, with closure and satisfying character change?

      So if all the other cartoonists jumped off a bridge... <br/>

Anyway, I don't agree with that. I will admit that because "every single webcomic, ever" works that way, it is understandable there could an  <em>expectation</em>  that all content is free. Disappointment that some content may have to be purchased is even excusable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, it is outrageous that people can't just be thankful that most content is free, but instead become angry that the creator of something decides to charge for access to it. <br/>

      I don't think that the issue here is that Onstad is complaining that his readers are moving away because of the introduction of premium content. The issue is that, to extend your analogy, the potato-hungry masses aren't going to the charitable potato-donaters. They're standing in front of Onstad's stall and complaining. While probably getting their wives to run over to the free stalls and grab some of their potatoes, as well.

      Yes, you can use analogies. However, I believe a closer analogy would be every other farmer is giving away potatoes for free, and some people decide that they REALLY like potatoes and decide to pay an extra dime per day for the best potatoes. Which, by the way, is exactly what happened. (Except not with potatoes.)

      First off, if you read my post carefully, you'll find that I didn't say that Chris should not charge, just that I would not read it if he did.  <br/> 
I don't pay for shit that I can't hold in my hands and will disappear after a month.  <br/> 
Sorry that I was raised in poverty and the idea of paying three bucks a month to read some blogs and other stuff I don't really care about/for sounds really stupid to me.  <br/> 
If you want to pay for it, fine. If Onstad wants to charge for it, that's okay too. I understand having to make money, which is why I support him by buying a lot of merch... when I can afford it. As an added bonus, the merch is stuff I can use. Clothing, glasses, a keychain, and so on.  <br/> 
But if you want to charge me to read your comic, then I just won't read it. Sorry. I don't pay to read comics in newspapers either, mostly because I don't pay for newspapers.  <br/> 
I don't feel that I deserve anything for free, and I buy merch and just plain old donate to plenty of comics without expecting anything back. <br/> 
I'm mostly angry that a little pissant would tell me that I'm some sort of self entitled bitch because I'm a self sufficient adult and I have to make decisions about how I spend my own money.

      Don't try to back down and act like you didn't say paying for Achewood was bullshit, because that's exactly what you said. This is also not about your thriftiness or that you buy merch. This is about you taking offense at my suggestion you should actually support the comic itself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Why the fuck should I pay to enjoy something on the internet? The day I'm asked to pay to see Achewood is the day I stop reading it, cuz that's bullshit. " <br/>

      I stand by my statements.  <br/> 
Why are you jumping down my throat here? I'm pretty sure Onstad can market his subscriber only content by himself, and doesn't need someone to go around posting stuff like "It's 3$, cock."  <br/> 
If it makes you happy, I won't be reading Achewood anymore, and I won't be buying from their store, which according to your  statements is the proper course of action since I don't feel like paying money to read the strip, and would rather read the strip and then donate/buy merch as a sign of my appreciation.  <br/>

      Look, guy, nobody is saying the guy has no right to ask for money. No one says to send Onstad to some sort of webcomic re-education camp.  He has every right to ask; but that isn't to say we're all awful for complaining about it when he makes the decision to do so.   Doesn't it stand to reason we have the 'right' to complain--whether you think it is justified or not.

      the site is free, he just moved, (I just moved and I DON'T have a wife and kid and I'm still a month behind on every aspect of my life) he has been updating tues-thurs for some time now before the hiatus, and besides the hiatus isn't really over for anyone that understands whats going on here, and GOOGLE ADS SUCK, you have no idea how the ppl would bitch. now, I used to pay for the extra content, no it's not wonderful. but it was nice to give the guy some money for A SERVICE that I did find acceptable for the price.

      Now, you may know I'm usually the first to bitch about subscriber-only content or late strips, but I have the impression (and if anyone who IS paying can confirm/deny, please do) that the stuff in the pay area is quantity over quality - the stuff that doesn't make it into the main comic, but is still relevant - as well as the former blogs, and the twitter crap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, if those two subscriber strips are on par with the main strips that are constantly late, now we have grounds for a coup.

      They don't necessarily look like full-on decent strips, though. And seeing as we now have precedent for good strips from the pay-only area coming to the free section, I wouldn't at all be concerned by my lack of subscription. If I really wanted to see the strips when they were fresh and blinking in the sunlight, I'd probably cough up the $3.

      Sadly that film was not hilarious enough. A weak and flaccid entry. I suspect that No Country cleaned them out so when they tried to go again so soon they just didn't have it in them and had to limply eke that out onto our collective thighs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A shame too, it had plenty of promise and a great cast.

      Not hilarious enough? Is there a minimum hilarity level for a movie before posting stills of it on achewood is appropriate? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Please explain your hilarity metric so I can avoid this mistake in the future.

      Perhaps he means using swears in new and exciting combinations. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I was a lad, I went to Six Flags on a school field trip. My friend and I rode on one of the roller coasters, and behind us was a rather rotund man taking up two seats to himself. As we reached the apex of the first curve, he began to volunteer the cuss concoction he had devised, shouting <br/> 
 <br/> 
"OH FUCK IT WITH SHIT! FUCK IT! FUCK IT WITH SHIT! OH SHIT! FUCK IT WITH SHIT OH SHIT OH SHIT OH  <em>SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!</em> " <br/> 
 <br/> 
I believe the emotion he was trying to convey was a unique mixture of excitement and fear, almost like a combination of sexual arousal ("FUCK IT") with fear that would make a reasonable man crap his pants ("WITH SHIT"). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I give it four stars.

      "Copralalia" <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I don't know, never met one (it's a surprisingly rare variation).  The people I've known with Tourrettes had the common type that isn't really funny or entertaining, just sad.  Constantly coughing really loud at the most awkward of times, having to repeat certain phrases over and over again at times of stress and when they know it'd make the situation worse (like a job interview). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorta like narcolepsy: funny in movies, really sad and awkward in real life. <br/>

      Oh, I totally agree.  I know it's really uncommon, and I wouldn't laugh at someone with it.  But am I right?  Don't people with copralalia use unusual constructions like that?  Things that don't make a lot of sense like that.

      Although I have to admit, it's a bit paradoxical in that it espouses the existence of a God who creates things for pleasure while lacking the counterpoint of a Devil who lays those pleasures out for us to tempt us down to Hell.

      See Jesus wasn't a dick, but he was more like a regular person than the Bible lets on. All the times we think "God Dammit!" every day, Jesus would accidentally kill shit. <br/>

Fig Tree doesn't have fruit? Fuckin toast. <br/>

      Dude, Jesus going apeshit in the temple is probably one of my favorite passages in the Bible.  <br/>

It's almost like Jesus is saying "Loving God  <em>my ass</em> . You guys fucked around FOR TOO LONG."

When was the point where we, as a nation, grew up and realized that we couldn't explain why we used to think that Robin Williams was funny? I mean, I know I thought he was funny as a kid and it seems like most others agreed with me, but now -- and I don't think it's just his string of terrible movies -- that seems to be past. We look at him and see a sad man trying far too hard to get our attention with his cheap antics.

      In Morrissey's world, celibate is just a word that means "attempting to maintain an aura of sexual mystery despite the fact that everybody knows you're gay and has known since The Queen is Dead and you totally slept with that one boxer flatmate you had back in the day and jesus god Stephen Patrick, just admit it already, WE ALL KNOW."

      Is there something necessarily wrong with someone if they don't want to fuck anyone? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Asexuality is truly something people don't talk about much, but surely the man might be genuine about that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not saying he's not a tool, just that he can do or not do whatever he wants to with his junk.

      He's certainly free to do whatever he likes with his junk, but the fact remains that Morrissey's junk certainly isn't action-free. <br/>

It's the moon-calving hypocrisy that bothers me. Morrissey can fuck whoever Morrissey wants to fuck. He just shouldn't claim to be fucking nobody.

      Is there any question as to whether Morrissey is gay or not?  I mean, every song that involves romance, consideration, or sexuality is more or less directed quite pointedly towards a male.  Or, a woman in a coma that he can cheat on with a dude. <br/>

I can believe that he doesn't have a lot of sex, but I mean...if he did, it would be with men.  No questions.

      I swear to god, every time I read one of these, I feel like I'm in ninth grade reading Flowers for Algernon.  <br/>

Also, if I could improve one thing about myself, it would be my ability to not think of Flowers for Algernon every time I read one of these, as that ability is not currently at its best.

      If you don't realize how it's going to end from early on then... well, I don't know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Most twist endings are far too obvious to spot because they generally rely too much on basic formulas. If you're being misdirected it's probably the thing that's really obvious. Or the thing that you're supposed to never suspect. Or it's the guy doing it to himself (especially if time machines are involved). Or he's dead already and doesn't know it (not a spoiler, this applies to at least two films I can think of right now). <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're falling for these things you need to stop being so gullible.

      I didn't say it was a particularly shocking twist, but most "twist ending" movies don't hold up to repeated views, and same goes for books.

      I didn't say "repeated views" I said "initial viewings". <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is why "The Sixth Sense" is a terrible movie because the twist was obvious to anyone with a functional spine in the first few minutes and why "Fight Club" was both an excellent book and film because it holds up very well regardless of the twist. The twist enhances it, it's not a cheap attempt to draw meaning into a dull plot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd say that 95% of twists are obvious from very early on. Most writers don't know how to insert non-essential details which makes discerning how a plot is going to work out fairly easy. It's like how when you're watching He-Man you can tell which rock is going to give away because the animation is cheap and the color doesn't match correctly with the background. Or, as they say in many Simpsons commentaries, when people are wearing non-standard clothes or Grandpa is present they're going to be relevant. This is just a matter of being observant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I basically figured out "Jacob's Ladder" by reading the title and a bit on the back of the video box. If you didn't get it from the very opening then you obviously do not understand common plot devices or biblical references.

      It doesn't work for a number of reasons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
First off, the entire story hinges on one single event: Some dudes walk outside a club and see a guy  <em>beating the shit out of <strong>himself.</strong></em>  They eventually decide this would be a swell fellow to follow unquestioningly and plan events of mass destruction with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
BULLSHIT. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's a number of other little things like that throughout the movie that make it not work (the car scene, for instance.  <em>No one</em>  thinks, "hey, this guy's yelling at himself and he pretty much just tried to kill us by not driving the car properly on purpose, maybe we shouldn't be doing everything he says, especially since a lot of what he says is crazy"?). <br/> 
 <br/> 
My objections have nothing to do with MPD; I can accept it as a plot device. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Fight Club</em>  is a movie that has a lot of really cool scenes and actors, but if you think even medium-hard about it, the whole thing falls apart. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have not read the book, and do not plan on doing so.

      Would a bunch of dudes unquestioningly follow the orders fo a guy beating the shit out of himself and crashing a car while talking to himself?  Ask the question the other way round:  <em>Would a bunch of dudes who would unquestioningly (and eagerly) commit events of mass destruction follow a dude who beats the shit out of himself?</em>   Sure, it's not crazier than anything else they have been doing. <br/>

      Every single one of those dudes? They all just happen to find this guy and get together? And not one sane person who might, I don't know, tell the authorities, finds out about it? Nope. Not buying it. <br/>

It's not a fucking tour de force. It's not a groundbreaking piece of brilliant filmmaking.

      It's not "a really stupid movie".  Star Wars is considered one of the greatest films ever--by critics at least--and it doesn't make sense all of the time.  Why would the empire leave a vulnerable hole like that?  Why would the rebels destroy a construction site killing thousands of innocent people (Return of the Jedi, actually--still considered a good movie)?  And songs don't always make sense, either.  Look at Rolling stone's list of the greatest songs.  Smells like Teen Spirit: means nothing.  Hey Jude "The movement you need is on your shoulder."  What?  Right, these are songs.  But I noticed that a song doesn't need to make internal sense in order for it to be good.  There is atmosphere, there is aethestics.  The plot only affects the quality of the movie if it seriously takes away from the enjoyment; for you this is the case.  Not for everybody else.  For them, their are more important things, such as the heavy sense of atmosphere and dialogue and violence and nihilism.  All this is what makes it groundbreaking, how it just enrapts you.  It doesn't enrapt a few people who value coherent plot over everything else.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I admit that the scene where the men decide to join the club after they see Jack beating himself up bothers me, also, you can't kill another personality just by shooting your brain. But I just take those leaps of faith, and once you do that, the movie becomes very enjoyable.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, what paperboy said.  The guys in the car are already crazy.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
So overall, I think Fight Club deserves at least an A-.  If they fix the plot problems, it gets an A .  But in no way is it a stupid movie.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's a bold claim about DID.  They have found physiological evidence to support it, however.  I'm not a psychologist or neurologist (yet), so I won't go into that.  Jack, however, did not have DID (which is what MPD is called now), because he also hallucinated.  I think he has a made-up disorder.

      As far as the movie sticking together; anything this conceptual is probably operating a lot more on analogy than plausible adherance to a Psychological Disorder or the strange group delusion that Durden's mass cronies operate under (you only need one other person to believe the hype and spread it more eloquently in order to evoke mass loyalty). Durden and the whole farce of fight club is a summary of discontent, but far more about the fact that men have come to a point where they have trouble feeling anything without smacking the shit out of themselves. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wouldn't call it a "brilliant piece of filmmaking" either, but it certainly works as a kind of pulp-fictionesque analogy of the scattered state of many people's mental health, the poor state of emotional connection of men in general and the soulessness of a material driven lifestyle. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Worrying about Fight Club's poor grasp of reality is like worrying about Tyler Durden's grasp of reality... or basically the reality adherence of any Film Adaptation of a Comic book in the last 10 years.

      I always took the shooting to be metaphorically significant. I mean, he totally does shoot himself, but it is symbolic of him killing Tyler and taking control. He rejects him and is free. <br/>

      Some of that has bothered me, but for the car scene, at least, there is another character in the book that is the one driving. I believe they felt they could streamline the cast by just folding him into Tyler. He does a few other things, but is never really a major character. <br/>

      Well, not to be the biggest dick of recent times, but it totally worked for Obama. You make some nice speeches, you promise the vague concepts of "change" and "hope" and you're seen as not being like the guy that everyone hates (plus minority being the first to do something) and yeah, you'll get tons of support. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I voted for the guy, but there's definitely a crazy little cult built up around him that has largely caused people to ignore his actual voting record and real plans. I think some people are starting to wise up to that now.

The only way  <em>Fight Club</em>  would have worked is if they were all incredibly good at assassinating people who were not sympathetic to their cause.

      I think the point is that pretty much everybody working in service (security guards, maids, bellhops etc.) are sympathetic to them - they all think the system is unfair and since essentially they are the ones keeping it up, they are also able to take it down. <br/>

      Exactly. It's about how we are increasingly becoming a service-oriented economy. Everyone who felt disaffected and joined them was either from the service industry or low-level white collar wage slavery. <br/>

      The book also transitioned from "it is two people" to "it is just 1".   <br/>

And it had an awesome scene where his cronies tried to cut off his balls cause he was wandering around screwing up the plan.  Emasculation is pretty much an automatic 10 in my book rating system.

      I'm not certain because I never read that abomination of a book, but it's based on some real and totally crazy conjecture. I don't think you can fault someone for using something that's too easy if it's part of their source material. <br/>

Then again given his intended audience I think you could claim he only put as much effort into it as he thought he would need to fool them. <br/>

If you like the basic concept and the whole "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" ripped-off idea seriously consider reading the excellent comic "Rex Mundi". It's better, but deals with the same sorts of things. That and magic, alternate history, WWII as initiated by an alternate reality France that still operates as a constitutional monarchy with significant royal power, and a dominant and inquisition-happy Catholic church. <br/>

      I wholeheartedly laughed, because the fellow on the radio does not partake of liquor or cigarettes; this reminds me of myself, to some extent. <br/>

I believe I am in need of a tutor to educate me in the fine art of spelling, for my career is going nowhere and this has a terrible effect on note-taking and my resume (???). <br/>

Commentary: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Here Glad turns his attention to the plight of others.  He observes that his one-year-old cousin has succumbed to the temptations of alcohol and drugs.  With the resourcefulness that has become his trademark, Glad soon thinks up a plan: he will buy a fancy car, thus earning the admiration of his young cousin and affording an opportunity to turn the lad's life around.  Better still, he reasons, he will allow his cousin to work on the vehicle.  A diversion from the evils of the streets and a chance to learn a trade--what a difference Glad's car will make in his cousin's life! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glad has found the perfect vehicle, a vintage Jaguar coupe with the 4.2-liter engine.  But one small obstacle stands in the way: money.  Glad has begun working a second shift at the taco stand and is saving every penny toward that car, but his paycheck is meager and his cousin is falling ever faster into oblivion.  Finally, he reaches out to you, dear reader.  Won't you help him buy a vintage Jaguar coupe? <br/>

      Sir, your profound translation elevated my awareness of the misunderstanding of those visionaries who have transcended the discourse of "the streets" in favor of "the tubes" (as I am assured the World Wide Network is called by the youth of today). These poor souls are simply trying to communicate in a manner that is expressive and meaningful to them, and are unflinchingly called "uneducated," "ungrammatical," or "stupid fucking kids who can't spell" by the assorted nabobs and geezers of my generation (which oh-so-humbly names itself "the greatest").  <br/> 
Thank you, sir, for providing insight into the profound mind of these modern-day Chaucers, Frosts, and Joyces.

      It's not just the disgusting nature of putting butter on their crappy steaks, but also their nature as an mediocre chain, their system of scamming you by only selling overpriced "family style" sides, and a wealth of other problems. <br/>

Oh and I'm told that Peter Luger's does the thing with butter too and has likely been doing it a lot longer than that bullshit place. I can fucking respect Peter Luger's even if I despise that practice. <br/>

      Now are you referring to Outback and Longhorns and shit when you say cheap steak? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Because I should certainly fucking hope this "Cheddars" is better than those places. <br/> <br/> <br/> Still, differences in quality of steak, while important, are nowhere near the importance of quality in seafood.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The difference between cheap->moderate->expensive->Le Bernardin for seafood is an enormous leap between each level. Le Bernardin is so good it makes you want to throw out the whole idea of molecular gastronomy and rethink food entirely. No steak place makes you want to do that -- or at least no place I've been to. I don't care if it is Kobe beef served in the blood of 100 virgins, it won't top brilliant seafood.

      I used to throw 'em in here and there. Still do on occasion. But for the most part I have switched to the dash in place of it. It can legitimately be used in the same way and beyond as it is free from many of the grammatical constraints placed on the semicolon. It's kind of a wild card. Even that bitch Lynne Truss would back me up on that.

      Dashes and semi-colons have their own character to me and are used depending on the very specific nature of the sentence.  Also you can use dashes --like this in the middle of a sentence-- but you can't do that with a semi-colon; at least I don't think you can. <br/>

      Dashes are like the almost-parentheticals of the punctuation world. They signify a new idea, albeit one not entirely disconnected from the previous one. The semicolon is for those phrases more closely linked, but still distinct ENOUGH. The comma is for very closely linked ideas. I love Vonnegut to death, I really do (and I hope it was not my love that killed him) but he's wrong about the semicolon. It has its place, though dashes are better in 99% of all situations. It's all degrees of connected ideas, man, it's all degrees.

I don't see how he is a sell-out.  A sell-out to me is someone who forgoes artistic integrity in order to make money,  <em>and said before that he wouldn't do that</em> .  As far as I'm aware, Groening has not done that.

      Well, this argument is silly for many reasons, but mostly because you're making it sound like Matt Groening is as directly important to the "funniness" (subjective term) of the Simpsons as Seth MacFarlane is to Family Guy.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
My intuition is anything but scientific, but as someone who has watched all of the commentaries on the Simpsons DVDs (seas 1-8), it's always seemed pretty clear that Groening adds very little to the writing, vocals or even animation aspects of the show on a regular basis (he often seems to complain about the artists not listening to his suggestions, and his talk about writing sessions mainly just seem to involve him corroborating a story about some one else coming up with a funny line).  I've long seen Groening as the guy who created a great show, and has been a decent guiding force, but really he's more just a guy who amassed around a lot of great talent around this show.  That deserves merit, of course, but I don't consider the Simpsons to be great because Matt Groening is some kind of comic genius. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, I'm not Family Guy expert or anything (I was the kind of jack ass who was considered himself a Family Guy detractor shortly after the first episode aired, but I've actually grown to like the show alright; fully aware of all its flaws, I can appreciate the funny parts when they arrive), but I think it's pretty obvious that MacFarlane is much more involved in the day-to-day creative process of his show, and the show continues to be heavily influenced, for good or bad, by his sense of humor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh god how did I turn this shit into such a long post  <br/>

sorry everybody

      Very true. Groening I think only wrote a few episodes. Season 1, where he had the most control, is basically unwatchable shit (and I'm a huge, huge ludicrously huge super-fan). The person who exerts the most control is the show-runner for the season and this clearly shows in the quality of the golden ages. Generally David Mirkin did the best job followed closely by Messrs. Oakley and Weinstein. When a show-runner switches the change in the show tends to be rather obvious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's the writers who make the Simpsons good by and large. <br/> 
 <br/> 
MccFarlane though, yeah, he does a large number of the voices and it really always feels like his project. It doesn't really waver and continues to feel largely the same and I suspect it is because he is the one in charge and he decides what everybody sees.

      Okay, my outburst was ill-phrased. I know literally nothing of the creative process that goes into either show. Basically all that I know is that Futurama is clever and funny, and Family Guy is occasionally funny and occasionally unwatchable.

      Ray just gave Bill Cosby Teodor's phone number because he thought the old guy was kind of crazy and was too eager to be down with him. You want to hang with Ray you got to make it seem like you could have fun all on your own to earn his respect. But Ray has heard too many interviews on public radio where Bill Cosby appeared with psychologist Dr. Alvin Poussaint and he could tell that he was clearly there to explain away Cosby's archaic anachronisms and translate his scatting.

      She was not as far as we know. Further she was most certainly not wealthy enough to be considered old money. <br/>

If Ray was old money he would not have played tee ball or ever met Beef. <br/>

He was firmly upper-middle class. I grew up upper-middle myself and I can certainly see plenty of kids like Ray in my own past.

      No, just a nice assortment of sodas and a dish of Godiva. I spent a summer working at Godiva. Upper-middle class parents would bring their damn kids straight from Rainforest Cafe and the filthy urchins would cram their noses and slobber on the display case because they wanted candy and their mothers would shell out for kids who couldn't even appreciate the low quality that Godiva really is. They make it in Pennsylvania. They're owned by Campbell's in the US. <br/>

      Old money does that sort of thing all the damn time. They always have really. Obviously you need to become more familiar with various scandals affecting royal families around the world throughout history. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Going back to the first century Roman Empress Messalina was reputed to be a massive whore (literally and figuratively) and most famously was said to have engineered a competition with a notable prostitute as to who could satisfy more men in a night. Even ignoring much as this as conjecture and rumor it was still actual rumor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't nobody say nothing about you not being a total skank. If anything Paris' behavior is exactly what is often expected of the true upper class. Her money and influence insulates her to such a degree that she is able to pull that sort of thing off. She started a clothing line for dogs because she thinks it's fun to dress up ugly little dogs in terrible clothing. That's rich. Buying lots of snacks doesn't even come close.

      The town I grew up poor middle-class, was the richest town in the world for a while. Also very violent with gunbattles on Main Street around the same time-period. <br/>

 But I knew the kids mostly, not the parents or grandparents- the original wealth-generators. <br/>

 So yeah, they're either tight conservative or downright skinflints, which is why they're rich. <br/>

      It really does depend on the source material. Hence why there's the great line in "Return of the Living Dead" (written/directed by Dan O'Bannon; also known as the first movie where zombies spoke and moaned "BRRRRAAAIINNSSS!!!") where the main character upon trying to smash a zombie in the head and thus kill it says "The movie lied!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
In that you need to completely disintegrate them and even that does work. When a zombie is cremated the smoke just turns more corpses into zombies.

      I definitely prefer slow, Romero-style zombies. At the same time if we want to deal with  <em>zombies</em>  we can't ignore the real style that populates  <em>White Zombie</em>  where they're just Haitians that are drugged (in reality, where they were convinced that they were dead and reanimated) and forced to work on a dude's sugar plantation.

      Does anyone else feel like what Ray meant to say in panel three is "You ain't rad for bein', you lame for suckin'?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I feel like the way it is now it means "You aren't rad for living such an uninteresting life, you are lame for still being alive." Which just makes Ray sound very cross and mean. Whereas the alternate version, "You aren't rad for still being alive, you are lame for living such an uninteresting life" makes more sense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But then, this is Ray Dialogue we are dealing with. There are codes and methods and Subtleties not understood by unpublished writers such as myself.

      No. You're reading it wrong. It is midnight Tuesday. As in the midnight that occurs after Tuesday. You're being overly-specific and thinking that midnight defines a new day which may be technically true, but only for people who are crazy. New days start at dawn. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I sincerely think we need to change our system of time in a few basic ways to solve these problems. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The clock will start at 1:00 AM which will be at the current 6 AM. It will continue through 12:59 AM until we reach 1 PM at the current 6 PM thus neatly defining AM as "daytime" and PM as "nighttime". 12 will no longer be the beginning of the new period with a confusing PM at noon, but will come at the end as it makes more sense. Midnight will be the middle of the actual night and not some crazy new day nonsense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This system makes so much sense we can't not have it!

It's only ironic if he doesn't come. <br/>

      Well, I was originally just going to use the term "yellow fever" which, while clearly racist, is also the standard term to be used in this context and with the racist barbs directed slightly outward at the recipient. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I then tossed a bit of geek in there because it's certainly a driving factor as well. Perhaps this was a poor choice of placement. It probably would have worked better spoken where I could have more clearly delineated the mid-phrase addition of "geek".

      putting my two cents in... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I fuckin' love achewood and put a lot of stock in its artistic and social genius, but really, honestly, there has been a lot of shit lately. The strip is rarely as funny as it once was, and the premium strip service? Only hurting. I really don't WANT to be a dick, but I have to point out that Achewood is failing. I find that I do better work when I am, in fact, busy with other things, such as community college courses (!). Maybe Chris needs to reevaluate things. <br/>

Of course, I am not the artist here. Chris is. I just need to say how I feel.

      I can feel the power of being in the Pacific time zone myself. For me it is the same time as Onstad. I can feel his tardiness that much more strongly. True, you might have it worse, but I am on the same wavelength.

      Its the artist's prerogative to not release a work until he is satisfied with it (in fact, it is the artist's  <em>duty</em>  to reveal only what is fully realized). <br/>

Building a canon one can be proud of transcends deadlines (whether self-imposed or other). <br/>

One possible reason for the delay is that the next strip will summarize all negative posts.  Thus, by complaining about the delay, we - in fact - extend it (talk about being hoist with one's own petard).
