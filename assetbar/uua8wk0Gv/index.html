      I merely assume it is Onstad. It may be Lonis Edison's Patented Media Proxy, which would also not be out of the question. <br/>

The real Onstad all sitting on a park bench not far away, watching over the top of the newspaper. Gene Hackman in a van one block away, listening to signal triangulated from three different parabolic mics.

      The interview also refers to the fact that it's the first photo of himself he's published in connection with achewood. So yes, it's him. He looks pretty regular, actually. Not much of a thrill.

      I think it's a bit much to call the guy "fat". He certainly has a very round face, and it is a bit suspicious that he chose such a gut-concealing pose, but I think he looks pretty good for a middle-aged guy with a toddler who considers golf to be excercise. Plus, that's a nice sporty outfit; seems very "rich guy casual". My man-crush remains untarnished.

      It seems like a stretch that what is heard is self-evidently not  "...THE SMIIITHS...".   It seems reasonable to question whether he's singing a song about The Smiths as opposed to a Smiths song.  Moreover, it seems equally weird and pathetic of Theodor to sing an original song dedicated to the Smiths as opposed to merely singing a Smiths song, so it's unclear what wouldn't be funny even if he was singing a song that is a tribute to the Smiths.   <br/>

Your interepretation seems clear enough, and probably the right one to have, I just dont' think it is self-evident.

      yeah, that's the joke's effect, but i figured-- it's philippe's paper, if he heard the other guys talking about how sad it was, somebody [my vote lyle] probably pointed out the patheticism in that he was playing the smiths.

      Call it blasphemy if you want, but they're closer than Achewood is in relation to most other comics. Same willingness to approach the English language at kind of a sideways angle, same "after the moment" style of punchline. I have no Beef with Penny-Arcade.

      Family Circus sucks because it's willfully naive and saccharine to the point of inducing stomachaches, and would probably suck no matter what its subject matter is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think that's the best example anyway, since it's practically impossible to NOT get what Family Circus is talking about. It's rose-tinted 50s American nuclear family sugary garbage, and the misunderstandings of children without any wit or irony. Cathy or even Frazz with its health-nut proselytizing would've been a better example.

      I haven't read Frazz. Cathy isn't analogous, because I do understand it, at least reasonably well -- all of her complaints are, in fact, complaints middle-aged American women might issue if they were enormously self-absorbed nitwits like Cathy. The character of Cathy is alien, not the subject matter, so I feel comfortable stating that the strip has no merit. Penny Arcade might be good, for all I know. I'm inclined to stand by my original Family Circus comparison, but I haven't read Family Circus in 25, 26 years and am peering at some pretty hazy memories. Here's seven dollars.

      Marinara, or for that matter anything with tomatoes, is Krypton to a person (or cartoon) who suffers from Gastro-Intestinal Reflux Disorder (GIRD), an affliction of the pyloric valve (see Confederacy of Dunces, "My valve!") that plagues Cornelius as he mentioned in a blog post years ago.  Persons who overindulge the way Lyle seems to would also be likely candidates. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Meanwhile, "Marinara" is lately used as a flavor description for chips, and I imagine as a sauce option for say buffalo wings or something like that, thus, Regular, Intentional, or Marinara, as in how would you like that sir?

      I'm not sure which was my favorite part, either "God says we should not have opinions" or Nice Pete eating chicken like a madman.

      Do you guys smile and frown when you're eating drumsticks?  Maybe it's just me, but I think that would make a body look  <em>more</em>  insane than not.

      For me, the creepy factor was the expressionlessness while methodically snapping the bones, not the eating itself- though single-handedly downing an entire bucket of drumsticks is pretty disturbing too, come to think of it.

      For me, the creepy factor was that he was emotionlessly eating and murdering chicken drumsticks while cop roleplay sodomy was going on in an adjacent room.

      Things I adore about this strip, and Why It Is A Five: <br/> 
1. Upper-case T in "...He also wouldn't want us to have This video." <br/> 
2. " <strong>curious doctors?</strong> " <br/> 
3.  <em>He does not smile or frown.</em> <br/> 
4. The fact that "MAILBOX, CON'T" is directly after "MAILBOX MINUTE."
