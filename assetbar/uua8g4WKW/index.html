      Two logins? If that is the best caper you can come up with, your idea factory is so old and busted that the work stations are undersized because it was designed in the days when having an 8 year old work 14 hours a day was not only legal, but it was considered doing them a favor.

      Many things appear to show us that Mr. Onstad holds the canine in low regard, yet, at the same time one has also been repeatedly shown to share his domicile. Is he merely speaking of his beloved  <em>canis familiaris</em>  in a jokingly deprecating manner or was the housing of said beast a necessary pre-condition for him to continue to enjoy sexual relations?

      "Succinct" almost never describes anything I speak or write. I suspect that "needlessly verbose" is the phrase you are looking for. I'd try to become less loquacious, but I somehow lack the ability.

      The speech patterns he uses makes him out to be trying to be The Great Villain, as though this were some city that we're trying to protect from the likes of him, and he's always working on a new dastardly scheme. <br/>

But dude, this is  <em>Assetbar.</em>   That's like being a supervillain in Boise, Idaho.  It's like being Kiteman, or Triangle Man, or The Spot, or Metalhead.  Not even making it to the leagues of Boomerang Man.  All wishing your plot could be foiled by a C-list superhero like Firestorm or Timberwolf, but the best you can get is a promotional hero for a phone company or a Christian superhero from a free evangelistic comic, all refusing to use violence and half the comic is him having a vision of the Stations of the Cross. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This ain't the big leagues, man.  You're choking yourself here.

      Unless I'm mistaken for some reason Rowbox has previously related a rather terrible story of a personal acquaintance who was raped. In light of this it is entirely understandable that he would not find rape to be particularly funny; much as I assume that a person who has narrowly survived a trip to the super-secret ice cream shop or whose close friend requested extra sprinkles does not tend to enjoy  <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>  or jokes about serial killings.

      All I meant is that rape is a bad thing but sometimes I have to smirk at goofy jokes that involve it, especially if it has to do with ghosts raping humans (and for anyone who thinks I'm referencing  <em>Robot Chicken,</em>  I want it to be known that my friends and I pioneered the Ghost Rape genre of humor long before that particular episode aired).

      There's something so...  so alluring about a blank comment section.  Imagine my surprise when I see that a new Achewood is up and there are NO ASSETBAR POSTS.  Something in my brain drives me to type that accursed word... something awful and lizard-like and... nearly uncontrollable. <br/>

I will control it, I WILL NOT ALLOW THE INTERNET TO CONTROL ME! <br/>

Also, is anyone else a little creeped out by the idea of a friend specifically contracting out pornographic stories from another friend...  not just once but on multiple occasions? <br/>

On the other hand, if one of those friends is Ray - it all just makes so much sense.

I guess I see Cornelius as symbolic of everything that's become longwinded and labored about Achewood.  Remember when you didn't have to scroll down to read most strips? And they were paced out perfectly, like expert jazz licks (to use a corny but I think apt comparison)?

      Dave Sim wrote and drew a lengthy comic (ultimately setting and reaching the goal of 300 issues) called Cerebus. While he was a strong and outspoken figure for creator-owned content, self-publishing, and the rights of comic creators as opposed to the work-for-hire systems at the big two publishers he was also kind of a massive dick (especially due to strong opinions) and would cause no end of controversy relating to religion and gender (accusations of misogyny abound, but I'd go one further and state that it's not quite enough as he was an ass to both genders). I'm not even going to get into the part where he switched from being an atheist to becoming jewish/christian/muslim (yes, all three together) and inventing his own prayers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The take-away message here is that regardless of how you feel about him or his work he's a controversial figure and choosing to identify yourself with him or his works certainly says something about you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 No offense intended to joestork. It's just the ability to relate being called a dick (and the specific reasons for such) and Dave Sim is too easy to pass up.

      Dave Sim is a super weird guy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dave Sim the writer is capable of great sensitivity and depth.  Many of his best-drawn characters (in the literary sense) are female, and they are usually portrayed as anything but one-dimensional parasites.    <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dave Sim the polemicist, on the other hand, is capable of... well... saying shit like the quote above. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But so was William Burroughs, apparently.  And many others.  Not that I think they should be let off the hook, either -- but Dave Sim's reputation has been so securely tied to his politics that his near-otherworldly genius often goes unaknowledged.  I think that's a little sad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(It might also have to do with the fact that the back half of Cerebus is -- sexism aside -- both visually and thematically almost totally unreadably bananas)

      That's interesting that his misogyny doesn't show through in his work. I always suspected that Ray Bradbury was sexist because practically all of his women characters are just terrible. Not necessarily terrible in that they're not well written (that depends what you think of his writing) but in that they're totally unpleasant.

      Oh, don't get me wrong -- it shows.  Beside the fact that most of his misogynistic quotes are taken from essays inserted directly (and quite incongruously) into the fucking comic book, there is plenty of other "give away" elements -- much of the story takes place in a feminist matriarchal dystopia, for instance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's just that there's also lots of other stuff that *isn't* like that, and some stuff that seems to directly contradict his declared worldview.  Cerebus is absolutely humongous -- the guy worked on it from his early twenties to his late fifties.  He changed as a person many times over the course of writing it (and not just because of all the acid he took).  The work just cannot be boiled down to one single idea, no matter how venomous.

      Exactly. I haven't yet read through it for various reasons, but the iconic image of Dave Sim as crazy, rambling, misogynist asshole was one that could not be passed up.

      The last really good and classic-type one-off (dare I say Achewood of Antiquity, or antenuptial) that I can remember is the "Hot Tranny Mess" that we all almost missed.

How about a flashback arc of Connie's younger years on the road (note: do not just self-consciously ape  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">On The Road</span> ) or Teodor on his lonesome. Show us what these characters are capable of and then resist the urge to run every idea into the ground with numerous iterations of the same basic joke.

      That's actually good advice.  I mean GOF was basically what it was because we saw different sides of both characters, at least in my view (to use the old go-to example).

      I would be interested in seeing a solo Teodor arc.  It seems like he's always used as a straight man for other people's wackiness and never really gets a chance to shine on his own.

      I would speculate that the strip has changed because Onstad's life has changed.  He moved.  It takes a year or more to get back to the level of comfort you had in your old home.  Perhaps even longer if your old home was somewhere with which you held deep associations and memories.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
As a personal example, my wife and I have moved quite a bit in our lives.  It generally takes us 6-8 months before we hang our paintings on the walls which is a sign of accepting a location as home.  It is not a conscious decision, that is just when we start caring enough to notice that the walls are bare.

      I've heard this reasoning before here, but I don't see what compels one to favor arcs over one-offs if the arcs don't really add to the character.  Next time you see Lyle, will you be thinking of Darlene? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize this will come across as kind of aggressive (though others here have no qualms with that kind of thing), but I don't think that the current Achewood is "bad," at all.  It's just not what I think most of us prefer.  Not that we have any right that supersedes Onstad's, but I'm just saying.

      I agree.  I don't think anything is 'bad' about achewood.  It is still of a higher quality than most other webcomics.  However, the tendency of late to rehash the same joke in a couple different ways makes me think Onstad has other things on his mind once in awhile.  Its like he is stretching things out.

      Marketing <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Chupa Chups logo was designed in 1969 by Artist Salvador Dali. Its first marketing campaign was the logo with the slogan "És rodó i dura molt, Chupa Chups", which translates from Catalan as "It's round and long-lasting." Later, celebrities like Madonna were hired to advertise. In the 1980s, owing to falling birth rates, an anti-smoking slogan "Smoke Chupa Chups" was tried to attract further adult consumers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A 1970s campaign for Chupa Chups in Australia used the slogan "what a sweet half hour". <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chupa Chups ran a promotion featuring the Spice Girls with their Fantasy Ball Lollipops and Crazy Dips in 1997 and 1998. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The game Zool and its sequel Zool 2, originally produced for the Amiga, featured pervasive product placement by Chupa Chups. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They once sponsored Spanish MotoGP Rider Jorge Lorenzo. <br/>

      I remember that pornographic magazines used to have a reader's letters section, which purported to document the sexual shenanigans of the readership. All well and good. However, looking back I wonder if these stories were written in house, or did readers choose to write blue fiction, and send it in to the publication (I think even in my early teens I was pretty certain these stories did not describe real sexual events). Does anyone know? I hope its the latter, because that's pretty hilarious. Should somone submit Gladi's oeuvre to Razzle? He might turn out to be the Adolf Wolfli of badly spelled erotic fiction.

      I'm going to stick my neck out here and say that I bloody love stemless wineglasses. In wine snob terms wine from the fridge is too cold anyway, and the amount of heat you will transfer to it from your hand will be more beneficial than otherwise, but more importantly, I am very prone to dropping wineglasses when I try to hold them by the stem, and that's not classy whichever way you slice it.

      One of the reasons I clinged to Tool at the time was because they were one of the only redeeming experiences I took away from the surprisingly lackluster 1993 Lollapalooza tour (one of only two - along with the  <em>much</em>  better 1994 tour - that I ever attended).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
[I just looked at '93's line-up in order to double-check the year and I can't fucking believe that I missed Mercury Rev, though I probably wasn't ready for it yet so it doesn't really matter.]

      I've recently been listening to some old Palace mp3s from 94 (from a show in Austria), oddly enough.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's kind of weird, actually, because I probably downloaded these mp3s almost 10 years ago, and I'm only now really listening to them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess that was How I Quit Smoking era Lambchop, right?  That would've been good.  Aw Lambchop, still a top contender for my favorite band.

      They kicked ass live and I bet I'd still like some of those creepy old stop motion videos of theirs. Oh, and the end of  <em>Undertow</em>  with that weird sermon thing about the carrots or whatever. I remember liking that, too. <br/>

But no, their actual music hasn't done anything for me in fifteen years. It's not bad. It's just not my jam. <br/>

But to answer your question, you are definitely a bad - nay, a  <em>terrible</em>  - person. The fact that you listen to Tool in neither here nor there.

      Someone gave my friends' baby a talking Winnie the Pooh stuffed animal.  It says disturbing things in a plaintive voice.  "Oh, I'm ever so sleepy.  I'm going to take a nap.

      If you grew up with the A.A. Milne books then the Disney version of Winnie-the-Pooh is always pretty disturbing. You expect the character you loved in childhood, and at first it looks like him, but something's wrong. He's a depressing puppet of the bear that you knew. He's dead behind the eyes. And the decision to give him a creepy, old-man voice just made things more unsettling.

      Yeah, I had the same thing pass through my mind grapes as well. I was assuming that it was the former and this was Cornelius' attempt to demonstrate that while she wishes to appear sophisticated she is completely ignorant of fine food. She would purchase ice molds shaped like chardonnay designed by Karl Lagerfeld ($46; $227 with diamond accents, see page 27) specifically to put in her Montrachet if you made it look like it was the classy thing to do. <br/>

The average Williams-Sonoma customer is thus perfectly depicted.

      It does seem like a pretty good premise.  I think the comic from the day before yeaterday was not very funny (I don't think the Williams-Sonoma merchandise was worked into the story too well...  I expect better from Mr. Bear) but today's seems a bit more promising.

      This is also the first bit of Cornelius' writing I've genuinely liked.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know women who would buy this bowl if they read that -- the allure of so easily climbing in status and worldliness is too much for many upper middle-class women. Throw in foreign looking "pool boys who can cook" and those broads are buying them in bulk and slyly stealing their friends' copies of Williams-Sonoma from countertops during the bi-weekly wineglass-parties. After all, if everybody takes a step up, has anybody really won?

      Yeah you guys and Edwell are about the last remaining remnants of that time.  I missed out on H/FW/E - so coming on the scene late, I tried mine for but a moment.

You mean taxonomical paradox.  And only if you rearrange it and take out all its punctuation so that it's all kinds of syntactically fucked.

Certainly, one woman's blowjob giving abilities differ from the next girl's, but I personally get the sense that it is an innate ability one has. Like not being able to pee standing up without considerable practice. <br/>

      I've done it, and as fineoakstructure put it - the reality isn't as good as the image you invoke in your head.  The visual is good, but I'd even go as far as to say that even  <em>there</em>  it's got nothing on good oral.  A blowjob is, truly, a wonderful thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I've heard mixed reports about the opposite side of the coin.  Some love it, but some get weirded out at the idea of a guy getting your vaginal juices all over his la bouche.  And, of course, the first time you do it you'll probably get a UTI.  Mouths, man: petri dishes.

      In my experience a girl who doesn't like receiving head is normally fairly crazy, in a bad way. Also, a girl who makes a massive deal over how much she likes giving blow jobs is probably going to turn out quite needy and clinging. Oral sex truly is the window to the soul.

      Aw, narenial - you ain't have to play it this way. We'll be friends with you. All you have to be is nice and/or funny. <br/>

But while we're on the subject, I will submit that there is no such thing as a bad blowjob. I've had great ones and not-as-great ones, but never a bad one. There were a few that may have been a little nervous or uninspired, but hey - my dick was in a mouth. Barring cannibalism, it's hard for that arrangement to go too badly.

      That said, a coquettish nature never hurts when breaking into a new community. I realize this. I just don't want you to think you have to go that way. Unless you really want to. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some of our favorite girls here almost never talk about how they fuck. The undisputed Queen of Assetbar (sadly departed, it seems) made her name by throwing together amazingly funny MS Paint art and otherwise employing a sense of humor usually thought to be the sole property of hip, world-weary, middle-aged men. The fact that she was an attractive young girl had surprisingly little to do with her rise to prominence. Well, I can't speak for all the creep-ass motherfuckers here, but that's not why I liked her. <br/>

      Well, that's just like me to kick off a weird conversation and then disappear for the weekend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>narenial:</strong>  Forget about all that. Didn't mean to make you self-conscious. Sorry if I did. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, what are your thoughts on  <em>The Crying Light?</em>  I was kind of starting to think him a one-album wonder for a minute there (partially for the length of time that passed between his full-lengths), but I'll be damned if he didn't didn't just completely blow his debut out of the water with this one. I really should've planned a trip around seeing one of the few shows he played with a full orchestra. Regret that I didn't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>fineoakstructure:</strong>  If you have to ask, you'll never know (I don't really believe that but I like to use that line so fucking deal with it). <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>woodenteeth:</strong>  It's easy to forget or overlook, but seeking approval and being a whore are very different things. I was never implying whorishness. I was implying attention-seeking, but when all the coins are on the table why does anyone post here or anywhere else like this? To seek attention. Nothing wrong with that. I was only offering suggestions, mainly 'cause I was bored and am a bad person. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And don't try to use your Aussie mind tricks on me, brother. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>fineoakstructure:</strong>  No. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>stereo:</strong>  Yes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>tekende:</strong>  No. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>i_love_kate:</strong>  Yes.

      Well, as it turns out "undisputed" may have been a bit presumptuous. I thought her elevated status along side the average assetbar denizen was common knowledge. I'll put it this way; she may be the only person who has received more chubb-dogs from me than drskradley or the blog girl.

      Ah.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think we all know how funny autrepoupee is.  But she can't be the queen, because isn't she like a 36 year old guy?  Or is that just my own jealousy speaking? <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, as stupid as this thread has become (and I have absolute no part in that, I think this is undisputable), I would have guessed heccibiggs to get any claim to that title, as she generally seems to be one of the most well-known assetbar posters, regardless of sex or gender, and because she's been around...a long time, is how I finish that sentence.

      I love The Crying Light. I think 'I Am A Bird Now' is still my favourite of his so far, but the poignancy of the orchestration and his singing in 'The Crying Light' comes across so strongly . . . it really is an amazing album. <br/>

      I totally missed when we started talking about Anthony and the Johnsons, but I feel the need to add my opinion now. His first two albums were incredible, to my mind, (Cripple and the Starfish and Bird Gerhl are probably my two favourite songs) and I desperately need to hear anything new he's put out. Spotify go!

      I like this strip for one single reason. This strip shows Ray in midst of "Inverse Negotiation". As you can see, Connie makes makes an offer to continue writing for 60 dollars. This is highly unorthodox in and of itself but could be considered acceptable in some cultures. Ray does not return with a lower bid as is customary nor does he even agree to the sixty dollars. He offers a HIGHER price. This is inverse negotiation, essentially a display of wealth. <br/>

      Whippersnappers! The name is from history, which ya'll should learn. <br/> 
 <br/> 
From the About Achewood link: <br/> 
 <br/> 
%u201CAchewood,%u201D like wormwood, was used by antebellum slaves in the production of %u201Cachewater,%u201D a long-since outmoded and outlawed Southern beverage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Drinkers of achewater experienced hallucinations and euphoria, but the after-effects of the liquor produced a deep and lasting melancholy (hence its name). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Modern science has confirmed that achewood oil, the active ingredient in achewater, is a powerful depressant which causes irreversible neurological damage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Achewater is generally thought to have inspired many Southern folk songs and fables, such as %u201CThe Story of Poor John Ritch,%u201D %u201CSullivan%u2019s Bear and Dried Bird%u201D and %u201CI%u2019m Following a Little Round Lord.%u201D

      Another swampish July will soon be upon us, bringing with it the promise of sweltering heat, golden pitchers of ice-cold lemon-ade administered to me in enema-form, and the nightmarish prospect of sunlight which lasts until nine o'clock at night. Monstrous! When I was a lad, it was dark from five in the evening until noon the next day, and the July temperature never exceeded fifty degrees on Professor-Doktor Fahrenheit's scale. I am certain that the world is hurtling ever closer to the Sun, overbalanced as it is on one side by the overbreeding of the fecund Hindoo, but at present there is little I can do about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, if July is the cruelest month, it at least provides some relief in the form of the annual re-drilling of my cataracts. This irrigation, performed by the able hands of Doc McGillicuddy, prevents my eyes, swollen as they are with a milky, bilious substance, from bursting in the cruel heat of summer, running down my face and pooling in my lap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As the publisher of the Republic's greatest news-paper, my entire life and livelihood have been shaped by the printed word. However, I still enjoy it immensely, no matter how cruelly it has twisted my life and I believe books may be the salvation of our vile populist society, once the bad ones have been collected in great piles and set alight, and, of course, once G.K. Chesterton is hunted down and shot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Here is my reading-list for the next six weeks:  <em>The Williams-Sonoma Catalog</em>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
That Chuck Williams is my kind of guy.
