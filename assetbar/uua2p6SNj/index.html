      Friday Facts strips are Philippe's mentality and diction from soup to nuts. I don't think I'd attribute any of the punctuation or emphasis to Beef.

      Beef is also the typesetter, and one who has  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009142750/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=07052007">strong opinions about fonts</a> .   <strong><em>(BEEF/KIRK 2008!)</em></strong>   Furthermore, that is a quote of Beef himself, even if Philippe chose the quotation.  All of the punctuation and emphasis must be attributed to Beef.

      Seeing as Beef thinks, talks, and even types entirely without punctuation, he does not strike me as the kind of character with specific thoughts on how to transcribe  <strong>the way Phlippe makes his ideas</strong> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Overall I just think it's trying to explain an element of the comic that is supposed to be charming and amusing in a way too literal sense. Analyzing the logic of how these are published and formatted sucks all the fun out of it.

      I guess he's inconsistent on this, cause he talks to Ray over instant messaging sometimes without using punctuation. Then again, so do I.  <br/>

Talk without using punctuation, I mean, not talk to Ray. <br/>

      Then I struggle to understand why you started attributing the punctuation and emphasis to anyone.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If one must be literal, Onstad is the source; he gets to use any and all graphical and textual means to create the effect he wants.  Philippe's quote of Beef looks like Beef's usual speech because Onstad is conveying to us that Philippe heard it that way, and may also have reported it back to Beef by doing little impressions of Molly and Beef. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Beef does insert his own words into Friday Facts sometimes, but they are set aside in italics (and parentheses?), with a notation indicating that Beef is speaking.

      The newsletter reads exactly like Philippe's thought process, not Philippe's thought process as filtered through Beef's editing. I don't think these strips would be as charming and entertaining if we were intended to think of them as "Beef formatting Philippe's thoughts." They are great because it is the other characters as observed from Philippe's perspective. The idea of Beef deciding that his own text should be in lowercase or that  <strong>say or mean</strong>  should be in bold takes all the fun away for me. It's too literal.

      Cunt is actually a term longshoremen use meaning "an individual of great gumption or worth - salty, salt of the earth." This would explain why the lovable children's sardine was called "Cunty" and was also "the damndest little fellow."

      It's a pretty decent strip up until the end, at which point it pulls a 5. I cannot fully explain why Molly would be airing grievances about Beef while giving him a blowjob, or why she'd be so infuriated that he links her nagging with the sex stuff that they do, but it's hilarious anyways.  <br/>

      I think that's a bit messed up, because you must give a huge number of fives. I give 'automatic fives' to any strip that makes me laugh for either more than 30 seconds, or so hard it makes me cry. Both of these were achieved on the 'Ray gets sort-of stoned' strip.

      As it happens, I do give a huge number of 5s, but not always because I laughed at them. <br/>

I think it would be very boring if I parsed the definition of "physically laugh", so I'll just say that the important aspect is that the strip really surprised me with where the humor came from.

      Well due to mass Irish immigration Scotland after the potato famine, pretty much everything in most Scottish and English towns was divided in two (not Wales though because nobody likes Wales) including football teams and religion. Rangers is a Protestant football team and Celtic is a Catholic football team.

      "Is a rectum where a priest waits before he says mass?" is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while. You know how you get that sort of warm glowy feeling in your head when you say something really smart or funny? I bet Mr Onstad's head did that after he wrote that line. Then he ate some bacon or something.

      It's a Rorschach Joke. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, you figure out what it might be, such that it fits your general expectations of the strip.  If you think "Friday Facts" is likely to be funny, you'll probably think it's a funny thing and your expectations will be validated. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I look at it and just see some indecipherable doodle.  But this strip was pretty good for a Friday Facts.  Some of it was funny.

What you're seeing isn't a mutual incompatibility between two people who aren't going to get along, but the necessary fights that people will have when they're preparing to spend the rest of their lives together. I don't know why Molly gets on Beef's case after a blowjob, and maybe we'll find out later; maybe her complaints occur nowhere near any sexual activity, and she's irritated at him for not realizing that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I think that you're not extending her the benefit of the doubt. She pulls toast out of his mouth when he's too depressed to finish eating it. She's trying to help him get past his bullshit, and Beef's starting to stand up for himself too because of that. I don't see it as an unhealthy relationship at all.

      Be calm. The fact that it is vaguely reminiscent of a sexual device is part of the joke.
