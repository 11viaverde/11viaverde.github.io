      There should be a Nobel Prize for Most Creative Way Something Can Go Terribly Wrong. There should be one just so Beef can win the lifetime achievement award. It should be disbanded soon after. These were important times, and important things people needed to know, and people will always remember them fondly.

      You were experimenting with posting white space?  Why?  And why so much white space?  Why not, I don't know, 2 or three lines?  And why not, at least, at the  <em>end</em>  instead of the  <em>very first available space</em>  of the  <em>latest</em>  strip?  Why not the end of some strip from 2004? <br/>

This makes no sense.

      No.  You decided to post that white space, and it wasn't against your free will, and it doesn't matter if it was "artistic" or not.  An artist can be a troll.   <br/>

      "Queynte" is an archaic spelling of a currently quite offensive term for vaginae, although in the time that it was spelled as such it would have been much more acceptable. I'm guessing that this is the case, as it was used in the Canterbury Tales, which was originally written for recital in a courtly setting.

      I would imagine it as a pastiche of old and new genitals - seemingly clashing, but in their clashing they achieve a perceived beauty that is as non-intrinsic as the entire piece is not intrinsically a singular genitalia, due to the pastiche.

      Every time you blocked one of his combos, Foucault would use a follow-up move to convince you that even though you thought you were countering his attacks, you were actually still being hit, and there is no way to avoid this; in fact, any attacks you launch will simply backfire and hit you instead. Then you will stand completely motionless as your lifebar drops to zero. <br/>

He can, however be defeated by executing an extremely complex buttsex combo, provided that you found the secret AIDS powerup in Stage 6.

      The thing about the phrase "urethral stimulation" is not the initial shock and horror but the slow creeping sensation of utter dread that oozes up your spine the longer you think about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is not the sharp, startling appearance of the monster from the shadows or the sewer grate but the tense, ever-tightening feeling of a noose being drawn around your neck, of knowing that the call is indeed "coming from inside the house," if you will, that the murderer may in fact be your best friend or lover or other entity previously above suspicion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Urethral stimulation" will not remove your head cleanly at the base of the neck.  "Urethral stimulation" will begin with your toenails and work its way through your central nervous system, hitting every single nerve capable of sending the jolt that screams "Dear god in heaven, the pain" hurtling towards the central processing unit that is your horrified, unfathomable mind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Urethral stimulation" will leave you a gibbering wreck, begging for mercy when no mercy exists. <br/>

      Inhale. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Take in as much air as you can. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This story should last about as long as you can hold your breath, and then just a little bit longer. So listen as fast as you can. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A friend of mine, when he was thirteen years old he heard about "pegging." This is when a guy gets banged up the butt with a dildo. Stimulate the prostate gland hard enough, and the rumor is you can have explosive hands-free orgasms. At that age, this friend's a little sex maniac. He's always jonesing for a better way to get his rocks off. He goes out to buy a carrot and some petroleum jelly. To conduct a little private research. Then he pictures how it's going to look at the supermarket checkstand, the lonely carrot and petroleum jelly rolling down the conveyer belt toward the grocery store cashier. All the shoppers waiting in line, watching. Everyone seeing the big evening he has planned. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, my friend, he buys milk and eggs and sugar and a carrot, all the ingredients for a carrot cake. And Vaseline. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like he's going home to stick a carrot cake up his butt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At home, he whittles the carrot into a blunt tool. He slathers it with grease and grinds his ass down on it. Then, nothing. No orgasm. Nothing happens except it hurts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then, this kid, his mom yells it's suppertime. She says to come down, right now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He works the carrot out and stashes the slippery, filthy thing in the dirty clothes under his bed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After dinner, he goes to find the carrot and it's gone. All his dirty clothes, while he ate dinner, his mom grabbed them all to do laundry. No way could she not find the carrot, carefully shaped with a paring knife from her kitchen, still shiny with lube and stinky. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This friend of mine, he waits months under a black cloud, waiting for his folks to confront him. And they never do. Ever. Even now he's grown up, that invisible carrot hangs over every Christmas dinner, every birthday party. Every Easter egg hunt with his kids, his parents' grandkids, that ghost carrot is hovering over all of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That something too awful to name. <br/> 
 <br/> 
People in France have a phrase: "Spirit of the Stairway." In French: Esprit de l'escalier. It means that moment when you find the answer, but it's too late. Say you're at a party and someone insults you. You have to say something. So under pressure, with everybody watching, you say something lame. But the moment you leave the party%u2026 <br/> 
 <br/> 
As you start down the stairway, then -- magic. You come up with the perfect thing you should've said. The perfect crippling put-down. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's the Spirit of the Stairway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The trouble is even the French don't have a phrase for the stupid things you actually do say under pressure. Those stupid, desperate things you actually think or do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some deeds are too low to even get a name. Too low to even get talked about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Looking back, kid-psych experts, school counselors now say that most of the last peak in teen suicide was kids trying to choke while they beat off. Their folks would find them, a towel twisted around the kid's neck, the towel tied to the rod in their bedroom closet, the kid dead. Dead sperm everywhere. Of course the folks cleaned up. They put some pants on their kid. They made it look%u2026 better. Intentional at least. The regular kind of sad, teen suicide. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another friend of mine, a kid from school, his older brother in the Navy said how guys in the Middle East jack off different than we do here. This brother was stationed in some camel country where the public market sells what could be fancy letter openers. Each fancy tool is just a thin rod of polished brass or silver, maybe as long as your hand, with a big tip at one end, either a big metal ball or the kind of fancy carved handle you'd see on a sword. This Navy brother says how Arab guys get their dick hard and then insert this metal rod inside the whole length of their boner. They jack off with the rod inside, and it makes getting off so much better. More intense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's this big brother who travels around the world, sending back French phrases. Russian phrases. Helpful jack-off tips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After this, the little brother, one day he doesn't show up at school. That night, he calls to ask if I'll pick up his homework for the next couple weeks. Because he's in the hospital. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He's got to share a room with old people getting their guts worked on. He says how they all have to share the same television. All he's got for privacy is a curtain. His folks don't come and visit. On the phone, he says how right now his folks could just kill his big brother in the Navy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the phone, the kid says how -- the day before -- he was just a little stoned. At home in his bedroom, he was flopped on the bed. He was lighting a candle and flipping through some old porno magazines, getting ready to beat off. This is after he's heard from his Navy brother. That helpful hint about how Arabs beat off. The kid looks around for something that might do the job. A ball-point pen's too big. A pencil's too big and rough. But dripped down the side of the candle, there's a thin, smooth ridge of wax that just might work. With just the tip of one finger, this kid snaps the long ridge of wax off the candle. He rolls it smooth between the palms of his hands. Long and smooth and thin. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Stoned and horny, he slips it down inside, deeper and deeper into the piss slit of his boner. With a good hank of the wax still poking out the top, he gets to work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even now, he says those Arab guys are pretty damn smart. They've totally re-invented jacking off. Flat on his back in bed, things are getting so good, this kid can't keep track of the wax. He's one good squeeze from shooting his wad when the wax isn't sticking out anymore. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The thin wax rod, it's slipped inside. All the way inside. So deep inside he can't even feel the lump of it inside his piss tube. <br/> 
 <br/> 
From downstairs, his mom shouts it's suppertime. She says to come down, right now. This wax kid and the carrot kid are different people, but we all live pretty much the same life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's after dinner when the kid's guts start to hurt. It's wax so he figured it would just melt inside him and he'd pee it out. Now his back hurts. His kidneys. He can't stand straight. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This kid talking on the phone from his hospital bed, in the background you can hear bells ding, people screaming. Game shows. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The X-rays show the truth, something long and thin, bent double inside his bladder. This long, thin V inside him, it's collecting all the minerals in his piss. It's getting bigger and more rough, coated with crystals of calcium, it's bumping around, ripping up the soft lining of his bladder, blocking his piss from getting out. His kidneys are backed up. What little that leaks out his dick is red with blood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This kid and his folks, his whole family, them looking at the black X-ray with the doctor and the nurses standing there, the big V of wax glowing white for everybody to see, he has to tell the truth. The way Arabs get off. What his big brother wrote him from the Navy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the phone, right now, he starts to cry. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They paid for the bladder operation with his college fund. One stupid mistake, and now he'll never be a lawyer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sticking stuff inside yourself. Sticking yourself inside stuff. A candle in your dick or your head in a noose, we knew it was going to be big trouble. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What got me in trouble, I called it Pearl Diving. This meant whacking off underwater, sitting on the bottom at the deep end of my parents' swimming pool. With one deep breath, I'd kick my way to the bottom and slip off my swim trucks. I'd sit down there for two, three, four minutes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just from jacking off, I had huge lung capacity. If I had the house to myself, I'd do this all afternoon. After I'd finally pump out my stuff, my sperm, it would hang there in big, fat, milky gobs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After that was more diving, to catch it all. To collect it and wipe each handful in a towel. That's why it was called Pearl Diving. Even with chlorine, there was my sister to worry about. Or, Christ almighty, my Mom. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That used to be my worst fear in the world: my teenage virgin sister, thinking she's just getting fat, then giving birth to a two-headed retard baby. Both heads looking just like me. Me, the father AND the uncle. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end, it's never what you worry about that gets you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The best part of Pearl Diving was the inlet port for the swimming pool filter and the circulation pump. The best part was getting naked and sitting on it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As the French would say: Who doesn't like getting their butt sucked? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, one minute you're just a kid getting off, and the next minute you'll never be a lawyer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One minute, I'm settling on the pool bottom, and the sky is wavy, light blue through eight feet of water above my head. The world is silent except for the heartbeat in my ears. My yellow-striped swim trunks are looped around my neck for safe keeping, just in case a friend, a neighbor, anybody shows up to ask why I skipped football practice. The steady suck of the pool inlet hole is lapping at me and I'm grinding my skinny white ass around on that feeling. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One minute, I've got enough air, and my dick's in my hand. My folks are gone at their work and my sister's got ballet. Nobody's supposed to be home for hours. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My hand brings me right to getting off, and I stop. I swim up to catch another big breath. I dive down and settle on the bottom. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do this again and again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This must be why girls want to sit on your face. The suction is like taking a dump that never ends. My dick hard and getting my butt eaten out, I do not need air. My heartbeat in my ears, I stay under until bright stars of light start worming around in my eyes. My legs straight out, the back of each knee rubbed raw against the concrete bottom. My toes are turning blue, my toes and fingers wrinkled from being so long in the water. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then I let it happen. The big white gobs start spouting. The pearls. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's then I need some air. But when I go to kick off against the bottom, I can't. I can't get my feet under me. My ass is stuck. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Emergency paramedics will tell you that every year about 150 people get stuck this way, sucked by a circulation pump. Get your long hair caught, or your ass, and you're going to drown. Every year, tons of people do. Most of them in Florida. <br/> 
 <br/> 
People just don't talk about it. Not even French people talk about EVERYTHING. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Getting one knee up, getting one foot tucked under me, I get to half standing when I feel the tug against my butt. Getting my other foot under me, I kick off against the bottom. I'm kicking free, not touching the concrete, but not getting to the air, either. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still kicking water, thrashing with both arms, I'm maybe halfway to the surface but not going higher. The heartbeat inside my head getting loud and fast. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The bright sparks of light crossing and criss-crossing my eyes, I turn and look back%u2026 but it doesn't make sense. This thick rope, some kind of snake, blue-white and braided with veins has come up out of the pool drain and it's holding onto my butt. Some of the veins are leaking blood, red blood that looks black underwater and drifts away from little rips in the pale skin of the snake. The blood trails away, disappearing in the water, and inside the snake's thin, blue-white skin you can see lumps of some half-digested meal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's the only way this makes sense. Some horrible sea monster, a sea serpent, something that's never seen the light of day, it's been hiding in the dark bottom of the pool drain, waiting to eat me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So%u2026 I kick at it, at the slippery, rubbery knotted skin and veins of it, and more of it seems to pull out of the pool drain. It's maybe as long as my leg now, but still holding tight around my butthole. With another kick, I'm an inch closer to getting another breath. Still feeling the snake tug at my ass, I'm an inch closer to my escape. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Knotted inside the snake, you can see corn and peanuts. You can see a long bright-orange ball. It's the kind of horse-pill vitamin my Dad makes me take, to help put on weight. To get a football scholarship. With extra iron and omega-three fatty acids. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's seeing that vitamin pill that saves my life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not a snake. It's my large intestine, my colon pulled out of me. What doctors call, prolapsed. It's my guts sucked into the drain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Paramedics will tell you a swimming pool pump pulls 80 gallons of water every minute. That's about 400 pounds of pressure. The big problem is we're all connected together inside. Your ass is just the far end of your mouth. If I let go, the pump keeps working - unraveling my insides -- until it's got my tongue. Imagine taking a 400-pound shit, and you can see how this might turn you inside out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I can tell you is your guts don't feel much pain. Not the way your skin feels pain. The stuff you're digesting, doctor's call it fecal matter. Higher up is chyme, pockets of a thin runny mess studded with corn and peanuts and round green peas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's all this soup of blood and corn, shit and sperm and peanuts floating around me. Even with my guts unraveling out my ass, me holding onto what's left, even then my first want is to somehow get my swimsuit back on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
God forbid my folks see my dick. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My one hand holding a fist around my ass, my other hand snags my yellow-striped swim trunks and pulls them from around my neck. Still, getting into them is impossible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You want to feel your intestines, go buy a pack of those lamb-skin condoms. Take one out and unroll it. Pack it with peanut butter. Smear it with petroleum jelly and hold it under water. Then, try to tear it. Try to pull it in half. It's too tough and rubbery. It's so slimy you can't hold on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A lamb-skin condom, that's just plain old intestine. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You can see what I'm up against. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You let go for a second, and you're gutted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You swim for the surface, for a breath, and you're gutted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You don't swim, and you drown. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's a choice between being dead right now or a minute from right now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What my folks will find after work is a big naked fetus, curled in on itself. Floating in the cloudy water of their backyard pool. Tethered to the bottom by a thick rope of veins and twisted guts. The opposite of a kid hanging himself to death while he jacks off. This is the baby they brought home from the hospital thirteen years ago. Here's the kid they hoped would snag a football scholarship and get an MBA. Who'd care for them in their old age. Here's all their hopes and dreams. Floating here, naked and dead. All around him, big milky pearls of wasted sperm. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Either that or my folks will find me wrapped in a bloody towel, collapsed halfway from the pool to the kitchen telephone, the ragged, torn scrap of my guts still hanging out the leg of my yellow-striped swim trunks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What even the French won't talk about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That big brother in the Navy, he taught us one other good phrase. A Russian phrase. The way we say: "I need that like I need a hole in my head%u2026" Russian people say: "I need that like I need teeth in my asshole%u2026" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mne eto nado kak zuby v zadnitse <br/> 
 <br/> 
Those stories about how animals caught in a trap will chew off their leg, well, any coyote would tell you a couple bites beats the hell out of being dead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hell%u2026 even if you're Russian, some day you just might want those teeth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Otherwise, what you have to do is -- you have to twist around. You hook one elbow behind your knee and pull that leg up into your face. You bite and snap at your own ass. You run out of air, and you will chew through anything to get that next breath. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not something you want to tell a girl on the first date. Not if you expect a kiss good night. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I told you how it tasted, you would never, ever again eat calamari. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's hard to say what my parents were more disgusted by: how I'd got in trouble or how I'd saved myself. After the hospital, my Mom said, "You didn't know what you were doing, honey. You were in shock." And she learned how to cook poached eggs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All those people grossed out or feeling sorry for me%u2026 <br/> 
 <br/> 
I need that like I need teeth in my asshole. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nowadays, people always tell me I look too skinny. People at dinner parties get all quiet and pissed off when I don't eat the pot roast they cooked. Pot roast kills me. Baked ham. Anything that hangs around inside my guts for longer than a couple hours, it comes out still food. Home-cooked lima beans or chunk light tuna fish, I'll stand up and find it still sitting there in the toilet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After you have a radical bowel resectioning, you don't digest meat so great. Most people, you have five feet of large intestine. I'm lucky to have my six inches. So I never got a football scholarship. Never got an MBA. Both my friends, the wax kid and the carrot kid, they grew up, got big, but I've never weighed a pound more than I did that day when I was thirteen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another big problem was my folks paid a lot of good money for that swimming pool. In the end my Dad just told the pool guy it was a dog. The family dog fell in and drowned. The dead body got pulled into the pump. Even when the pool guy cracked open the filter casing and fished out a rubbery tube, a watery hank of intestine with a big orange vitamin pill still inside, even then, my Dad just said, "That dog was fucking nuts." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even from my upstairs bedroom window, you could hear my Dad say, "We couldn't trust that dog alone for a second%u2026" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then my sister missed her period. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even after they changed the pool water, after they sold the house and we moved to another state, after my sister's abortion, even then my folks never mentioned it again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is our invisible carrot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You. Now you can take a good, deep breath. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still have not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
End

      I thought this review from Salon was pretty hilarious: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Imagine some crappy novels. Imagine that they're all written in the same phony, repetitive, bombastic style as this paragraph, all hopped-up imperatives and posturing one-liners. Imagine that they're sloppily put together. Imagine that everything even remotely clever in them has been done before and better by someone else. Imagine that each one flaunts the kind of "research" that can be achieved by leafing through a trade magazine for 30 minutes and is riddled with grating errors. Imagine that these books traffic in the half-baked nihilism of a stoned high school student who has just discovered Nietzsche and Nine-Inch Nails. Does it hurt yet? Now, imagine that every five pages or so the author of these novels will describe something as smelling like shit or piss because the TRUTH is fucking ugly, man. Imagine that he affects to attack the shallow, simplistic, dehumanizing culture of commodity capitalism by writing shallow, simplistic, dehumanized fiction." <br/> 
 <br/> 
... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Reading this is like being cornered by a dimwitted and semi-belligerent drunk possessed by an idée fixe he keeps reciting over and over again, jabbing your shoulder each time."

      TO BE A COOL CRITIC: Exaggerate your target's writing style until it seems clownish and thumb-fingered. Add a caricature of what you think his typical fans are-- because obviously an author can't be any good if the people who like him are  <em>losers</em> . Make references to other authors who have "done this before, only better"-- never, ever name them, however, or acknowledge any possible differences between them and this author that might have made him famous and them fade into obscurity. Remember, the idea is that you are so supremely educated in the history of writing you don't even  <em>have</em>  to back up your incredibly clever review with specific references-- the reader already knows that you have earned the right to vaguely mention "someone else" who was "better", you are a Critic and you are the Law. <br/>

      I actually saw some guy just the other day (on a web site) who had apparently gotten some odd graphic symbol inked on his equipage.

And what about the pain?! <br/>

I'm not one for piercings either.  The first time I saw a Prince Albert - in a bathhouse in Denver some 35 years ago - I confess my courage failed me and I fled (the Prince Albert and the gentleman to whom it was attached, not the bathhouse).

      My thanks for the props, JC!  Of course, back in the day hanging at the baths wasn't old school; it was the coolest cool.  Being mad rutty wasn't just an occasional diversion, it was a way of life, a calling.  In a place like Denver, the baths were the maximum Church of Rut, with the most variety of mise-en-scene, the greatest potential of quantity and quality of worship. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I moved to New York I found a much more developed Church culture.  In retrospect I'm amazed I got anything at all done (like making something of a living), since an astonishing amount of my time was spent perfecting my Mad Rutty Skills.  I say of myself in that time that it was like someone left the gate open and the dog got out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was a terrific time, even with all the horrific stuff that followed on its heels.  Myself,  <em>I'm</em>  impressed I'm still around, navigating my way into curmudgeonly dotage.

      Man I'm so sick of white people accusin me of cookin my forcemeat in their daughters' ovens they need to recognize that there are ramifications to these false accusations which lead to making generalizations about my generation which has various implications in terms of forms of degradation and when you get down to it, it's a nation of player-hation because to wrongfully accuse a man of rape  <em>is another form of rape</em>  except for those crackas at Duke University man I know they did that shit but anyway We ain't came on no Plymouth Cock, Plymouth Cock  <em>came on us</em>  and if you need more proof of the truth of that well then flibberty gibbert and a rat-a-tat-tat <br/>

Bitch I ain't even got to make sense no more <br/> 
Because I live in a country that's nonsense to the core <br/> 
Y'all suckas talk about the fathers that went before <br/> 
But it ain't relevant to me man it's all folklore <br/> 
Before you say I'm the reason you're wife's pussy got tore <br/> 
Ask yourself why your woman acts like such a whore <br/> 
The only revolution comin to break down your door <br/> 
Will spread peace and love, not blood and gore <br/> 
Now I know I sound like Will Smith in days of yore <br/> 
When he was with Jazzy Jeff and he was just a bore <br/> 
(Well at least he had yet to get jiggy, which white Boomers adore) <br/> 
But I need to get my point across before my throat gets sore: <br/> 
We need understanding in order to reach an accord <br/> 
From the same cup we'll sip, the same pitcher, we'll pour <br/> 
So quit yellin about the flag pins some guy wore <br/> 
And be glad that the man's got some plans in store

      She is slowly realizing that her love cannot change this man. She cannot simply undo all the damage of a life lived under the duress of an overbearing old woman -- of constant attempts to fulfill desires and try new things thwarted by a lack of resources both financial and familial -- by putting a couple of rings on their fingers and wearing matching cargo shorts. Beef is an experienced man who has been taught many wrong lessons in his life, a tragic perversion of what a  <em>bildungsroman</em>  ought to be, too depressing to garner empathy, too hilarious to be deeply moving.

      I can launch us into a heated discussion about how sexist it is that women are expected to trim, shave, or wax their pubes, while it seems silly and unreasonable to ask men to do the same.

      It'd be hard to start this heated discussion with me, because I generally agree with you on discussion of gender roles, if you haven't noticed.  It's just hard to make it known to people that I've studied feminism and gender roles (on my own time, so not university-level by any means), namely because I'm a dude and most dudes don't think about it.  Being a guy in...well, any society, is kinda like being a Yankee white person who just moved to the South in the early 20th Century: you know the other people are oppressed and objectified, but life is so much easier for you that after a while it can start to eat away at you, until you've nearly become the very thing you were so adamantly against. <br/>

      Also, in a completely unintelligent personal reference to the discussion, and not at all an example for the sake of a point of argument: I trim.  It's easier to clean, feels better, makes my johnson look bigger (a plus for my self-esteem, the wife doesn't care), and the lack of little hairs to get caught in one's teeth makes it more pleasant for my wife (everybody wins this).  I see no down-sides, except that if I trim it too short just above my man-rod then the sharp whiskers are right at clitoris height, but only for like a day, and we work around this.

      I had a friend whose girlfriend convinced her to let him shave his balls. Every night for the next two weeks he would either call or IM me to complain about the horrible itching and chafing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think trimming the upper area is to be encouraged. But I can't even imagine how the shaving of the, um, pouch would go. I mean it's not exactly a level surface, nor is there any firm resistance. It'd be like a dude asking you to shave your labia. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now I'm wondering if it's possible for a girl to have hairy labias. I do not like this conversation anymore.

      Chelsea.  That's such a beautiful name. <br/>

My fortune teller told me I would fall in love with a beautiful maiden called Chelsea from the Internet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It has to be you. <br/>

(It's called a Glasgow and a Chealsea.  Wikipedia exists for a reason, you know).

Re: straight razors.  Kids, if you still have your hair cut at a barbershop, this is what a barber uses to shave the nape of your neck.  It also appears in old blues songs as a main weapon of scorned lovers and people who are having a wild night.

      It's easy, you just need to stretch the skin out to make a flat surface, and go all around. You might nick yourself one or twice, but it heals up fast. And the itching gets less and less each time you do it. I'm now a fully-converted shaving devotee. Certain areas are just that bit more sensitive when not coated in hair. <br/>

But don't shave the triangle, no-one wants you to look like a 12-year old.

      I concur, except that many guys actually do trim. Once they figure out it makes them look bigger, and that it makes a girl more apt to give them head, they come around. (Heh.) And those that don't, should. I'm totally with you on the shaving/waxing front for ladies though-- the trend towards being entirely bare kinda weirds me out. I mean, I was 10 once.

      I agree with you both, bald lady parts do nothing for me, and are a little disturbing, but I am equally put off by the '70s style crotch fro that some girls feel the need to sport.  Things should be kept somewhat neat and trimmed down there, and this is not just aimed at ladies.  To any dude who wants his lady to trim or shave her crotchular region, but is unwilling to maintain his own:  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">You are an asshole</span> .

      Back in the late 90's, when that Criminal video was on MTV all the time, Fiona Apple had the body of an 11 year old boy.   <em>Not really my thing</em> .   <br/>

Otherwise, she's kind of attractive (nice, not my type), but I always thought a friend of mine who called her something similar to "insanely hot" was stretching it.

In that clip she's thin and she isn't well endowed but I don't think that makes her akin to a 11 year old boy. That's a little unfair to the naturally thin, flatter chested ladies. I'm sure you weren't tryin to be mean though.

      Well, I was just always put off by the quick bit where you see her in her underwear.  Normally, I'd be all for that, but my first thought was "man, that looks like  <em>my</em>  ass when I was 11."  She also had that late 90's quasi-heroin chic look, another asinine trend that I was never fond of.  There's a different between being thin and flat chested and looking emaciated and bruised.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I thought and still think that her talent is overrated. <br/>

      The voices of Fiona Apple, Regina Spektor, and Tori Amos all go out for wild nights on the town, getting drunk in bars and just living it up. <br/>

Joanna Newsom watches from outside, her hand pressed against the glass of a cold window. She has not been invited. She will never be invited.

      Man, don't even through Joanna Newsom anywhere near that VH1-friendly, drama-chick-coddling, ivory-dry-humping masturbatory horse shit.  Is there some RIAA by-law requiring every lable to have an unconventionally attractive piano playing  <strong>kinda kooky(!)</strong>  (but in that Borders kind of way) overwrought spastic on the payroll?  Is this what people turn to when Vanessa Carlton and Vienna Teng go "too mainstream?"

      I tried to respond to your brilliantly insightful review of Fiona Apple's hotness, but I was stuck at work, and unable to tear myself away for long enough to express my innermost thoughts on the subject.  Though generations may suffer for my not having committed it here to writing, you may exist knowing that it not only complemented your own eternal thoughts, but also raised the standards of such comments, and of commenting itself, to a level unknown for years to come.  It...was... <em>breathtaking</em> ... <br/>

      Because she thought that the idea of having her do it for him might be sexy enough that he would agree, whereas he would probably not agree to do it himself, and also telling him to do it himself might sound like she is unhappy with his junk as it is.

      Molly should get him by now though and know he would put up a stink because it's a whole Thing To Do, and Extremely Correct.  Or at least that's what I would figure.  But her typical compassion does indeed come through in the way you described.

      I really think one of the least sexy things a couple can do is shave each other, or really, any other hygiene activities.  The absolute least sexual thing.  As far as your partner should know, you wake up gleaming and flawless, ready to take on each new day with your freshly and mysteriously laundered genitals. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've got to imagine most people agree with this, and use the "oh baby lets shave the night together!" as a gentle way of saying "TAKE THAT SHIT OFF YOUR SHAMEZONE FOR THE LOVE OF PETE"

      Showering together can be very erotic and makes for wonderful foreplay, so I can't rule out all hygiene-related activities, but I agree that shaving each other is kind of weird.  An ex-girlfriend talked me into participating in this activity once, it took me like half an hour to shave her because I was terrified that I would slip and cut her in her most delicate of areas, and eventually she gave up and finished it herself.  On the other side of things, the speed with which she shaved me was both remarkable and scary.  The novelty of bald naughty bits made the sexy times more fun initially, but that quickly wore off and was replaced by the horrible itching that comes a day or two after shaving off your pubes.  Overall, the experience was not good, and I would not do it again.

      Five hours, (and who can do it less in?) <br/> 
By haughty Celia spent in dressing; <br/> 
The goddess from her chamber issues, <br/> 
Arrayed in lace, brocades, and tissues. <br/> 
Strephon, who found the room was void <br/> 
And Betty otherwise employed, <br/> 
Stole in and took a strict survey <br/> 
Of all the litter as it lay; <br/> 
Whereof, to make the matter clear, <br/> 
An inventory follows here. <br/> 
And first a dirty smock appeared, <br/> 
Beneath the arm-pits well besmeared. <br/> 
Strephon, the rogue, displayed it wide <br/> 
And turned it round on every side. <br/> 
On such a point few words are best, <br/> 
And Strephon bids us guess the rest; <br/> 
And swears how damnably the men lie <br/> 
In calling Celia sweet and cleanly. <br/> 
Now listen while he next produces <br/> 
The various combs for various uses, <br/> 
Filled up with dirt so closely fixt, <br/> 
No brush could force a way betwixt. <br/> 
A paste of composition rare, <br/> 
Sweat, dandruff, powder, lead and hair; <br/> 
A forehead cloth with oil upon't <br/> 
To smooth the wrinkles on her front. <br/> 
Here alum flower to stop the steams <br/> 
Exhaled from sour unsavory streams; <br/> 
There night-gloves made of Tripsy's hide, <br/> 
Bequeath'd by Tripsy when she died, <br/> 
With puppy water, beauty's help, <br/> 
Distilled from Tripsy's darling whelp; <br/> 
Here gallypots and vials placed, <br/> 
Some filled with washes, some with paste, <br/> 
Some with pomatum, paints and slops, <br/> 
And ointments good for scabby chops. <br/> 
Hard by a filthy basin stands, <br/> 
Fouled with the scouring of her hands; <br/> 
The basin takes whatever comes, <br/> 
The scrapings of her teeth and gums, <br/> 
A nasty compound of all hues, <br/> 
For here she spits, and here she spews. <br/> 
But oh! it turned poor Strephon's bowels, <br/> 
When he beheld and smelt the towels, <br/> 
Begummed, besmattered, and beslimed <br/> 
With dirt, and sweat, and ear-wax grimed. <br/> 
No object Strephon's eye escapes: <br/> 
Here petticoats in frowzy heaps; <br/> 
Nor be the handkerchiefs forgot <br/> 
All varnished o'er with snuff and snot. <br/> 
The stockings, why should I expose, <br/> 
Stained with the marks of stinking toes; <br/> 
Or greasy coifs and pinners reeking, <br/> 
Which Celia slept at least a week in? <br/> 
A pair of tweezers next he found <br/> 
To pluck her brows in arches round, <br/> 
Or hairs that sink the forehead low, <br/> 
Or on her chin like bristles grow. <br/> 
The virtues we must not let pass, <br/> 
Of Celia's magnifying glass. <br/> 
When frighted Strephon cast his eye on't <br/> 
It shewed the visage of a giant. <br/> 
A glass that can to sight disclose <br/> 
The smallest worm in Celia's nose, <br/> 
And faithfully direct her nail <br/> 
To squeeze it out from head to tail; <br/> 
(For catch it nicely by the head, <br/> 
It must come out alive or dead.) <br/> 
Why Strephon will you tell the rest? <br/> 
And must you needs describe the chest? <br/> 
That careless wench! no creature warn her <br/> 
To move it out from yonder corner; <br/> 
But leave it standing full in sight <br/> 
For you to exercise your spite. <br/> 
In vain, the workman shewed his wit <br/> 
With rings and hinges counterfeit <br/> 
To make it seem in this disguise <br/> 
A cabinet to vulgar eyes; <br/> 
For Strephon ventured to look in, <br/> 
Resolved to go through thick and thin; <br/> 
He lifts the lid, there needs no more: <br/> 
He smelt it all the time before. <br/> 
As from within Pandora's box, <br/> 
When Epimetheus oped the locks, <br/> 
A sudden universal crew <br/> 
Of humane evils upwards flew, <br/> 
He still was comforted to find <br/> 
That Hope at last remained behind; <br/> 
So Strephon lifting up the lid <br/> 
To view what in the chest was hid, <br/> 
The vapours flew from out the vent. <br/> 
But Strephon cautious never meant <br/> 
The bottom of the pan to grope <br/> 
And foul his hands in search of Hope. <br/> 
 <br/> 
... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thus finishing his grand survey, <br/> 
Disgusted Strephon stole away <br/> 
Repeating in his amorous fits, <br/> 
 <em>Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits!</em> <br/>

      <strong>IT'S TIME TO FIGHT: AN EPIC RECOLLECTION(?) OF MY TRIALS</strong> <br/> 
The snow on the colosseum floor was melting as I stumbled around circling my opponent, the gladiator champion Gon.  It is branded into my head like an image left too long on a plasma screen TV: blood from his last 4 kills dripping off the tip of his poison-tipped spear. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glancing down to my buckler and gladius, I raise my arm to prepare for an attack but when I take a look(?) down, I see a bulge coming out of my gladiator kilt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was my penis, [i]the fighting had given me a boner.[/b] <br/> 
Regaining my bearing, I looked back up at Gon to see where he was--when I was attacked by the spear of Gon--I quickly reacted and deflected the blow (for one hit of it would fatally poison me to death) and regroup my footing <br/> 
 <br/> 
The stars match renews <br/> 
 <br/> 
Tired of waiting, I now charge forth with a brutal charge and take Gon off guard and he stumbles.  I make a quick slice at his arm and retreat back to my position, a smile forms on my mouth, I cannot help it.  Angered by the attack, Gon comes at me with everything he has and strikes multiple times but I block every one with my buckler or gladius, when all of a sudden an opening opens up in his guard and I strike a death blow to his kidney.  Overwhelmed with joy, I lower my buckler arm and he gets a strike in under my armpit as his last action on this planet and dooms me to a poisony death. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I take 15 steps and die from the poison. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am hungry for something fresh.  Mom, would you please make me something tasty, what you make is the best.  If you are tired, then just tell me one thing.  Were you lying, or am I the best? <br/> 
 <br/> 
That was a poem I wrote, thanks, all of you.

      Man so I love the anachronistic flavor of Roman-style gladiatorial combat being burned into one's brain like "an image left too long on a plasma screen." <br/>

      i only have one story about diy-denuding. i had a gf who rolled up one day with a bottle of nair. i'm not sure how we had got to the idea in the first place but apparently that was her method of choice for removing all the stuff down there, left over from when she was on the swim team or something. not knowing much about it and never having seen her naughty bits in such a state i was of course pretty much willing to go along with anything at that point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
anyway i was looking at the bottle and they say stuff like you should test a small patch beforehand. luckily i was trained from an early age to follow this type of direction on an ointment so applied only a bit about the size of a quarter. she proceeded to do her thing and i just waited. anyway it's not really feeling that good to me but i've never used nair before so what do i know. after about 10 minutes though it feels like someone has poured lighter fluid over the area just above my stuff and set it ablaze. "is it..supposed to feel like burning?" i ask her and she's kind of laughing it off like i'm making it up or whatever. so i'm like, well, she seems cool with it so i gotta be a man about this and ride it out. but about 5 more minutes i can't take it anymore and basically i give up and wipe it off and lo and behold, it's smooth as a baby's bottom, one that has something between like a 2nd and 3rd degree chemical burn on it. exceptionally uncomfortable!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
now she suggests some home therapy thing her mom knows about that you are supposed to put a piece of potato on a burn like that. i had to do a report in health class on burns and i never heard shit about this but well, i'm basically in excruciating pain, and she is from india and her mom seems like a smart lady, so i figure maybe there is some exotic home remedy about this and at this point i'm willing to try about anything. well, her mom is like a civil rights lawyer and yet would still surprise you by saying crazy racist shit about how pakistanis are very dirty so i guess that i should've known there was a good chance she wasn't right about all stuff, particularly about nair burns either since basically it made it go from "a painful burn" to "white hot blinding searing burn" ..  anyway it took almost a week to heal, and would feel like someone shoved a knife in there any time my undies rubbed up against it the wrong way. then it would just itch uncontrollably for another week. but, i will say it was pretty sexy having that little bald spot on there after that.

      Oh my lord. Just look at [url=https://www.menarebetterthanwomen.com]this[url]. This is one of the most hilarious things I have come across in a while. The guy who runs the site says he's not joking, but I refuse to believe this is for real. I mean: <br/> 
"Women walk into a situation and before you know it they%u2019ve completely changed their wardrobe and mannerisms as if they%u2019ve joined a fucking cult. Men are not sheep. Everyone knows the word for a female sheep is ewe, but what about the male word? There isn%u2019t one because sheep is something men are not." <br/> 
(From the Top Ten Reasons Men Are Better Than Women) <br/> 
And look at some of the comments for "Why women hate sex": <div class="img_container"><img alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100112105828im_/https://i33.tinypic.com/2rpv29i.jpg" style="border:0px;"/></div> <br/>

      I would like to point out that my grandfather virtually invented the Glen of Imaal terrier, in (unsuprisingly) the Glen of Imaal, in Wicklow, Ireland in the 30s and 40s. So this is a hell cool reference for me.

      Beef's got a point. Friend of mine with an exotic blood disease trimmed for his lady and got an ingrown hair, which eventually got pretty awful. He ended up with a staph infection that resulted in a piece of his rectum and leg getting chopped off, and then a jalapeno seed got stuck in the wound and he had to remove it with a water-pik.
