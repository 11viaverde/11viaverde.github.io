      ...which we wouldn't HAVE TO DO, if people would just use the lames the way they were MEANT TO BE USED rather than going lame-happy on any opinions that disagree with theirs. The fact that everyone has their limit set to 100 anyway shows how useless the lames have become. I can't believe Onstad has done nothing about this. A system that would at least make SOME SENSE is changing to something like YouTube where Lames and Chubbies would just be on the same spectrum (1 Lame = -1 Chubby). But whatever. It's the Internet.

      "On Thursday, April 5, 1750, I went to see a most deplorable object of a child, born the night before of one Mary Evans in 'Chas'town. It was surprising to all who beheld it, and I scarcely know how to describe it. The skin was dry and hard and seemed to be cracked in many places, somewhat resembling the scales of a fish. The mouth was large and round and open. It had no external nose, but two holes where the nose should have been. The eyes appeared to be lumps of coagulated blood, turned out, about the bigness of a plum, ghastly to behold. It had no external ears, but holes where the ears should be. The hands and feet appeared to be swollen, were cramped up and felt quite hard. The back part of the head was much open. It made a strange kind of noise, very low, which I cannot describe. It lived about forty-eight hours and was alive when I saw it."

      Why would he wish to be someone who never wrote a book as good as his own? You can throw Hemingway at him all day and McCarthy would just be like "Two words: Blood Meridian" (Except he'd probably do it without the punctuation)

      Basically put any amount of arms on a man and he will beat Ray at pool. <br/>

I am able to imagine Ray being so bad at all. He goes to shoot, concentrating heavily, lips and brow crooked, he mutters "It's about to get REAL, doggie!" and kind of nudges the top of the ball with a very hard shot, making it roll slowly and stop right next to the target ball.
