      The night is dark. The sky sheds snow like dandruff. In his tower room in the Cathedral, lordhumungus  scribbles hurriedly in his journal.  His tongue sticks out of the corner of his mouth in concentration. His cuffs are stained with blood - or is it  <em>ink</em>  ? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Suddenly a voice disturbs the storm of his tumultuous thoughts. "So it's YOU! I should have known. That's not even how you SPELL "humongous".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
lordhumungus stares around, eyes wide with terror. "Wh-who's there?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
A figure steps from the shadows, revealing his double-breasted coat and fedora. "Biff Knight, Language Dick!" He shifted a little, and the candle-light glinted off his magnifying glass, which seemed permanently fused to his eye. "Sorry to be one."

      Yeah, I just wanted to make it clear that while it was a monocle  <em>now</em> , it  <em>used</em>  to be magnifying glass. Also it's not held on by sheer force of will and chubby cheeks and a chain, as most monocles seem to be. <br/>

      I came home from work, saw plummet's comment, wrote and deleted muddled responses while talking on the phone and watching ESPN...I couldn't get the phrasing quite right.  Then I passed out for an hour and a half. I woke up and realized I was late for going out drinking.  3.5 hours later, I came home and saw this comment, achilleselbow.

      I am a supperphone and proud of it. <br/> 
My mother told me that supper would be done in fifteen minutes and I believed her because  <em>only heathens eat dinner.</em> <br/> 
Seriously.  I like the word supper better because it is just a little odd, and I like using words that are a little odd.

Of course, I'd also eat human children rather than starve to death. Probably well before human adults too. I might not even need to be starving at all. <br/>

Am I the only person who really, really wants to try some human meat? Not by killing people of course, but maybe something cloned or grown in a vat or freely donated. It just galls me at a very basic level to not have the option.

      This is very strange because I was talking with my daughter a few hours ago, and she said she had a dream last night about eating human flesh. It looked like a ham, and she didn't know it was human. All grease dripping down her chin. Actually, she was in a cooking course, learning how it was done. <br/>

      The original meaning of "supper" is a meal with cold meat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As opposed to the original meaning of "dinner," a meal with hot meat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Originally, dinner came in the middle of the day, and was the chief meal.  Supper came at the end of the day, and consisted of leftovers from dinner. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Current usage varies, depending on what your mom called it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, the general term for a gathering that convenes around a table to eat is a "dinner party."  You also see the term "fine dining."  So there is a bit of cultural prejudice towards the word "dinner" in that context.  In that case Beef's use of the term "supper party" does seem a little provincial. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But any arguing over which is the correct term for which meal at which time of day has no possible resolution.

      Throughout Wisconsin, you can find a " <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925100517/https://www.michaelssupperclub.com/">Supperclub</a> " or two in each town. <br/>

Often the scene of many a wedding reception, they are seen as the "dress up" establishment of the area.  (Meaning, your Church Khakis and non-holey long-sleeved flannel shirt.)  In any case, I am not going there expecting cold remnants from a midday meal left unfinished.

It's not a historical thing, but a regional one. In most of continental Europe, this is still the case. What is usually translated as "dinner" is a big meal that's eaten somewhere between noon and 3pm. "Supper" is a smaller meal eaten around 8 or so.

      It's not so much about where I'm from, because I and one of my friends are the only people I know who prefer to say supper, while almost every other person I have ever met says dinner. It is also what my mother said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dinner is a meal you give a shit about eating, and maybe there are two kinds of forks. <br/> 
Supper is laid-back, casual, and usually eaten on the couch or at the computer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Supper is the preferred meal of those who came from Circumstances (or haven't left them yet).

      Well, if you mean that your family are simple people, and yet not of low mind, I can understand that.

      Only two kinds of forks? That's pretty low. I mean, I typically use at least two kinds of forks fairly often. It is quite impossible and amazingly horrible to eat an entree with your salad fork or try to manhandle a salad with a too-large entree fork. But mainly you don't want to pass tastes across. That's not even considering the possible need for a dessert fork/spoon.

      Unfortunately not. The artist is unknown, but I feel that he was haunted by images of cats, mercilessly mocking him with their sadistic glee. He could never be happy with his work, for the pieces themselves stared up at him, destroying his self-esteem with their impertinent, rosy tongues. <br/>

      Yeah, that does sound pretty much like Wain. Except the "mercilessly mocking...sadistic glee" part. I think cats (real and in his art) were his only true comfort, even as they were morphing into vaguely nightmarish geometric explosions as his mind got away from him.

      It was beautiful, a Photoshop foul tip followed by a walk-off internet home run.  Despite recognition of the image, I felt briefly compelled to reply with a Beef-centric set of parody lyrics to  <em>Thick as a Brick</em> .  Something about the imagery and maybe the avatar?  There is something about monopoly in that song.  Fortunately, I soon realized this would have been a Bad Idea. <br/>

      On xkcd forums, someone told me that they didn't want to live past 35, and that on their 35th birthday they will go to Europe with his friend, travel all around getting as high as possible, and then go to the Colliseum and have a sword fight.  The one who kills the other kills himself. <br/>

      And the thing is is that he is a big figure on the boards.  I thought everyone there was supposed to be a nerdy genius.  35?  Really?  I don't want to be a geezer either, but you can still function well into your 60s, right? <br/> 
 <br/> 
So now he's doing drugs now, because he doesn't want to be old, and there is no way that he would decide when he is 34 that maybe he wants to live a little longer, but no, now he's a nicotine/cocaine/paintfume/heroin addicted drop out in life.

      There are a lot of people here, sje. I think it'd be kind of fucked up if every single person here liked something all at once. However, I'm intrigued. Let's see if we can't nail down a couple of basic ones. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Movie: I want to say  <em>Rushmore,</em>  but I can never keep track of whether it's internet trendy to hate or like Wes Anderson on any given week. That and pogo probably hasn't seen it. Maybe  <em>Alien?</em>   <em>The Graduate?</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Book: No. On second thought I'm not even gonna try that one. I've already heard people here say that they don't like  <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>  and  <em>Slaughterhouse 5,</em>  and I can't think of any more universally appealing stories.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Band: Beatles (I wanted to say Pixies, but you've repeatedly asserted that you only like three bands so I knew that wouldn't work) <br/> 
 <br/> 
OK. That didn't work. Never mind.

      I love  <em>Rushmore, The Graduate</em> , and both books.  Plus the Beatles, of course. <br/>

Might I suggest some Coen flicks?   <em>The Big Lebowski</em>  seems big here, even though I haven't seen it yet;  <em>Fargo</em>  and  <em>Raising Arizona</em>  are favorites of mine; maybe they're also big here?  Eh, whatever.  It's not something we should dissect.

      Yeah, I hadn't thought about the Coens.  <em>Lebowski</em>  is one of the best movies ever made, but for mass appeal I think  <em>Fargo</em>  is a safer bet.  <em>No Country for Old Men</em>  could eventually enter into it, but it may not have had enough time to sink in with everyone yet.

      Book: Ender's Game? There's not a lot of people who didn't like that one, and pretty much everyone has read it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Movie: I would hazard a guess at The Shawshank Redemption, mostly because it is according to IMDb the best movie ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Music: Fuck no there isn't any music that everyone loves. Except Flight of the Conchords, probably.

      I guess you'll be shocked to hear that I have never read any Orson Scott Card. It's never even been suggested to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Shawshank</em>  is an ultra-safe bet. I mean, it's obviously not the best movie ever, or whatever, but I've never met someone who didn't at least  <em>like</em>  it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And sorry, but my appreciation for Flight of the Conchords is mainly limited to their acting and (I'm guessing) their scriptwriting. The musical interludes are invariably my least favorite part. You don't like the Beatles? I thought they were a shoo-in for that category.

      That's funny, because I like FOTC more for the music than the acting, although there are some funny bits in the show, must of it is predicated on the music, although to some extent it goes both ways (you don't enjoy Leggy Blonde so much without knowing the backstory.)

      See, I've never seen more than 2 skits of their show and they were both songs; I've only seen their Comedy Central Presents and various other solely musical performances, so it would be very technically wrong for me to say I like their music better than their acting.  I need to borrow my friend's DVD and watch the actual show that everyone knows them for.

      The show is actually very good, it's British level comedy with an American length sitcom, although rumor is that they are ending it with the second season. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the entire show is based around the idea that the best songs they play are in their heads...i don't know it's hard to explain without watching it.

      It's his indomitable spirit that's the sentimental drivel. That's the whole premise of the thing. <br/>

I read the novella first though. It was OK, but the movie just ratcheted up the happy ending aspect to ludicrous levels.

      Well, it makes you, hopefully, conflicted. <br/>

You can like Lil' Wayne.  It just seems that people  who like today's hip-hop tend to scorn classic rock.  My two sisters and mother both hate the Beatles.  This is odd because I bet neither of my sisters can name more than 4 of their songs.  They don't care.

      yea same here, and i've read a lot of cerebral shit. my goal in life (or one of them) is basically to get famous making lowbrow surrealist paintings inspired by the simulation games with the Giant, the wolves, the tower, etc. that whole development really caught me off-guard and is the most fascinating part of the book for me. i don't know that any of that stuff would've been as meaningful to me if i'd read it when i was 14. i'm pretty sure not, i was an idiot bimbo then.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i think ender's game would make a really good anime. it has all the inter-character tension of an anime like berserk, except the tensions in ender's game are more novel in a way, and more human in another. in particular, the relationship between ender and his brother, and the relationship between his brother and his sister, {i}blew my mind{/i}.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i really hate it when people say something sucks, especially a book, but provide no explanation for why they feel that way. Onstad did that once with Ethan Frome, which i liked as well. but then again, i'm a sucker for recluses and tragic love stories. give literature a chance, people. goddamn.

      No. Ethan Frome was awful. Sledding into a tree is astoundingly stupid. It may be the stupidest suicide scheme I've ever heard of. Also they never once considered just running off together. Yes, it would be socially unacceptable, but so was everything else about their desired relationship. <br/>

      in response to your objections:  <br/> 
1. ethan and mattie did plan to run away together. ethan was hording money, but his wife found it. the sleigh incident came shortly after that, in despair. <br/> 
2. to simply say "why didn't they just run away together?" is to ignore all of the circumstantial and character development building up to the end. it is to ignore the fact that ethan is an honest man with a strong sense of obligation. i mean, what else could the man have done? he couldn't run away because he didn't have money. he couldn't kill his wife, though another character might have done just that. after the failed plan to run away, he was sort of jolted back into reality and realized that this is his life, he cannot escape it, and a relationship with mattie was not meant to be his in this lifetime because he'd already assumed responsibility for another (his marraige). sure, the sleigh suicide scheme was brash and poorly thought out, but it was precisely this childishness and urgency that i found so endearing about their love. it's romeo and juliet through and through, except instead of dying from the poison, romeo ends up retarded and disfigured, and instead of killing herself with a dagger, juliet has to live to take care of a retarded and disfigured romeo. christ, ethan frome is so much more brutal.  <br/>

 <br/> 
We already did something like this. It was the Cultural Reference Acceptability Index. Edwell made a nice chart. You should look for it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If we were talking about books, I'd say Vonnegut is probably someone almost everyone here could agree on. For movies, most people seem to like Cronenberg. For music, I don't know, probably some inoffensive indie rock. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, and I don't care much for the Beatles or any classic rock really. The people who go on about how much better music was in the 60's are generally lazy and clueless about the tons of more original and interesting shit that's come out since then. Also, it seems to me to be mainly a thing of old people and sandal-wearing fratboy douchebags.

      What if, like me, you like both a shitload of 60s stuff and a shitload of current independent music? (I call it that so that no one gives the usual stereotypical "indie" connotations, even though a lot of it is stylistically "indie") <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I've only seen a bit of Cronenberg's stuff and, not being a huge fan of horror, I don't like his movies very much.

      Must've missed that list. You'll forgive me for dismissing it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To continue, love Cronenberg, but I'm not sure he's right for the list. Maybe I'm wrong. Still haven't seen  <em>Eastern Promises.</em>  Maybe that's the one that everyone likes. It sure as shit ain't  <em>Naked Lunch.</em>  I mean, I watched that once a day for awhile, but it's just not the kind of thing everyone likes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Vonnegut's most famous book has already been shot down. I know that it's not his best, but it's probably the only one that almost everyone has read, and that's important. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You've got funny ideas about the Beatles, achilles. It's OK. I used to, too. I still think that judging a band by their fan base is a misguided policy, especially when one's ideas about said fan base are patently short-sighted. But that's  <em>cool.</em>  I guess my objection stems from the fact that there isn't a single contemporary band that everyone's gonna like, so why not choose the band who is directly responsible for what all decent modern indie pop sounds like? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I dunno. Maybe The Velvet Underground is a safer route?

      I know, I get bored and try to be as offensive and contrarian as possible even when my heart's not really in it. I don't actually  <em>hate</em>  the Beatles, I just always found them somewhat bland and inoffensive, and that sentiment is somewhat bolstered by the fact that everyone and their grandma likes them. Granted, some of their compositions were more complex and experimental than you can expect from a pop band, but at the end of the day they were just that.

      That was actually pretty good; I once saw a .gif of the guys drooling at the robot form of whatshername somewhere and it made me have a little more hope for the internet.  As far as silenties go, I love all manner of Charlie Chaplin, and  <em>Nosferatu</em>  successfully scared me.

      Stereo, I have a feeling that this reply is going to be about a mile away from your original comment, but hopefully you either have this assetbarista thing that all the kids are raving about or you check your inbox. <br/>

Anyway, if you haven't already seen Murnau's  <em>The Last Laugh,</em>  you're in for a treat. Not only isn't it a talkie, but it doesn't even use a single dialog card! That, and it's just a fucking amazing story. If you haven't seen it, see it. Now.

      I liked Lebowski well enough, but I am of the opinion that the Cohen Brothers can only play the 'the ultimate point is that there is ultimately no point' card so many times before people catch on. That said, I was not wowwed by 'No Country'.

 As an example, I did not like Lebowski at all. Don't argue with me. I admit it was brilliant silly, I just didn't like it. Give me Blood Simple or even Miller's Crossing. Definitely Raising Arizona.  <br/>

      It floors me that more people aren't familiar with  <em>Miller's Crossing.</em>  It seems like their lost masterpiece or something. Most people, even Coen fans, have never seen it till I make them see it. I think it's the best gangster film ever (though  <em>Goodfellas</em>  is always nipping at it's heels).

      I thought it was widely regarded as their best film and was certainly a highlight from the period (along with Barton Fink) when they started to attract wider critical praise, but hadn't yet had breakthrough mainstream success with Fargo. <br/>

Oddly Raising Arizona was pretty successful, but it never seemed to give them the success that Fargo did.

      I thought Coen fans after that held it in high regard. The only ones I thought that likely ignored it were the type who mainly got into The Big Lebowski once it came out on video and who might have maybe seen Fargo or Raising Arizona or only a few of their other films. <br/>

      Well, it's a matter of things that  <em>everyone</em>  might like. I love Tarantino, but it seems like his movies aren't likely candidates for universal love. Well, I guess I never met anyone who didn't like  <em>Reservoir Dogs,</em>  but it still seems iffy for this particular list. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Um, the only Hunter S. Thompson I ever read was  <em>The Rum Diary,</em>  so I would automatically be excluded if something of his was chosen. I really liked it, but I don't think it's considered to be one of his defining works. I need to read more. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Never read  <em>Fight Club</em>  either, but the movie seems like it could stand up to assetbar scrutiny.

      I always get accused of being a fool for not liking Tolkien.  Out of my many years of schooling, and the many occasions I had to read The Hobbit, I just couldn't bring myself to finish it.  Now, unfortunately, I've been rooked into taking a lit. course entirely devoted to Lord of the Rings and I might just snuff it.

Not epic literature by any means, but mildly amusing.  It's been a while since I read them, so I don't remember for sure if they had dialog, as in words in quote marks, but I think they did.

      It honestly seems that all he ever wanted to do was make up a bunch of fake languages and a new little world and write about it. He never seemed to be well-suited to writing stories set there and they never seemed to interest him as much as just writing about Middle Earth. <br/>

      Fig is the absolute worst flavor of Newtons. I've always preferred Apple. I find it odd that, given the name, Apple isn't the default. Strawberry is also good. I'd totally be down with a blueberry or such if it exists. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The fig is assy. <br/>

Damn. Now I want some delicious dates. I totally know this stall at the farmer's market that sells the best dates. I have a complete handle on that situation. <br/>

Issac Newton was a complete dick and there's credible evidence that most of his best discoveries are stolen or at least suspiciously discovered right around or just after others who didn't have his clout.

      I have read the books at least thirty times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I could not watch the movies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I actually got up and walked out of  <em>Fellowship</em>  when Gandalf fought Saruman in Saruman's own tower.  I mean, seriously.  What wizard is dim enough to fight another wizard  <em>in his own stronghold?????</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize this is a minority opinion, and I also realize this makes me a pathetic fanboy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And yes, yes, I know movies can't be the same as books.  For example, I expected Tom Bombadil to be left out.  But, really, was it necessary to make Gandalf into a fool? <br/>

      I liked the movies better, because they did not come with several hundreds of paragraghs describing how special was the food someone was eating, the ale someone was drinking, some jewlery someone was wearing or the ramparts someone was descending. <br/>

Christ in Hell, half of the first book consisted of the hobbits stopping and feasting.

      The other half concerned family politics and the preparations for Frodo to leave (which must have taken him nine damn months or so) and Gandalf returning every few years to talk about what he was learning about the ring.

      I was far too awed the first time around (saw all three on opening day) to pass any critical judgment, but when I went back and watched them again, I had to admit that Fellowship was kind of rushed and the dialogue felt kind of weak and forced. It straightened out after the Council of Elrond though. The parts with Boromir were well done, and then of course there was the battle with the Balrog. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I think that even if you hated everything else, the battle scenes in the second two movies alone would make them worthwhile.

      Those ghosts didn't come to Minas Tirith either, they just helped Aragorn seize the ships he needed to get there along with Gondorian slaves that had been on the ships and, IIRC, other rangers. That was so amazingly crazily stupid to have them flying around like it was Raiders of the Lost Ark. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh and since Merry got his damn sword from Aragorn rather than from the barrow it makes significantly less sense that it would even be by an amazing coincidence an enchanted weapon designed specifically to be used against the Witch-King of Angmar.

Huh?! Man, this is totally outta left field! I'm goin', "What?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Though cgi is normally what will keep me away from a movie, I can appreciate good cgi when I see it...and LotR had pretty damn good cgi, especially since it wasn't from Skywalker Ranch people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course the acting is gonna be a little cheesy: it's a fucking fantasy epic with elves and wizards!  It's the nature of the beast.  I thought the acting was quite good for the context, actually.  I'm not gonna agree with every choice made by the actors, but I expect a few disagreements on performance in about 9 hours of film.

      The books or the movies? The books had the sort of excessive over-description of the landscape that implied that he masturbated over Dickens and cared more about his damn world-building than telling a decent story. I have serious issues with LOTR and I'm a fantasy fan with a full bookcase just for role-playing books. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The movies started out good, but then started to diverge horribly in Two Towers and were just fucked to hell at many points of Return of the King. Yes, I am criticizing a film for not being accurate enough to a book I didn't really like that much. Except Tom Bombadil. Fuck him with a sack of flaming coals. I hate him like I hate Thomas Edison (the Bill Gates/Microsoft of the 19th Century and one of the two people in history I strongly want to cock-punch repeatedly until they pass out from blood loss).

      I can't wait for the movie, even though it's going to be different than the book, and the group is called The Watchmen and not The Minutemen because I think Zack Snyder (minus his Dawn of the Dead remake) has a lot of respect for the source media and will do a good job, but nerds need to understand that he also has to make a film that is marketable to the masses. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is pretty much the same reason I can't wait for the new Star Trek (although I am by no means a Trekkie, I only watch it every so often), however my girlfriend (tee hee) is a HUGE Trekkie and thinks it is going to suck.

      I will almost certainly see it.  But I hold a very low opinion of JJ Abrams.  So I won't expect it to be very good, making me much less likely to be truly disappointed. <br/>

I will probably see it in a theater when it goes to the dollar movie.  A film like that needs a big screen, but it is not worth that much money to me.

      You still have them for a dollar? Wow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Red Vic is a great smaller, worker-owned one-screen theater. While they show a lot of independent and rep films they also tend to show a lot of films second-run. The problem is that they're still charging like $8-9 a ticket and their screen and sound aren't up to it. By that point it's almost on DVD as well. I saw Zodiac there and the print was so scratched it was... well, very, very damaged. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The best I can immediately think of is the Parkway Theater over in Oakland which is one of those beer and pizza and a movie sort of places with couches and food and such. They've got a great older theater, a nice screen, and adequate sound (sounded more like decent stereo rather than surround, but still). They only charge $5 and Wed. is two-for-one night. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For me with a big-budget film of that nature picture and sound quality matter to me just as much as a large screen do. Dollar theaters often short you heavily on both.

      For the record, guitarhero, your mention of the new  <em>Star Trek</em>  movie was the first I heard of it (my friends and I are nerds, but not  <em>that</em>  kind). I looked around for info about it and saw that Simon Pegg is playing Scotty and that it's directed by the guy who created  <em>Lost.</em>  That's all I need to know. I will watch it.

      Watching the unrated DVDs days apart, I have to say that, while Planet Terror is incredibly paced it falls apart shortly after they get to the military base, and never comes back. If they left it as "some people trying to survive as the town goes to shit" it would have probably been Robert Rodriguez's greatest film (although I'm sure everyone would call it a rip off of From Dusk til Dawn). However, once they added the bullshit of some people being immune and the whole planet being infected and going to Mexico it kinda wasn't the same. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Death Proof was pretty much consistent throughout the film. Talking talking talking WHAM brutal death scene. Talking talking lots of talking WHAM car chase brutal death scene. I think if QT cut the first 15 minutes and just established that Jungle Julia and the gang were at the bar and Kurt Russell was being a creeper it would have been better, as it stands now I was glad that they got fucking destroyed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The set up to the final scene however, is a lot better on DVD than it is in the theaters, primarily because you didn't just have to sit through the fast paced action of Planet Terror.

      Yeah, I like Tarantino's dialogue and all; it's just that after the intensity of Planet I don't feel like staying up another two hours if all they are going to do is talk.  It wasn't bad, but after 45 minutes I stopped paying a lot of attention to it.

      You... <em>liked</em>  Tarantino's dialogue in Death Proof?   <br/>

I was pretty much rolling my eyes straight through the entire film.  It would seem that he doesn't understand that you can't just create realistic female discourse by replacing every instance of the word "pussy" with the word "dick". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I dig his male writing, for sure, it's hilarious.  When it is a group of thirty-something women, it is just completely without any base in reality.

      I don't think he was saying he liked the dialogue in Death Proof, just QT's dialogue in general. I may be wrong though. <br/>

I agree, the first half of the film was tedious up until Stuntman Mike pulls unsuspecting Rose McGowan from the bar, but the dialogue in the second half was, to me, actually well rounded. IDK again I may be wrong.

      I foresee a big UK OFFICE > US OFFICE and vice versa debate, but I'll ignore it.  Yes, I think it's something like that, with a bishop saying something to someone or other.  I have no idea, it's been a while for me too.  "That's what she said" has become such an integral part of my life since I began watching the US Office, so I like it for its dumbness, and maybe that's the point (because Michael is dumb lolz).

      Holy Cripes. <br/> 
They are good. <br/> 
See, this is why I started this discussion.  I'm not a huge Zeppelin fan myself, but I don't see how anyone think that they are bad.  Being capable is being good.  They are the same.  If you don't like a particular artist, but you still recognize he draws awesome landscapes, he is capable AND good.  He is good at drawing.  Led Zeppelin is good at playing and writing music.  If that is not your favorite genre, that's fine.  Just don't listen to them.  End of story.

      I can't imagine how long you'd have to be on here to post as often as you do. I find too many of your comments highly amusing to suggest you run away. Leaving would have nothing to do with you being Assetbar Pat. However, enough reassurance from me, I understand you feel like a depressive person, that doesn't mean we should bundle you in cotton wool. It only makes things worse.

      Several things: <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was 7 when  <em>I</em>  came out.  I had stopped toddling  <em>months </em> before that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Presence</em>  and  <em>In Through the Out Door</em>  were actually released while I was in high school.  But I didn't say "when they were released," I said "when they were new."  In the context of 30 to 40 years ago, a couple of years old is still "new." <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Coda</em>  was released while I was in college.  Since it was made from songs off the cutting room floor, most people I know don't really count it among the Led Zeppelin discography.  It's not a question of denying its place, it's more a question of choosing not to think about it at all.

      Ah, thank you for the explanation. <br/>

And my error was using the letter "I" as a Roman Numeral one, as in  <em>Led Zeppelin I</em> , in such a way as to make it seem like I was coming out of the closet. <br/>

If having people mistakenly think I am homosexual embarrassed me, I would be embarrassed.  As it is though, I find it ever-so-slightly amusing. <br/>

      Not like you didn't know this already, but... <br/> 
 <br/> 
When you get to the step where you subtract b^2 from both sides, you have zero equals zero.  So everything beyond that step is mostly irrelevant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But you did make me go through this and  parse it out.  I don't know how I have taught algebra for as long as I have, yet have never seen this. <br/>

I didn't think it was actually something that happened, I felt compelled to find the fallacy in it. <br/>

      Stephen King?  I agree.  Well, I read maybe 10 of his books?  I'm not sure.  He's pretty good.  It and The Stand are my two favorite books. <br/>

      Ooooohhhhhh, the moon one. I read them all about 15 years ago. Really. 15 years. Oh fuck I feel old. How Dean Koontz's career has lasted this long is... well, not suprising considering garbage sells. Who the fuck describes a house in architectural terms as part of a smooth narrative. Faaark.

      Has anyone seen the Lifetime movie where a woman has an abusive husband or is being stalked and she has to defend herself (with the help of some close girlfriends or sisters of course) and it culminates with a big court case where she either sends the rapist to prison or gets custody of the kids?  Also she either lives in Middle America or somewhere like Oregon, Alaska or Maine.  And it has a bad title like "A Stranger Outside" or "A Mother's Love" or something.  That's my favorite one.

      This is because Ray is already paired up with his insufferable ego for life. <br/> 
 He sees a Ladycat as a necessary accessory to fill a seat, but in the end he allows no opening to his heart, so they do not like him. Surely you know boys who are like this- So it is with Ray. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 He may have been an only kitten, but he has never truly loved. Who knows why he is so self-absorbed? <br/> 
 Only an emotional crash the equivalent of the Hindenburg could break that heart of stone.

      I thought I read this in Senior English, but I'm not sure.  I remember a poem about two crows or ravens, talking, over a dead knight.  What poem am I thinking of?  It is a very old one, of course.  Medieval, or Middle English.

      We read that one in Scottish Lit with the lecherous professor. It's called Twa Corbies: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>As I was walking all alane,<br/>
I heard twa corbies makin a mane;<br/>

"Whar sall we gang and dine the-day?"<br/>
<br/>
"In ahint yon auld fail dyke,<br/>
I wot there lies a new slain knight;<br/>
And nane do ken that he lies there,<br/>

"His hound is tae the huntin gane,<br/>
His hawk tae fetch the wild-fowl hame,<br/>
His lady's tain anither mate,<br/>

"Ye'll sit on his white hause-bane,<br/>
And I'll pike oot his bonny blue een;<br/>

 <br/> 
It's the Scottish variant of the same poem. Apparently the English version has been interpreted so that the pregnant doe is actually the knight's lover in animal form, who sacrifices herself to bury him. But this version cynically shows what would really happen, which is that she found another dude.

      One time I went to the Boston Aquarium, which has a fairly large penguin habitat on the bottom level. As I was leaving, I noticed that there was a man leaning over the cement penguin enclosure and making penguin calls. After a while, some of the penguins were responding to him with their strange warble, and I wondered: Was this man merely imitating them or had he planned, learning their mystic language on his own. And if so... <br/> 
What the fuck?

      I have never looked at anyone else's profile, other than out of curiosity about how many chubbies and lames they have accumulated. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, based on that, there is not much of anything I am curious about. <br/>

I have filled in some of the things in my own profile, but I doubt anyone has ever looked at them. <br/>

Certainly, no one has ever referred to them that I am aware of.

      Damn, you've got me beat - I've made about $180 in royalties as a songwriter.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suppose I can take some pride in the tens of thousands of dollars I've made as a performing musician (over 25 years, mind you, including about 18 months actually making an extremely meager full-time living at it), but that's not where my ambitions lay, so it doesn't count.  <br/>

On the other hand, I picked up many many more women as a musician than as an ordinary nerd, by a ratio of 5 to 0.

      This strip gets a 5 because of Ray's lines in that last panel. <br/> 
It has been a long while since i've read a line that is so PERFECT to the dude mindset. "Just stay home, dude. I'll brief you later." I have said this and been told this (or a variance thereof) far too many times to count.

      This is off-topic but related in a way.  One night, laying in bed, half asleep, drifting in and out of consciousness, a sharp thought pierced the fog of my tired mind: "Larry Bird is like the Michael Jordan of basketball."  The absurdity woke me up and made me laugh, and all subsequent attempts to recapture the glory never succeeded: "Dale Earnhardt is the Jeff Gordon of racing"; "Sandy Koufax is the Whitey Ford of baseball;" etc. <br/>

      No jacket, but it seems he's put on a watch for the occasion. As soon as I saw it, I thought, oh, Ray's going to look at his watch. Like on The Simpsons, when Homer's wearing a watch, and you know he's going to look at it because otherwise why would they go to the trouble of drawing it? But Ray doesn't look at his watch.

      I do too.  Not to say I'm all down on character development and love the "gag-a-day" form, but Achewood really rides high when a stand alone strip has Ray and Beef going back and forth about parking, or Lie-Bot telling Phillipe about the skeleton in the closet, or Ray talking about his hemorrhoid, because they're still character-derived and not just cheap jokes.  Does that makes sense at all?  It does.

      That actually makes perfect sense. I agree as well, I like character development but I also like to laugh. I think Onstad has proven that he can have both (The Party, for example) but lately he has been sacrificing humor for plot, or dragging things out to one excruciatingly set-up punch line (I think the fact that they keep calling Polly a gold digger is a hint at where this arc is going). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would say the best recent example of what Onstad needs to be doing is the Wedding arc. The build up to the actual wedding and the aftermath was perfect and I waited every day for the next strip. The three arcs that built up to it, however, were an example of what he needs to not do in the future. <br/>

      From the 'Fellowship of the Ring' movie, where Viggo offers his sword, elf-boy his bow and Gimli his axe. The scene was unintentionally funny, and therefore rendered unfunny by use of the internet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Though I have never seen it done properly, the premise of it would probably be that in casual conversation, one person says something along the lines of 'you have my____', you would add the 'My axe' rejoinder. <br/> <br/> <br/> Example:  <br/> 
Party 1:"I was speaking to my sister the other day. She... Well, she had been drinking throughout the pregnancy. She lost the child." <br/> 
Party 2 "Oh my god. I'm so sorry. You have my sympathy." <br/>

      I was working overseas once, and I started seeing a local woman.  This was in a country where the average income was about $8 a month.  We were having dinner at the house of a friend of mine who was also an ex-pat.  We actually met at his house in the first place.  Out of the blue, he pulled out a bunch of $100 bills and asked me to tell him if I thought they were genuine or counterfeit.  I was uncomfortable, my girlfriend was upset, this guy was just smug.  I went into the next room to ask him what the hell he was doing, and he said he thought I should be careful, she was probably just after my money.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Better yet, the next month he said he wanted to buy my laptop.  He kept it for six months, didn't pay me, and then said he didn't want it because he could get a better one.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Somehow, he still thought he was my friend after all this.  Kept sending me e-mails after he left the country and so on.  Ray lives, I guess.

      He said he'd pay me after he went back to France to get cash.  This was actually normal practice; we all had to carry in any cash we needed, as the banks could not be trusted.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, he bought himself a better computer when he was in France and simply returned mine, long after I had replaced it.  He was the one who effectively took my money, but this irony escaped him.

Well, Monroe does put a lot of time into some of them.  He is a good drawer, I think.  HE just doesn't utilize his ability. <br/>

No, I understand what you're saying to an extent. I guess I should have taken a pot shot at the dialog, then. Whether or not it's clever (or just "smart," whatever that avails it), every "character" is clearly speaking in the same voice which is the undisguised voice of the author. I mean, you put Connie, Beef and Vald in a dark room, you know who's who. On the other hand, you put the stick figure with the hat in a dark room with the, um....the stick figure  <em>without</em>  the hat.... <em>yeah.</em>   <br/>

I think my point stands. You think I am wrong. That's OK.

      Nah, I don't think you're wrong. I was just pointing out that most of the drawing in Achewood is basically clip art at this point, so it's a bad place to hang your hat when explaining why the strips take so long. This second explanation of yours is better.

also, anyone else noticed that you can't get to assetbar by clicking on the comic, any more?  the way I got here, this time around, is by searching achewood assetbar.  it came up, my profile is still here, everything is, but is it possible it's not accessible any more from the ordinary achewood site? <br/>

that seems strange, to me.
