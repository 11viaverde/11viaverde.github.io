      Interestingly enough, Eskimos only have about four words for snow. One thing that they have a lot of are - I think - demonstrative pronouns. Like, we have just "this" and "that," like "this one here" and "that guy up there."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
They have single words for all of those. I believe there's around thirty of them. Odd, isn't it?

      I am Irish. I have never heard the name Cudahy. It does resemble an Irish name, although perhaps the spelling is so changed I do not recognise it, as happens to many Irish names brought over. <br/>

The other possibility is that it's Scottish (very similar etymology) or that the entire Cudahy clan emmigrated/died in the famine. This is common enough.

      Having spent the entire storyline in suspense over whether Ray actually liked Dornheim, I am pleased to see that the answer is yes. Ever since  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145447/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=09112003">Mark Twain</a>  I've had the darnedest time telling when Ray genuinely likes a dude.

      Well, assuming that we won't be seeing Dornheim for a little while at least, I've got to say that except for the  <em>very</em>  classy leave, here, I found him fairly boring. S'cool that Ray got to reminisce about his father with blood, though. <br/>

Dornheim and this mini-arc got threed, but that was a solid fiveful leaving (along with the truly slackful double-gulp at the end), so I'll split the difference.

      I must admit that, since I didn't like Dornheim, with his pen liner and his aviators and his beardy little teeth, I wanted him to leave, which he did, with a rudeness that bordered on grace, which means I now like him better, but do I want him back? I'm confused.

      Ray's leave is inherently better. It comes naturally. Dornheim may have one-upped him but he is certainly trying too hard. <br/>

      lateadopter, if you read this, I'd like to retract my arguments from yesterday.  After today's strip, I went back and re-read the last few, and you're right.  Dornheim's ridiculous turns of phrase are not akin to Beef's tone.  I thought we'd get more information about Dornheim, and this would make him a more believable character.  Instead, he's gone, and I just feel confused.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It seemed like every new piece of background on Dornheim was surprising, but not in a particularly good way.  I didn't think "his whiskey sours are  <em>famous</em> ? That rocks!"  It was more of a "why does this guy feel the need to brag about his whiskey sours?"  And that feeling occurred in response to just about every single thing that Dornheim said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In conclusion, I didn't really enjoy this mini-arc.  But if Onstad's goal was to leave me bewildered and a little irritated, that's cool.  Just so long as there's a good explanation later on.

      I think it shows more sass, as if to say, "I honestly believe you'll be stupid enough to believe I've called you a cab, so I'm going to spell it out because it would just get pitiful after a while, watching you standing there, waiting for a cab." <br/>

      What i get out of this strip is two cats wanting to connect with their father in the worst way. Ray, upon finding out that Ramsies won the GOF, not only won the fight himself, but changed the game entirely. Dornheim's only experience with his father is Ramsies silently walking out on him in a liquor store. He took that experience and turned walking out on people into an artform. I may be way off but this may be one of the saddest situations in this strip so far, safe Beef of course.

      I also think Dornheim was jealous that Ramses knew who Ray was and not him. I think this is a motivation for Dornheim to find Ray and leave with a pre-typed letter sitting on the table. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ramses was a smart dude in a way; both his sons turned out great at what they do as a direct result of his absentee parenting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The more I think about this, the more I worry about Onstad.

      The main problem here is that Ray and Dorheim are both fucking hopeless. The kind of men who are so emotionally retarded by their upbringing that this type of "I really wanted to find out who you are" but now must disappear like my dad, is just the worse kind of perpetuation of their own treatment.
