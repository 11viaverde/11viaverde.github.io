      Have you watched that trend? I read the wordy strips, but this is one of my least favorite (my favorites being the one in which Harry Potter makes too much money, and the ballad of Rushmouth). Perhaps the wordier strips just open up more areas in which tastes diverge...

The video I linked to is from the film 1900 and features Donald Sutherland declaring a cat as the symbol of the temptations of communism and the manipulative nature of their propaganda. He then head butts the cat.

      Actually, that is the least horrible thing he could do to the cat!  Cats, being hunters that depend on short, accelerated bursts of speed to catch their prey are built like Mac trucks in the skull department.  They've evolved to take head-on collisions, their skulls and spinal cords absorb the impact.  The Tom and Jerry cartoons of Tom running full force into the wall when Jerry makes it to the mousehole aren't far off.

      Given the international theme of this comic, I feel it's appropriate to discuss this here. I was looking up the size of A4 paper in millimetres, and Wikipedia tells me this: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"There have been many standard sizes of paper at different times and in different countries, but today there are two widespread systems in use: the international standard (A4 and its siblings) and the North American sizes." <br/> 
 <br/> 
What the  <em>HELL</em> , USA. Why, exactly, is it necessary for you to have different paper-sizing than the rest of the world? International standard not good enough for you?  <em>Jeez.</em> <br/>

      I dunno A4 paper is a hella weird size. If it is the size I am thinking of, which is the size that's a bit longer than 8.5x11 and the printer at work won't detect, it is clearly an American made machine.

      I have heard from many non-Americans that root beer tastes like absolute shit.  A dude from India said it smelled like a medical ointment, and not fit to consume  <em>at all</em> .  A professor I had (from Spain) also made a comment to the same effect.  I think that being conditioned to its flavor from a young age convinces the American palate of its palatability.   <br/>

Either that or the rest of the world is just  <strong>SCREWY</strong> .
