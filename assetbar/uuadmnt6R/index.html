      Sadly breasts have about the same rate of success with popping out as those crappy little nubs that don't pop half the time. Some ladies just don't really nip very much and some others just can't keep the damn things down. This is a shame. There ought to be a program to teach ladies how to nip harder and more frequently.

      I was going to say;  <br/> 
"That you are gay or female but probably not both?" <br/> 
But I decided it would be disingenuous, <br/> 
as I do not find those breasts especially intriguing myself. <br/> 
Perhaps if they had a face of a woman above them <br/> 
with an expression that was all, like, <br/> 
"Look at my breasts," <br/> 
I would be more intrigued. <br/> 
Anonytits are not my cup of tea.

      Idiocy and corporate excess have always proven remarkably resilient. Almost as much as upper-management salaries. It doesn't matter if they have to lay off almost everyone else the guys at the top aren't going to take a cut in their lifestyle just because of the economy. If it's a matter of your job whether the CEO is spending $4,000 or only 3,000 on dinner I'd start updating your resume.

      Fived for the homeopathic foot powder in panel 1. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For those who don't know, homeopathy is basically the practice of watering down medicines to make them more effective, to the point where not a single molecule of the actual thing that can cure you is left and you're literally just drinking a glass of water. If it worked, all water would still have the qualities of dinosaur piss, or at least the piss of billions of fish in the ocean. It violates the entire established knowledge of chemistry. <br/>
