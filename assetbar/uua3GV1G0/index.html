      Close, but not quite. Much of current San Francisco wasn't settled or was regarded as unlivable at the time (it is not livable now either despite the unfortunates who live there) and Palo Alto is far enough away as to not even exist. Even now most people never bother to go there unless they have pressing business.

      No, people lived in San Francisco, but only a small portion of the city today. Roughly only the downtown quarter of the city. The western side of town was all sand dunes (known as the Outside Lands at the time) and the southern part of town was farmland or otherwise sparsely developed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Today the west side of town is roughly nothing but rows upon rows of identically ugly residential streets with basically little reason to go out there and the southern part of town is more or less ignored as even existing and if you don't live there there is absolutely no reason to ever go there. Nobody ever discusses much of anything outside of the northeastern quadrant of town with few exceptions. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Palo Alto would have been unfathomably far away. Frankly, I can barely even fathom going anywhere near there myself and I live at the extreme southwestern edge of town.

      Then to this I shall also add a history lesson. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By 1870 Mark Twain was living in New York. When he wrote  <em>Huckleberry Finn</em> , as well as most of his more well-known works, he was living in Hartford, Connecticut. While often associated with San Francisco he only lived here for a relatively short period of time, but did make a name for himself here before leaving for the East Coast.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As well while  <em>Finn</em>  was published in 1884  <em>Life on the Mississippi</em>  was published the prior year in 1883 making it slightly more likely that he would have been working on it at the time. Even more accurately, he'd been working on the manuscript for  <em>Finn</em>  on and off from 1876 to 1883 so he would not have been referring to it in such a manner as in strip, where he appears to be beginning work on the story. Still, it does mean he could indeed have been writing it at the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But him being in Connecticut means that they must also have traveled in space and the entire previous discussion is irrelevant.

      It's just nice to have a niche. <br/>

If pedantry isn't considered a virtue on Assetbar then we're doing something wrong. <br/>
