      Daedala_x, you wrote: <br/> 
 <br/> 
" <em>potential protracted colon</em> " <br/> 
 <br/> 
The greater risked is of  <em>prolapsed </em> colon.  In this condition the organ grows tired of its normal confines, and wants to go exploring the world on its own.  Depending on the severity of the prolapse, it might even find new friends and start a new life.

      Would they not accept goatse.cx? Let's face it, that's the proper image for a credit card. We all know it. It works on so many levels (mainly just two though). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ah well, due to never having a credit card I'm deemed not responsible enough to have a credit card. I wouldn't want one either, but landlords are always wanting a credit check and apparently "I pay my bills on time every month in cash and have references for the past eight years or so that will attest to this and how I'm a great tenant" isn't quite the same for some reason. Nice to know that incurring debt is judged as more responsible than sensibly avoiding it altogether.

      Yeah, my girlfriend got a secured card after giving them some sort of down payment. She's just running our rotating, fixed monthly expenses on it (cable, Netflix, etc.) and leaving them on auto-pay and then using auto-pay on her debit card to pay off the credit card. It's basically just adding an extra, unwanted layer in there, but it should be building credit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Aside from some secured thing or something equally pain in the ass since I have absolutely no credit history nobody will even give me a card. I always find it interesting all these articles and such about how many cards Americans have an how easy it is when the only credit offer I've ever been approved on was when the lady at the taqueria gave me a dollar off because she was low on change.

      Most people are bombarded with credit card offers as soon as they step into their college dorm. A lot of colleges even 'partner' with credit card companies, which basically means that they give them your dorm phone number so they can call you at all hours of the day or assault you around campus. We are further told by the experts that we should take advantage of these offers because it is a good time to start building credit.

You get a credit card, buy things regularly, and you pay off like 90% for each bill.  And you do this for a few months.  And then you get a second credit card and you "play them off eachother" until they offer you platinum. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is the advice my father gave me before he went out for cigarettes and never came back.

      Why wouldn't you pay 100% of it every month? Why incur interest? <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is fundamentally why I don't get it. Why on Earth would I ever want to borrow money from someone and then have to owe them more money as a result? I mean, I can sort of see the idea if you're buying a house or a car or such (I'd rather just save up until I could afford it or rent, but apparently people decided long ago to make this idea appear crazy to most people), but for everyday purchases what's the point? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can maybe see the point of using a credit card in the days before debit cards were common as a convenience and then paying it off every month. Not ideal, but it was basically the only option. But going into debt over random crap? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Speaking of platinum at my old bank after my first debit card expired they sent me a platinum debit card. What in the hell is the point of that? I can now spend more of the money I already have? It looks shinier? So crazy.

      Supposedly it is because the credit card companies will like it if you don't pay it all off as soon as you get the bill.  I'm sure thye do like it better.  But does that necessarily mean better credit?  My father thinks it does.  HE told me that when he owned his business he could take out a million dollars in credit.   <br/> 
I am definitely not a credit guy.  I hate using the thing, because of the interest.  You don't know how angry I was when I found out I was two bills behind because my mom didn't give me my bills when I was at college.  I had to pay a lot of interest.   <br/> 
The reason why I use my credt card is so, basically, I can get a loan when it comes to important stuff.  I am in college, and I like being in college, and I want to spend a long time in academia.  I couldn't get any loans last year to pay for school because I had no credit, and my parents have terrible credit (my father reuined the good credit he got).   That is why I am forcing my self to use this card when I have 7000 dollars in the bank, have a $300 monthly income, and I spend $100 a month.

      $100 a month? You're kidding, right? Dude, just my fucking rail tickets cost me $23.50 a week. And that's student prices, regular folks pay $47. If I want to have lunch, it's what, $7 for a Subway meal? Or maybe $8 for the sushi place across the road. (Small college). I still live at home but occasionally get groceries for the week, and that's usually $100-$150. For a  <em>week</em> . How - how is what you're saying possible? You're in college, staying presumably on campus, but you still have to eat for chrissake.

      I've done the math several times, and I still don't see how someone can live on $100 a month.  Well, I suppose you could  <em>survive</em> , but it's seriously not healthy.  The half-life of caffeine is under 12 hours in most people, so you'll need to have coffee at least twice per day.  An adequately sized latte or caffe mocha costs four dollars and change, and you'll want to give the barista a tip so the other patrons don't all look up from their iPhones and glare at you for being so cheap, so let's call it an even five dollars.  That works out to $300 per month just for the essentials.

      energy drinks are cheaper and can be bought in bulk. no glaring. not even a fake-smile customer-service cherubs asking if you want to donate a dollar to the cause of the week, 'cos the person ringing you up will go into the back room and shoot themselves on their next state-required ten-minute break. <br/>

that and the ramen and c-brand cereals can tide everyone over on $100. i'm soon to go off to college in the next few weeks. i will prove these statements.

      I don't drink coffee, or red bull, or anything like that.  And if I wanted to, my cafetaria--which, as I already said, is paid for for the year and I can go as many times I want and get as much as I want--has a good selection of coffee.

Now you're just being silly.  Tea bags and instant coffee are sold at the  <em>grocery store</em> .  The grocery store is a veritable  <strong>wasteland</strong> .  They don't sell CDs or even books at the grocery store.  So even if you can buy your caffeinated beverages there, your life will be culturally barren. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the coffee shop supports  <strong>fair trade</strong> .  I didn't have time to read that brochure because I had to catch up on some important cellphone calls while waiting in line for my coffee, but the bottom line is that fair trade is  <strong>really important</strong> .  Does your  <em>grocery store</em>  have brochures about fair trade?  I didn't think so.  Every time you shop there, you're oppressing indigent people.  No, wait.  Indigenous.  Indignant?  I can't remember the exact term, but I learned all about it from the liner notes of the new Sting CD I bought at the coffee shop. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, I know: igneous!  You're oppressing the igneous people.  Come on!  There's a freaking  <strong>volcano</strong>  in the middle of their village.  Don't you think they've suffered enough?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The coffee shop coffee also protects the rainforest.  Does your grocery store coffee come with a brochure explaining its environmental impact?  No, I didn't think so. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, and trade in that bicycle of yours for a Prius, before it's too late.  We've got an  <strong>environment</strong>  to save!

      Yeah, but I wasn't an idiot willing to sink himself into debt for absolutely no reason. I had a debit card which I prefer, (it's the same level of convenience, but I'm only spending the money I actually have)I didn't have any income, and know it's just complete crap. Turns out that the responsible choice is the problematic one when you live in an irresponsible society. <br/>

It was like 2 days before I knew this, and I made a series of very small purchases (like $2, $4, nothing above 10). Then the bank charged me $35 for each one of those. With a credit card, I'll still pay it off each month, but no jackass overdraft fees. Plus, you know, building credit and all that jazz.

      I got my first cards a couple of years ago when I got a real job. Spent about $20 on one every month (I liked the picture more), never really used the other. I mean a 20% interest rate doesn't really inspire me to max the thing out every single month. Bought a brand new car, made my credit soar. Paid them off in full every time.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In September of this year, I got an AmEx with a huge line of credit and a 5% interest rate.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I completely agree with the "I don't understand why you don't pay it off in full" every month mindset, but I'm starting to see why people get into debt. I've been putting more and more on one card every month (I'm up to $300 already this billing period, from my average of $100). I'm building a new PC and I'm tempted to just throw EVERYTHING on the card and then just pay $50 a month off. ARGH IT IS SO TEMPTING.

      I can see how people might think that. That they can just go on paying off a little bit forever. I still look at it and realize that I'll be paying more long-term in exchange for thinking that I'll be paying less. Also I realize that one day the reckoning will come.

      Legal spouses inherit estates, which include assets and debts, even in absence of a will.  If there is no spouse, and an estate has sufficient assets, debts must be paid out by the executor while the will is in probate.  If there are insufficient assets to cover outstanding debts, the estate can be declared bankrupt.  I don't know enough about the recent tightening of the screws that was called 'bankruptcy reform' to know for sure, but it may now be easier to be declared bankrupt after you are dead than while you are alive.

 The son, who was our H.S. Senior class President, was also in charge of our 20th H.S. reunion. Also, he inherited his dad's debt, which turned out to be prodigious. Both were, not coincidentally, lawyers.  <br/> 
 My friend got into pushing powder to try to make up the deficit, got busted a few weeks before reunion, and now can you guess the rest?

Also Daedala, I will point out further silliness about your credit card thing above.  Seriously, never worry abou the first four digits, those just say what make of card you have.  They are usually the same.  Always blank the rest, and blank the expiry.  I know a few places that will take the card without asking ofr the little numbers on the back, and could get a lot of naked animals delivered at my place really fast.  You oughtta take that one down pretty quickly if you still have access

      while it would delight me to no end to receive a lot of naked animals, perhaps you are right. i was actually going to blank the rest, but didn't for the sake of the photo. how silly/naive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
since you seem to know a lot about this, and since i seem to know very little, let me ask you:  <br/> 
 <br/> 
how does most credit card fraud happen? it seems that online, for everything you'd want to buy with a cc, you'd also have to enter in your billing address and the 3-digit security code. so even if someone made a pressing of your card numbers at a restaurant, they still wouldn't have your address. and in person, you would have to present the actual card. right?

      Usually we go about stealing CCs using phishing techniques.  All those fake emails telling you that you won something or that there is something wrong with your bank account or some such.  You follow the link to a fake site that looks legit, then enter your info, and bam.  Two days later you are cleaned out by some Russian with a penchant for veggie-based porno.

      The man has every right to ask for money in order to see the strips.  He has every right to take down all of the strips from the free section and post them on the paid section.  For a man who has to support himself, his wife, and his child, I am surprised he posts as many free ones as he does.  Maybe the man doesn't want advertising.  I hate advertising.  Maybe he does too.  And maybe the man is struggling too?  I don't know what exactly his income is, but there i sonly a handful of comic writers who are able to support themselves, and Achewood only has like one quarter of the traffic xkcd does.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am confused as to why you are protesting to an update to the paid side when you yourself buy all the books.  Aren't the books 90% free material?  For someone who doesn't like to pay money for things you could get for free, you sure spend a lot of money for things you can get for free. <br/> 
Perhaps he also feels bad for those who pay for the extra content because he feels like they don't get enough?  Have you thought of that? <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I'm saying is don't swear at the man who is only trying to support a family, and provided you with over a thousand free strips.

      While I agree, I still think he could have been a bit more honest with how he promoted the new strip, or even just gone ahead and posted both here. I mean, you don't pay per strip for the premium site and, like has been said, no one is going to turn down FREE content, especially if it was advertised. <br/>

      If an image of a lady who has - and this bit is unrelated by and large - had her clitoris and inner labia surgically removed having a gleaming metal meat hook (for lack of a better word) inserted into her vagina and out of her perineum (I, as well as others, had initially believed it to be coming out of the anus, but despite this causing a very nasty fistula it was later shown by those with the stomach to make a close inspection to not be the case) then I shall certainly go and try to track it down again and then post a link to it for you. <br/>

Now, as for the wedding ring, my plan is to just have my partner cut off their ringfinger and give it to me; that way, I can be assured they'll never be another's.  I mean,  <em>duh</em>  guy, fuck the ring!

      Oddly on topic wedding band tattoos actually make a certain degree of sense to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the same time I'm fundamentally anti-marriage (and vehemently against the gub'mint being involved in marriage) and I definitely don't view it as at all permanent. I've been told that my idea of "Well, if you don't like it you can always get divorced" means I just don't "get" marriage. I'd agree with that. As far as I'm concerned we've been together for eight years, we've been living together for five, some ceremony and a legal contract aren't going to make any real difference in any way that actually matters.

      While I would never,  <strong>ever</strong>  support someone doing that (although if they want to do something stupid to themselves it's their choice) I have to say it does look kind of nice. Very smooth and sleek. I think this is a case where disturbingly my aesthetic preferences for sleek, harsh, minimalist modern design (nothing extraneous, nothing that isn't a right angle or a flat plane, black or very dark stain exclusively) is interfering with my preferences regarding crotches. <br/>

I've heard that the removal of excess labia skin is a popular new surgical cosmetic procedure, but did she go beyond that? Also, do you know for a fact that her clitoris is removed or are you just inferring it from the photo? Is it possible that it's just hard to see? <br/>

      She has had a lot of things removed, and while a lot of it was ancillary meat, I'm definitely not seeing the remnants of a clitoris anywhere.  If it is there, well, then it must've been a cosmetic move on her part, and not some weird, ritualistic s&m thing.  It's just a vacuous hole, like a sex doll.  Sort of disturbing, but a reasonable enough facsimile of a human vagina that I can see how someone would want to put their genitals in it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pretty much though, anytime you can see  <em>inside</em>  of a person, it is terrifying.  I don't want to look at your insides.  You hear me, goatse!  You hear me, crochet!  I can visualize the pink viscera that is all up ins, I don't need to see it!

      Seriously people. I described it for you in advance. You knew what you were getting yourselves into. This was judged freaky by one of the main catalogers and creators of perversity on the Internet. This is a man who wrote a (great) novel with a scene where dudes are watching home edited Godzilla bukkake films while in some cases being pleasured with big reptilian-style gloves and even he thought it was wrong. <br/>

This is the Internet. If you can't find it here it probably doesn't exist... and since the Internet is filled with tons of things that don't exist it must like, super not exist or something.

      Since it's successfully far enough away from the links that I shouldn't taint everything when I went back and fixed the links I changed it slightly. See how the first link goes to a different place than the second which was the URL I initially posted? The first link is something very pleasant. It was a joke after giving such a horrible, yet accurate description. The second link is to the awfulness. Both to provide what was requested and perhaps maybe someone lets their guard down and thinks it's all a big joke and decides that since I lied about a link once maybe the whole thing was fake. It was not.

      I told you to trust me on that one. This is the proper way: describe in detail something horrible that you will not want to see and provide you with something adorable. If you were brave enough to click it anyway you are surprised and relieved. If you went in wanting perversion you will be sorely disappointed. It's also the unicorn chaser to having read that or if you went on and saw the image. Or if you just want a palate cleanser after reading and before viewing. <br/>

Also, it is not puppies. One is a kitten.

      It's a reference to a Tom Goes to the Mayor episode.  And yes, it's about bronzing/debronzing; in the episode, there's two instructional film strips (one covering each process), and on both the narrator has an odd pronunciation of bronzing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, if you ask me, he says it more like "brunzing", and not "brinzing."

If you've got an equation where x is squared, <br/> 
And you need to find the answer, need to be prepared, <br/> 
Gonna show you a way that's automatic, <br/> 
You just use the formula that's called the Quadratic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now the first thing you do you wanna be a solvin' hero, <br/> 
Is you take the whole equation, set it equal to ze-ro, <br/> 
And then you take your terms, get 'em set up tight, <br/> 
With x squared on the left, and the constant on the right, <br/> 
And then you take your numbers, there's gonna be three, <br/> 
And you call 'em the a, the b, and the c. <br/> 
And it's minus b, plus or minus the, <br/> 
Square root of b squared minus 4 a c. <br/> 
And then you take your fraction bar, you take it all the way, <br/> 
And underneath, you put 2 a*. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then they would be all, "Word." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or maybe, "Number." <br/>

      Wales is, surprisingly, the answer to both. <br/>

Overall it's a scary place where they decided that 'y' was doing such a great job at being a part-time vowel that they promoted it to full-time and, due in part to his recommendation, brought on 'w' as well.

      I don't think she's making that particular transition yet. I was just trying to think of the proper occupation to put "this kinda average-looking girl that I might see occasionally" in without just it being some girl you pass in the street without paying any attention to. There was a girl I saw on the BART platform the other day rocking an awesome coat that I remember more than I would have ever remembered her as she looks in that picture. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's also degrees. There's the professional-looking late-twenties/early-thirties kind of hot librarian look, but I was specifically thinking that she doesn't compare to the cute early-20s maybe still in college art school/lit major alt. kinda girl. Halfway through writing it initially I was reminded of a friend of mine who majored in art or literature or both and who worked at the library one summer and was pretty cute. Nothing ever happened there or probably ever would have, but somehow I remembered her of all people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Back in '00 we were both home from our respective colleges and went out to see a movie together. I had been at a party that I hadn't known was even happening before heading over when a girl I'd been interested in before college and had more or less forgotten about showed up. After the movie I came back to the party and as a result we started dating. We're still together.

      Oh I'm sorry but BALLS man.  Talk about pretentious.  I can't stand 99% of that album.  It's based on like 4 singles and the rest is shitty filler.  Honestly.  And its most diehard defenders are 14 year old stoners.  I enjoy Dark  Side every once in a while but The Wall makes me gag.

      I did enjoy Dark Side of the Moon more than The Wall.. but Dark Side hit me at a very impressionable age.  Both are awesome albums.  Anyone who didn't have a Pink Floyd musical period is not a full person, methinks.

      Look, I am not saying you have to like it.  I am not saying you are wrong for not liking it.  But to say that  <em>The Wall</em>  is nothing other than "4 singles and the rest is shitty filler" just shows that you didn't understand what it was about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It  <em>tells a story</em> .  All of it.  Every song. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am sure most movies could be reduce to four five-minute-long action scenes.  But the "shitty filler"  adds depth and breadth to the story told by those four scenes. <br/>

Again, not saying you have to like it.  But if you were to look at  <em>the whole album</em>  as a story, maybe you would form a different opinion.

      I know it's a story, I just think the music and lyrics of the rest of the album were not quality.  I get the whole "OHH I BUILT A WALL AROUND MYSELF" thing, don't insult me.  Everyone understands that aspect, I hope.  But I don't like it because I don't think most of the songs are good.  So that makes it an opinion.

It was probably going to that big protest against Prop 8 (the amendment banning same-sex marriage in California that recently passed by a narrow margin) last night. I should have known that standing up for gay rights would be enough to make me gay as well. <br/>

"In the United States, the word pissant can refer to any small ant that infests a home. <br/>

Also in the United States, pissant is an epithet for an inconsequential, irrelevant, or worthless person, especially one who is irritating or contemptible out of proportion to his or her significance." <br/>

I have made the maxim of my actions that Kant is both a complete idiot and a total douche. I certainly hope that this is adopted as a universal law. <br/>

      Well, the classical rebuttal to the categorical imperative is that you would not be allowed to lie in order to shelter a person from someone who intends to murder them. The conventional view is that such an action is acceptable as though it violates the general principal against lying it is done with both good intentions and with the focus being to save someone's life which is generally agreed to be a higher moral necessity that outweighs the lie. Kant, however, would have us believe that lying at all, even in justified circumstances such as that, is not acceptable because of his rigid, absolutist standard. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I may not be in the field myself, but I'm certain that either of us could find plenty of valid citations that would make the same point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Further I'll state that philosophy, more than almost any other field, is one for everyone. Though it may not be my field of study I'm still using it and my opinions on moral issues are valid as I will continue to make moral decisions.

      I'm confused about that.  I was discussing this same thing with a very intelligent philosopher dude, and he said that it would be okay to lie in that instance, while still following the Categorical Imperative.  The murder of the woman would be a consequence, sure, but a logical consequence, not the other type.  I'm paraphrasing badly here.  I still don't understand.  That is still a consequence . . . .why should you be held responsible for another person's actions?   I like how it indicates that you won't do anything wrong if you don't want to . . .right?  Because the way I see it is that when a murderer comes to your door, you are faced with a moral dilemma.  Either lie (a bad thing) or allow a woman to die (another bad thing).  But doesn't the CI indicate that since you aren't going to kill the woman yourself, that you shouldn't be blamed for it?  Only that one person did.  You are a good person; you don't have to be in a moral dilemma; you don't deserve it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But anyway, I understand that person's argument, about it being a different kind of consequence, one in which a Kantian should care about.

      Ultimately I reject absolute morality and when you have to find a complex reason to justify exceptions you have to start admitting that hard moral rules do not fit all circumstances and tend to create more problems. It is just not a good system. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Inevitably every absolute moral system will find itself broken. For instance look at how readily in the Christian system people are willing to kill one another or claim that god wants them to kill others despite a rather strict and obvious prohibition on killing. Absolute moralities do not get the luxury of being interpreted. Interpreting does away with the entire concept of having an absolute prohibition. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While I may disagree with Kant and his ideas at least he had the balls to stick with it even when he was obviously wrong and causing far more harm than good.

      I do agree however . . .I think morality is something that was invented, and we create them ourselves.  It's all due to opinion.  I personally believe in a more emotivistic theory, which is basically just saying that all moral statements are just expressions of what you like and don't like, but I'm not sure about that either. <br/>

I do think that Kant's theory is at least interesting.

      But to say that you reject absolute morality is just a cop-out, and possibly also self-contradictory. Look at it this way: when you cite counter-examples to poke holes in an absolute system, like you do with Kant and the murderer example, you are appealing to the idea that clearly such-and-such an action is immoral in the given circumstance. But where does that feeling of "clearly" come from if not from some pre-existing 'rules' (or if that's too rigid for you, replace it with something like 'moral compass')? This is the reason that most ethical theories except for Divine Law attempt to be descriptive rather than prescriptive - they try to uncover that deeper orientation that causes us to agree upon the obvious cases. To the extent that you can provide an obvious counterexample, that just means it's an incorrect, incomplete, or insufficiently complex interpretation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kant actually had two different formulations of the Categorical Imperative, though I forget which was the later one. I think the one you take issue with is "treat others as ends, not as means". But the other, and in my opinion infinitely stronger one was (I am paraphrasing from memory here) "Act only in such a way so that you could rationally wish for the motivation behind your action to be a universal maxim". In this case, the murderer dilemma poses no problem, since it would not be rational to desire a world where everyone betrays people to murderers, as it could result in you being similarly betrayed. But even with the first formulation, you could say that not lying would be equally wrong, since you are then treating the refugee as a means. So the dilemma is that you are in a situation where you have no choice but to treat one person or the other as a means. Of course, Kant's theory doesn't provide for a way of resolving that because, like sje said, it's focused on ideal personal morality rather than proper responses to other people's immoral actions. So that's where Utilitarianism comes in. Kantian Utilitarianism is a pretty good theory.

      The second formulation (I want to say there were three for some reason) is the one I typically think of. The problem is that, based on my understanding, it's not an issue of consequences, but an issue of actions. In this case "betray people to murderers" isn't part of the equation. You have to break it down to the discrete action alone. This means "lying" consequences don't get to figure into it in any possible way nor does the context. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ultimately I see your point, but I shall choose to disagree with it.

      Oh, I agree that philosophy is a field for everyone and I would like to see more people discuss it. And I think you make a good argument, though like you said, it's the classical one, and there are numerous ways of getting around it. My issue was more with the general tone of your post, which was reductive and dismissive and had more than a whiff of "look at me, I'm shattering false idols!" To say that Kant's philosophy has been once and for all debunked is just factually incorrect, since within the relevant field there are still papers being published constantly. And to say that he is not as significant as people think is to forget that he gave birth to phenomenology and thus Continental philosophy as a whole.

      I didn't intend to come off as that juvenile, but I can see how it would come across that way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll also say that regardless of other aspects I really disliked reading Critique of Practical Reason. I can't entirely explain why, but it just really didn't do it for me. I found myself really disliking him on a personal level as well as an intellectual one. I guess the closest way I can think to explain it (as far as I remember it) would be reading Pat's philosophical works. He was just completely a dick even when he wasn't explicitly trying to be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Needless to say I also had very strong disagreements with Kant over theological matters as well.

      Don't get me wrong, I'm not Kant's biggest fan either. I also used to have outbursts about how much I hated Plato, but when I went back and re-read him a few years later, I was extremely ashamed of what an ass I must have made of myself in freshman philosophy class. So over the years I've come to generally approach any work by giving it as much benefit of the doubt as possible in order to understand it in its own context and get the most out of it. Maybe it's just low self-esteem on my part, like "this guy is probably smarter than me, and this idea seems right to him somehow, so I should try to understand why." <br/>

      When  <em>The Wall</em>  movie came out, I was something of a wretched mess, drinking myself into blackout about once a week and livening up the daily pot smoking with pretty much anything else that came my way.  At the time I had an intense relationship with something called MDA - first generation Ecstasy (MDMA), if you want to think of it that way, but way harsher on the body and much more hallucinogenic at larger doses.  After a longish binge exploring the lower depths of the Lower East Side and wallowing in several flavors of self-pity, I took myself to Times Square to see the movie.  Parts of it were  <em>perfect </em> for the state I was in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Several months later I had dried out and cleaned up, relatively speaking, and have never really felt the same about the album or the film (which was actually pretty awful).  I still really like the one track  <em>Comfortably Numb</em> .  That state of being is something that still has serious attraction.

      They were pretty good but I actually like  <em>Oar</em>  better.  There's such a haunting atmosphere about it because you know he's out of his mind, and his voice and the lone guitar, etc.  Moby Grape was just a pretty good psychedelic band.

      I know it's hard not to do, but just because you listen to what they used to call indie rock (and the divergent genres that are assumed to go with it) doesn't mean you're a hipster, just like listening to metal, hardcore, etc. doesn't necessarily mean you're a dumbfuck stoner townie.  Every once in a while I hang out in hipster bars in my small city and can barely fucking stand it; alcohol helps. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I liked this music long before Pitchfork existed.  I read Pitchfork, but that's mainly because it's a daily music site and I get bored at work.  I'm highly suspect of the site as a whole, and, for the most part, that deserve all of the disdain they receive (though their reviews don't seem anywhere near as bad as they were 6-7 years ago), but that isn't to say I don't give a listen to a lot of the bands/albums they rate highly; I ultimately don't find a lot of them to be that interesting.  But these guys are out there listening to new music everyday and writing about it everyday, I got to give them some credit for that.  Full disclosure: I used to work with the wife of a current Pitchfork reviewer; she's great, but he wasn't much of a talker the few times I saw him; kind of fit the image of a Pitchfork prick reviewer, but his reviews ain't so bad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, I had an adolescence, but shit, I was  <strong>100% SKATE BOARDER</strong>  from the age of 10, so I was a stuck-up prick, musically, since small times.  Not that I was a major musical enthusiast, I mostly listened to bands featured in skate videos.  And Guns N Roses (Appetite and Lies, nothing else).  But they weren't the kind of bands that other people in my school were listening to, so I'm pretty used to that fringe aspect of music, to an extent.  Disclaimer: this is before skateboarding was on ESPN and Tony Hawk was a household name, before the Warped Tour and getting Vans at Rack Room Shoes.  There were sizable groups of metalheads at all my schools growing up (both in the US and abroad), but only a handful of skaters/punk/college rockers in any given place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, you know, tastes change.  Just because you liked something in your youth doesn't mean you might move past it, and it's not always because some influential website tells you what's good or bad.   <br/>

      I didn't like that crap when I was in high school either though. Back then I was, well, listening to classic punk (pre-1980 would come dangerously close to excluding the Dead Kennedys and Black Flag among others... even if they formed in the late 70s), Ben Folds Five, lots of They Might Be Giants, The Who, etc. Nobody taught me to have good taste, I just never liked shitty music or had any adolescent angst and the terrible music that normally follows it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you want to find my moment of shame that would require going back to middle school when I was briefly into Aerosmith around the time that Get a Grip came out. I can't condone that, but at least that's the worst of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you get your musical advice from Pitchfork, however, you do not have good taste in anything.

      You don't have to be a snob to realize that Nickelback is an utterly bland shitty band that couldn't write a catchy tune to save their Skoal, and the segments of the population they generally appeal to are terrible. Van Halen on the other hand is fine.

      Well, well, well - here's a big, long conversation about music and shame and hatred and beauty. You know I can't resist. So here's a little of the old "tl;dr" action for ya. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Who taught you to have "good taste?"</em></div> <br/> 
Short answer: The Dead Milkmen.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
A bit of elaboration: I didn't always have bulletproof taste in music (that's sort of a joke... <em>sort of).</em>  In elementary school I thought Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses and Motley Crue would be my favorite bands forever. If two very important things hadn't happened at two different times not too much later in my life, I'm sure I would've grown up truly believing that Nickelback was just fine. In this depressing alternate reality, I imagine myself as the person who when asked what kind of music he liked, would reply in all seriousness, "Oh, I like everything." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The first extremely important happening was actually two things that occurred in rapid succession - within the space of about six months when I was about ten years old, I "borrowed" my mom's copy of Jetho Tull's  <em>Aqualung</em>  and "stole" my uncle's copy of Pink Floyd's  <em>The Wall.</em>  They taught me that an album was more than just a random collection of songs. Long story short, Aerosmith's  <em>Pump</em>  was never to be heard emitting from my room again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The second and arguably most important musical revelation of my life came when I was about twelve or thirteen. It was a fluke. A cousin of mine was listening to  <em>The Dr. Demento Show,</em>  of all fucking things, and heard a song called "Punk Rock Girl." She thought it was really funny. I thought it was hilarious, too. Still do. But while she was laughing through the whole thing I was hearing something else, too. The sound of the guitar, the pace of it all - it was like nothing I'd ever heard. I just felt something click right away. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My cousin could actually drive, so she went to the mall and bought  <em>Beelzebubba.</em>  Within days she found that the rest of the album wasn't quite as zany, or whatever - she found that it wasn't a "comedy album," and decided she'd sell it. Before she could take it to the record shop, I offered to buy it. I brought it home. I didn't take it out of my tape player for a month. When I finally did, it was just so I could put in the tape I just bought, which was  <em>Big Lizard in My Backyard.</em>  Throughout the following year, my allowance was dedicated solely to the task of collecting everything they had released to that point. In the years that followed I was first in line at the record shop on the day of every new release. Thankfully, I lived in a little shit town at the time, so I  <em>was</em>  the line. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, that was the "change." I'm not saying I never liked any embarrassing bands after that. There were still Red Hot Chili Peppers and Descendants phases yet to come and go (though, I have since made my peace with both, and will still take  <em>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</em>  for the occasional spin, mainly due to my undying appreciation for the guitar work of Mr. John Frusciante). But never again would my eyes be blinded by ignorance when it came to what music was great and what was shit. The Dead Milkmen, above all, taught what to hate, and for that I will for ever be in their debt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, yeah - Dr. Demento taught me how to have good taste. I'll take that over Pitchfork any fucking day.

      I want a poll to find out how many people actually like the Shaggs and don't listen just for the novelty.  I admit there are many things I listen to for the novelty--part of the reason I like Captain Beefheart now is because it annoyed my roommate last year and I played it constantly; I now appreciate a good portion of Mr. Beefheart's material.  BUT "My Pal Foot Foot" is just not listening-music--for me, at least.  The novelty of it is fun, but I don't LIKE it.

      I'll let you poll me (don't let redphilip know - I think he thinks I'm part of his harem now), but you'll have to make a third catagory. I listen to The Shaggs out of novelty  <em>AND</em>  I like them. Dig?  <br/>

Beefhart, on the other hand,  <em>is not</em>  a novelty act. However you feel about it, it is art.

      'Moanin At Midnight" is a fantastic song.  Also, much more understated and of a different music genera worth listing to is Fats Waller, in my book.

      Whoa.  People actually know who the Shaggs are?  Wow. <br/> 
Well, they are better than the Beatles* and is they did Kurt Cobain's fifth favorite song ( <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201130852/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTNo80YmRVM&amp;feature=related">Philosophy of the World</a> ). <br/>

I find it incredibly cute, and I do like the sound. <br/> 
Novelty act, however?  Not purposely, of course, but yes.   <br/> 
Teh reason I know them, by the way, is that they grew up in the town right next to mine.  Apparently they are the most famous band from New Hampshire. <br/>

      God do any of people listen to normal people music? <br/>

Like whenever music comes up it's always like  <em>"Oh hey everyone ever listen to The Cat Fuckers?"</em>  and everyone is like  <em>"Oh yeah man their third album <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Always Rape At Midnight</span> helped me through highschool."</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, I'm all for obscure acts and shit but I'm scared that if I bring up something like Cap'n Jazz or Jawbreaker you all are gonna yell at me and tell me to listen to Watermelon Sodomy if I want a real music experience and I'm just not ready for that.

      I listen to lots of Beethoven.  Also Bach.  And Rossini <br/>

La Gazza Ladra fucking  <em>rocks</em> ! <br/>

And no, I am not being ironic.  I do actually listen to this on a regular basis. <br/>

Along with Talking Heads, The Doors, and David Bowie. <br/>

Most of the newer stuff you guys discuss is stuff I have never even heard of, much less heard.  But that's OK.   <em>The Ode to Joy</em>  is the greatest piece of music ever written, as far as I am concerned.  I will remain content with that.

      Okay, so you've listened to Beethoven's late piano sonatas? I can't remember the one specifically- maybe #32? It plods along, and you know how this guy could plod- and then- remember this is in 1816 or whatever, written for posterity- breaks into (what I believe is) the first boogie-woogie, stride piano riff written. You'll know it when you hear it.

      Ditto again.  Years ago I studied 'cello, and seemed to live within them (and the Bartok quartets as well).  I'd spend weekends listening to them all, in order, reading along in the pocket scores from Boosey & Hawkes.  In spite of the crappy hi-fi stereo I had at the time, the experience was transforming.

      Pinball was really a minor part of it that was added later on. I prefer how it deals with the inevitable hubris of spiritual gurus that leads to their downfall even when they're essentially trying to do good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the ones who intentionally try to mislead people for personal benefit are the ones who actually succeed and go on to produce vast empires of wealth and influence: see John Smith, L. Ron Hubbard, Oprah.

      In the future I believe that the only religions left will be Scientology and Oprahism. <br/> 
I have to wonder though.  I read Battlefield Earth in seventh grade, and I loved it; it's one of my favorite books (currently number 3).  But someone told me recently that there are scientological(word?) ideas in there.  Is this true?

      Yeah. It was written after he developed Scientology, but apparently it is not focused on it. I haven't read it myself, but from what I can tell on Wikipedia it apparently has a good deal of his anti-psychiatry babble in it and not a hell of a lot else about Scientology. <br/> 
 <br/> 
More distressing was learning that apparently Neil Gaiman's father is a significant British Scientologist.

      Oh.  Forgot to check Wikipedia. <br/> 
I don't even remember those parts of the book (except the throwaway line about the "long ago cult of psychology".)  I really liked that book though, and was surprsied to read the criticisms . ..of course I was 13 at the time, and it was one of my first "adult" books, and maybe I didn't have good taste then. <br/>

      Well it was the big hit that the studio needed.  But yes, the whole idea of messiahmania (shit did I just create that word, I hope so) and even the idea of shutting off the senses to achieve a higher state blah blah blah is interesting as hell.

      A Quick One While He's Away is definitely the best story. Although it seems to hinge on the idea that your girlfriend's friends will set her up with skeezy dudes named Ivor for whom she will totally give it up with little thought or hesitation. The live version on Live at Leeds was excellent primarily because of the additional dialogue before it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Actually, both Tommy and Quick One hinge heavily on coming home and finding your lover being rammed by someone else. Perhaps this was a significant concern for Townshend? <br/> <br/> <br/> The whole idea on shutting off the senses was because Townshend fell into that bullshit spiritual nonsense.

      I'm not saying his wife was ever actually found  <em>in porke delecto</em>  with someone else, just that maybe he was really worried about that happening or felt that people in general considered this to be one of the main fears. <br/>

      It is truly the best part of that show and I totally subscribe to the idea that the Stones saw the Who as upstaging them and canceling it.  They rocked in so many ways, not least of all when Keith threw his drum and hit the cymbal  <em>perfectly</em> .  And there were some other pretty good performances: Taj Mahal, Jethro Tull, the Dirty Mac (not Yoko's screeching of course) and "Sympathy for the Devil" specifically by the Stones was good.  But the Who owned the stage.

      Yeah I think you basically have to be a certain age to enjoy old-school emo and punk: either too young to have found out about them when they were still bands or old enough to have seen them live and can say that the current state of both genres the bands formed (well, Jawbreaker didn't start anything per se, it was just the first band I could think of) is in disarray.

      I thought it might be possible that it was just a strange coincidence. That is a strange coincidence. <br/>

Anyway, the song is " <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201130852/https://www.lyricstime.com/dead-milkmen-when-i-get-to-heaven-lyrics.html">When I Get to Heaven</a> ." It's not one of their better songs. I mean, I like it, but it's nothing that anyone should start with. Anyway, as you'll see, this is not actually a song about The Shaggs, per se. The parts throughout the song in which they are mentioned are kind of spoken under the music and have nothing to do with anything. But you'll see what I thought you were paraphrasing. And yes, this is how I found out about them.

      I think the only Milkmen song I heard was "Takin' Retards to the Zoo". It was funny, but not like life-changing or anything. But I'm going to assume their other stuff is better. Plus you like Riot, so you must have good taste.

      While "Takin' Retards" is great in it's way, no, it's not truly indicative of most of their catalogue. That was when they were teenagers.

I was lucky enough to see them once with an alive Dave. I was only 15, but it's still one of the best shows I've ever seen. Life changing shit.

      Damn. Why do bands have to suck so much today, put on such generally crappy shows, and charge so damn much for them as well? That is, before we're even raped by the ticket agencies that control the venues meaning sometime you can't even buy tickets at the box office. I recall one event recently where they were only accepting cash at the box office and there was still a service fee for it.

      They have a boy to clean the money for them.  So that it is safe to bathe in. <br/> <br/> <br/> Speaking of tickets, I payed $30 for a club show in the not so recent times and it was pretty rockin.

      I don't drink myself, but when shows are about $30-40 (and often more for larger acts) you're cutting out the youth who typically made up the vast majority of concert sales. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While they couldn't always stick to it, Fugazi had the right idea: $5 shows and $10 albums. At a lower price fans can afford to go to more shows more often and it just ends up working out better for everyone including venue owners. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If a show is only $10 or so I'm going to be a lot more willing to take a chance on an unknown band or one that I simply don't know very well. For local mid-week acts if your door is only $5 or so it's worth it as the local bands playing need the exposure more than anything. When smaller acts are charging $20 or so I just have to consider whether I'm really that interested anymore. So many clubs have awful sound too. Sure it's not going out, but I'd rather spend that same money by buying some albums that I can listen to for years to come.

      Most punk and hardcore shows that I went to around the early 2000's were $10, and so were the CD's and shirts that were sold there. Metal shows were a different matter, since the scene is still to some extent controlled by managers and A&R douches who are slick, greedy, middle-aged fat guys with ponytails and New York accents. I can't believe that anyone would buy a $35 t-shirt, but they did.

      Depending on who you see now, good shows of bands that aren't on major labels will only set you back upwards of 18 bucks (still a lot though). <br/>

      Exactly. That's still a lot of money. Especially for a band where I've maybe heard one or two songs on their Myspace page. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I both don't have that kind of money and if I did it's not a good investment or low enough that I could afford to go frequently and thus sort the wheat from the chaff accepting that I'll see some shitty bands, but also see some great ones.

      Very true as well. If you're willing to help out at the show you can see shows at 924 Gilman for free. Of course, that's what comes when you're running a non-profit venue. Some great bands have played there, but sadly most of the ones to go on to any real success (and not playing there post-success) were crappy pop-punk acts that I loathe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, I do recall seeing punk and hardcore shows in people's basements and backyards in high school for maybe $5 or less.

Then again I saw temporary tramp stamps the other day. Maybe our society is forever ruined. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In my mind you are allowed a tattoo if you were a)In the military; must be related to being in the military in some way b)in prison; should ideally also be related to being in prison or some derivation thereof c)an established badass; this category may and likely will overlap with one of the two previous categories so feel free to intermingle tattoo styles with each. <br/> 
 <br/> 
These are the only cases in which tattoos are acceptable and are generally not optional.

      True. I can't believe I forgot about it. I guess I just got sidetracked by naval tattoos in a). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Being in a gang of any sort qualifies under b). Essentially you will probably eventually qualify for it so it's considered OK to maybe get some of it in in advance. The Yakuza also get a special dispensation in this category.

      Sailor do have to restrict themselves to either nautical themes or those relating to places they have been. The loneliness of being a sailor and absence from loved ones on shore is considered a nautical theme for these purposes, but we both know when you're working within the established boundaries and when you're taking it too far.

      Seriously. Someone is going to have an enormous blue tattoo of swallow's wings enveloping her collarbones. They're going to go into a room and sit down in front of a man in a suit and the man in the suit is going to say, "Okay, so what makes you think you're the best candidate for the accountant position at this practice?" or something similar.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
They may have degrees. They may have all the knowhow. But that dude in the suit is just going to be looking at her, thinking, "What the shit is that on his neck? Are those devil's horns? Or wings? What? Why does he have wings on her neck? Is his neck dead, and going to heaven? How could just his neck be dead?"

      Telepathic perhaps, but not telekinetic.  Given how much male behavior is governed via the sac, it is unnecessary to achieve action at a distance.  By thinking at all other sacs within range, my sac has influence far beyond what (based on cursory visual inspection) anyone might expect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, Assetbarristos, if you suddenly get a wild urge up your back that would have you behaving, shall we say,  <em>outside your norm</em> , it's maybe that you've tuned in to the frequency of my wicked, telepathic sac.

      I don't know, kamet.  I am so infrequently in the vicinity of women who might share this kind of information with me.  I would think that any parallel effect on women would be felt in the ovaries, and this likely to be misinterpreted as PMD, endometriosis, or the passing of an ovarian cyst. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As visually compelling the dangly parts are, we must not make the mistake of concluding that their respective influences are equally so.  I know that for some men, bresteses are nearly as great an influence on their behavior as their sacs.  But are women as influenced in theirs by their bresteses as men are by their sacs?  Will you teach us, kamet?

I have heard it said of certain women I have known that they had mucho balls, or mas pelotas. So, getting away from the literalistic physicalistic perspective, certain women would logically also have wicked sac,(See Tina*) and leave the breasteses to do what Nature intended them to do.   <br/>

Just one man's opinion.

      I disagree. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't get me wrong, it's not a great show.  I'm not even sure I think it's a good show, but I can't say it sucks.  It's got some pedigree: Matt Harrigan, a former SGC2C writer, is one of the main guys on this show; and it's also got vocal work from H. Jon Benjamin, if that gets your goat (I love the guy, but I'm not going to say everything he touches is gold unlike some people).  I've learned that most things the old SGC2C writers have gone on to work with are at least a little funny, or so I think. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The reason I feel the need to stick up for Assy McGee is because I was surprised when I first watched it by the fact that it didn't totally suck.  Everything about that show, in its teaser commercials, made it sound like the worst fucking idea for a television show ever: a talking ass cop with a name that must've taken less effort to shit out than "Poochy" in that Simpsons episode.  It sounded like Adult Swim had finally thrown down the "Fuck You, Audience" gauntlet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They kind of did, actually, but it was more like their usual glove slap.  Anyways, I admit I like the realistic theme song/opening, and the regular reworkings of it on the outros.  I love the fact that it had that old "we dare you to keep watching this" feel of old Space Ghost eps, especially the nearly incomprehensible Assy vocals and the inane plots.  There were actually some pretty funny lines buried in the dialogue, if you were willing try and listen to them.  It even had a commercial (and always the same one) built into the show itself in a shameless sell out.  It shouldn't have worked, but it did.  Kind of. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And that's it.  I respect the ability to take what should've been a spectacular fucking failure and turning it into just a moderate one.  Plus, there's one opening bit that is fucking hilarious: it involves a United 93-type scenario in a hot air balloon.  Wait, that doesn't sound like it should be hilarious, but it is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I was normally drunk when I watched it.

      Look, I watched it one time after a friend told me how bad it was. I had to see if it could possibly be as bad as he said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the first two or three minutes I couldn't stop laughing because I could barely understand a damn thing that walking butt said. After that though, I realized that the show sucked and didn't laugh for the rest of the episode. Fart jokes are funny in moderation. "Assy McGee" doesn't know what moderation means.

      While I'm not a fan of the show, I will say that I ended up hating it a little bit less than I thought I would. However, I will never, ever forgive Adult Swim for using it to replace  <em>Xavier: Renegade Angel.</em>  It happened the same week that they replaced  <em>Garth Marenghi's Darkplace</em>  with.....oh god, I can still barely even say it without throwing up a little bit...with the motherfucking  <em>Oblongs.</em> <br/>

      I agree, Xavier was a much better show, but kind of like Wondershowzen, it doesn't seem to stand up much to repearted viewings.  Garth Marenghi's Darkplace is something I'd like to see again; I only watched the last episode on adultswim.com once, it was pretty good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hear you on the Oblongs; that and Mission Hill I find to just be boring.  I'd say we shouldn't turn this into a 30 year old male 'WHAT CARTOONS DO YOU LIKE' thread, but shit, what else is going on this strip?

      I just found it myself a few weeks back.  It seemingly is a "secret strip" without really being secret.  I'm not kidding when I say it "revealed" itself to me (no, not its rock hard cat cock). <br/> 
 <br/> 
A long time back I went through the archives, as many have, by clicking through the "highest rated" function on the side bar.  Once you've done this all the way through, it reverts back to the top strips, and stays that way even if you go to those strips again.  So, it had been that way for like a year, but all of a sudden I noticed that there was just one strip showing up there, instead of the usual 4 or whatever.  I clicked on it, and it was that "secret" strip.  As I mention in my comment on that strip, it has relatively few comments (and much fewer views) to all the other strips preceding and following it; and the oldest comment was like 4 months old. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, you probably just want me to shut the fuck up and post the link, but it might be illegal or something, or maybe you want to experience that golden assetbar magic.  If you want me to tell you what is, just let me know.

      Even more specifically, Gold Coast Connecticut, i.e., Greenwich, Cos Cob, Darien, New Canaan, Westport, Fairfield, and certain enclaves further east.  At one time the accent was more pervasive among the  <em>better class</em>  of people.  These days we tend to call it  <em>Long Island Lockjaw</em> , since it seems to affect people on both sides of the Sound.

      Not to be rude but just because you got not only a really stupid tattoo but a plain ugly one that looks homemade doesn't mean everyone young who wants tattoos that don't make sense to other people will.  <br/>

      Oh my. Oh  <em>wow,</em>  man. I am so sorry. I just never would've anticipated that anyone would truly believe that I actually would get "100% SKATEBOARDER" prison-tatted onto my wrist. I mean, I realize that only one person here actually knows me, but I still never though that anyone would really buy that. It just wasn't true and now I feel 100% less hardcore. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But back to the business at hand. Get whatever the fuck you want tattooed on you, guitarhero. I mean, you really will be surprised at how different you'll feel about music and everything in a few years, but don't take my word for it. It's all part of growing up. Hopefully you'll at least be able to laugh about it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And to clarify, I really did think you were messing with me toward the end, there, but just because I found out who Showbread was and listened to a little bit and ultimately thought they sounded like Nine Inch Nails but with three vaginas per band member instead of just one each like in NIN and when I've downed a few I sometimes genuinely forget that people don't always hate the same shit that I do so I was a bit of a prick and I didn't really mean to be and I'm still doing it even though I'm now sober and I'm really sorry about that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Holy shit. This was meant to be more of an apology but I guess I probably just made it worse. I'm in a weird mood. <br/>

      In regards to tattoo regret, I have an account where I actually caused some. <br/> 
A few years back, during basic training, there was one fellow with a heart on his wrist. What was remarkable about this was that, despite being shaped like the greating card version of a heart, it was textured to look like an internal organ. So, I had some fun. <br/> 
I asked him about the tatt, specifically why he got a set of bull's testicles hanging from his wrist. He got defensive, trying to tell me that it was a heart, I appologise, though maintaining my reasoning for the mistake, and throughout the weeks to come, he found that it looked more and more like a set of testicles. <br/> 
He has since had it removed.

 <br/> 
after reaching intellectual maturity and onwards, there are things we grow to love that we will always hold a certain fondness for no matter how old we get. i believe achewood to be one of those things, dinosaur comics as well. so for the next 3-5 years, you walk around with a constant reminder of and homage to something that has altered and enriched the way you view life, and thereafter (perhaps when onstand stops writing because his fans are getting too annoying and power-trippy) you will look upon it with a tender nostalgia, and say to yourself "man, those were the good ol' days".

      actually, i would advise you to hold off on the showbread tat. i feel somewhat differently about bands tats because bands are sometimes like a passing fashion trend. i don't know much about showbread, but i see they're on tooth and nail and... yea. alls i'm saying is, when i was younger, i was into a lot of stuff that i can't quite take seriously anymore. post hardcore and metalcore among them. they're still fun to listen to, but no longer meaningful to listen to, if you catch the distinction. hoodies can be sold on ebay for $5 plus shipping, tats are 4 lyfe.

      Too late I got it for my 18th birthday. <br/>

Showbread is a band that's been around for ages and on more than just T&N. Showbread is more than just another "post-hardcore" band to me, it was the band that ushered me in to the world of non-radio-approved music. <br/>

      i saw Maylene and Showbread a few weeks ago (along with A Static Lullaby and two other bands that weren't as good.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Showbread was decent but they were down one vocalist so that was kinda disappointing and made me wonder exactly what that was all about and then Maylene... <br/> 
 <br/> 
i'll tell you all, everyone in Maylene And The Sons Of Disaster looks like good-ole-boys from the backwoods (which they are) who would look comfortable sitting on a porch in rocking chairs sporting overalls and sraw hats sipping from a large jug what is marked with an 'XXX'.

      Oh, definitely neither option, Falsey.  <em>So</em>  neither. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Here's the deal. I'll try (and fail) to keep this short. I've said too much on this board already. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As you may or may not remember, this boy cleanfatback posted a link to his myspace page a little while back. On that page, he had some sort of Achewood tribute track. I found this track to be thoroughly underwhelming at best and fucking irritating at worst. But I chose to hold my tongue 'cause the guy seemed decent enough and I thought he showed some serious sack in even attempting to promote in such a way and in such a place. I let it slide. But, putting aside my feeling for the track alone, what really made it difficult was his little myspace blurb-thing. I think I'm only slightly paraphrasing, if at all: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Smart Hip Hop. Wow." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Where do I even start? OK, first and foremost, why would anyone in all seriousness self-apply the label of "smart" to an artistic endeavor? If it's that goddamned smart,  <em>you probably won't have to tell people about how smart it is.</em>  Also, with the "wow" it seemed to me that he was trying to imply that smart hip hop was some kind of rarity. "Look what I'm doing! Can you believe that hip hop can actually be smart?" But even all of that would've been somewhat excusable had the track actually been even so much as slightly clever! I mean, if you're going to go through with making that kind of claim, wouldn't you at least want to make sure that you could back it up? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, I'll say that his Madvillain avatar would at least suggest that he has some idea of what smart hip hop is really about. In a way, that takes some of the heat off of him. But then I freak out all over again while wrestling with the terrible possibility that he may actually hold himself up to Madvillain, that he may think of himself as somehow the same thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know why I care, but I do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, like I said, I wasn't ever going to say anything. But, if you couldn't tell, today's board has me freaking out. I can't believe some of these entitled pricks. Then he was the tenth fucking person to say something to the effect of "We all got fucked over on Fuck You Friday lol!" and I just couldn't hold my snide little bitch slap back. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And now the floodgates have opened and I am no doubt an enemy to all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Good night.

      The case of "The guy who lames all my comments" is finally solved. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dear Mr. Rowboat, <br/> 
 <br/> 
You sure tore me a new one! Boy, I should see my face now. Seriously dude - Harsh slams. However, I am not a complete internet virgin, and my tender musical ass has been raped several times. By people with blogs, even. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, on to what I believe is the main problem in our short but fiery relationship: Context.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
For my Myspace blurb, I did write "Smart Rap. Wow." <br/> 
 <br/> 
However (this part is important), for the description of Psikotic, , I wrote the following: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Two new gods stand silhouetted against the writhing kaleidescope of history. They are Ike the Bold and Chris-of-the-many-eyes. Each squints into the future with Clint Eastwood-like splendor, pondering the eternal, the maternal, the internal and everything between. Out of their bulging brains emerges fantastic music of the sort associated with the arrival of angels. All shall kowtow in awe and sheer terror. Cool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's dumb, but it does provide a hint as to the intent of the "Blurb." <br/> 
 <br/> 
... <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's right! It's all exaggerated for comedic effect - I have no illusions about my talents, but I'm  <em>acting</em>  like I think I'm the best ever! It's like I'm using Irony in the form of Hyperbole. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Here's wikipedia on the subject: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Verbal irony is a disparity of expression and intention: when a speaker says one thing but means another, or when a literal meaning is contrary to its intended effect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hope that clears that up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
PS: I don't like my song about Achewood either! It sucks ass! <br/> 
PPS: I have never compared myself to the Immortal Doom. <br/> <br/> <br/>

      I personally thought the track was pretty decent.  Granted, I know nothing about music, but it was better than I expected.  The verbal irony was done a lot better than  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201130852/https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSupremeSatanists">The Supreme Satanists</a> . <br/> 
I saw that blurb and I thought it was incredibly . . .dumb sounding.   <br/> 
Rowboat, I still like you.  It is fine you are mad.  But I am annoyed at cleanfatback for both his original comment (Seriously.  Stop complaining about having to pay a couple of bucks when the vast majority of the strips are free.) and his response was way too ironic, in the meanest sense of the word.  "Boy, you sure tore me a new one!"  Ugg.

      God, this is getting fucking ridiculous. I drink beer one night and start a bunch of shit which carries over into the next day. I drink wine later that night and read over everything and get all gushy with the apologies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just a few quick points: <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am at fault for not picking up on the comedic exaggeration. I was rash. The combination of words just made me see red. I didn't do my research. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is true that I didn't like the track, but that had nothing to do with anything here and I was wrong to mix that up with being pissed about you vocally joining the Dissatisfied with Pay Strips Faction that has emerged. I'm a loyalist to a fault and I will continue to defend with bitchy comments and lames Onstad's right to make a living however he chooses. Still, that had nothing to do with your music. If I had something to say I should've said it when you linked to it originally. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If there is a mystery involving someone laming all your comments, I'm sorry to say that it is not yet solved. I've  <em>maybe</em>  lamed you twice, only once that I can clearly remember (above). I'll prove it with your help; set your lame limit to one and take another look at your comments. The mystery will then be solved. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just keep doing what you do.

      Fair enough. Just hating on the "tl;dr," I didn't see it as self-evident sarcasm, and it's all over the rest of the 'Net in sincerity, and really doesn't make sense in the context of Achewood fans, Achewood being all about the language. That's not to suggest that every post here is worth reading; almost none of mine are. Just that some of the best posts in the Assetbarrio are some of the longest.

"aw yeah this oral sex is pretty much okay, but it would be a lot better if you were like, under some sort of ceiling that I could see through, but you couldn't overcome, ya know?  like maybe if i paid you twenty cents less for this fellatio than I paid the guy who did it a few days ago. boy, that would really increase the girth of my erection, which by the way, is all that matters."

      As with any tattoo, you must ask yourself: "Will I still think this is cool in the distant future?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Right now there's an old man somewhere in Florida who wears turtlenecks every day in the sweltering heat.  Once upon a time, getting the Morse code for "SOS" tattooed on the back of his neck seemed like a sure way to attract the hot nrrrd ladies.  Nowadays he's not so sure.

      It's an evolutionary thing.  Having lots of hair on your body increases the insulation, and makes it easier for you to stay warm. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Any Northern European can be hairy.  Or Northern Anywherian. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I was <b>not</b> complaining.  Actually I could give a fuck.  Lots of hair, little hair, no hair; it don't make me no never mind. <br/>

I am only a little bit Danish.  By brother-in-law and his family are <i>born in Denmark</i> Danish, and they are not hairless by any means. <br/>

Some of them are blond, though.

      This is a very scary concept, turning yourself into something that looks like this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even scarier (to me) is the thought of a woman who wants this guy to fuck her.  Having this face over her, grunting and moaning during the ultimate physical intimacy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Much less the possibility of this creature impregnating you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will have nightmares tonight starring that hypothetical woman.

      Actually, now that I look more closely (what the fuck is wrong with me?), it kind of looks like the Virgin Mary. <br/>

So, maybe his choice to tattoo a cat's ass onto it was a little short-sighted.  He could have spent his life as a tourist attraction in Meso-America, and never had to work again.

This is a tit I will  <strong><em>NEVER</em></strong>  place any part of my body next to, other than by accident in a crowded place. <br/>

Yecch! <br/>

      Don't be in any hurry.  The fact that the center-right technocrat who just won the election is half black is not without historic importance.  But it is not at all in the cards that we will see major shifts of policy.  Give it six to twelve months before bothering with all that paperwork, until you can see whether 'better and brighter' proves to be more than a cosmetic makeover, whether the new regime is simply a smoother, more polished form of imperial management.

      Your optimism is charming.  I hope you are not too disappointed with the reality.  Again, the point is whether the changes will be more than cosmetic.  In my view, from the perspective of politics and policy, Obama is just another neoliberal white guy, albeit one who is less melanin-challenged than most. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The last eight years have been a horror show without doubt.  The Bush regime has been like one long butt rape without lube.  The Obama regime will more likely use KY and a condom, and may have some creepy idea that it was actually a 'date'.  So I suppose we'll end up grateful, don't you think?

      Sure you can.  I am quite often pleased, and by a great many things.  I'm sorry you think it mean and patronizing of me to try to damp down some of the entirely misplaced euphoria that has greeted Obama's anointing.  A New World didn't greet the dawn on Movember 5, and it won't on January 20.  If I'm a prick for saying so, so be it.  I won't quarrel with the description leftist in the least.  I took the name RedPhillip because of more than my hair color.

      Dude!  That is exactly what this whole fucking charade is about.  The last 40 years the United States, that is her manifold corporate lackeys, have, under cover of darkness and deniability been doing most of the nasty, self-centered shit on this planet.  The bloodbath in Iraq is the culmination and is so "out" that pretty much the whole world hates us now.  Only!  Only!!!!  Only what?  Oh, look at the "land of the free!"

      Since we're all just sitting here waiting for something to happen that ain't gonna happen, let me ask a question which there may not be an answer to - how did there come to be so many Oklahomans on assetbar? Do you all know each other? I mean, for just being a random Midwestern state there are just a crazy concentration of you. I am also in a random Midwestern state and in my year plus of perusing these boards I've encountered maybe three or four fellow Missourians, one of whom is an actual person I know, and so does not count. Is it just that you all have more time on your hands, what with drinking being illegal there and everything?

      The way I see it is thusly: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1.  We are in Oklahoma.  It's not like we have a lot else going on. <br/>

2.  We are more likely to bitch about where we live, since we live in Oklahoma. <br/>

3.  We live in Oklahoma.  We take what we can get. <br/>

4.  We live in Okla-fucking-homa. <br/>

      The story of Lot is no worse than the story of Orpheus and Eurydice.   It's no better, either, and makes one equate God with Hades.   I agree that "don't look back" is a particularly asinine, arbitrary and vindictive rule that doesn't seem to be based on the idea of "testing faith" so much as "enforcing the doctrine of divine schadenfreude."

      Beef is a dick in that last panel. It's the way he says he disapproves of Ray's choice in women. He doesn't say that Ray likes the wrong kind of women - he says that Ray  <em>doesn't like the same kind of woman</em>  he does. First, that is  <em>arrogance</em> , but second, he should know better: if his Best Friend liked the same kind of woman, then his Best Friend could be attracted to his Wife, at which point Circumstances would step in and arrange a terrible affair with which to destroy his marriage.

      Nah I think Beef has hit upon something important. This is my problem too - I give girls too much credit and assume that they are smarter or more dignified than they are. And it's not even so much that I wouldn't be attracted to stupid girls, it's more like I have no idea how to talk to them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Example: I am at a party and somehow inexplicably I have ended up talking to this fairly attractive girl. So we are going through all the introductory "oh who do you know here/ where did you go to school" crap and she asks me what I do, so I say I'm in grad school, and she asks in what. Wanting to avoid a lengthy explanation of my interdisciplinary program with an 11-word title, I simply say "Humanities". At which point there is a five-second pause after which she says: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Oh... so you're like... a humanitarian?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I'm just thinking "ok you're hot, but I seriously have no idea how to continue this conversation". I don't even remember what I answered, I may have just mumbled something and walked away.

      I should clarify a bit, as taken the wrong way my comment would be a tad sexist.  The key thing here is that it is targeted at sluts.  Dumb skanks looking to put out in exchange for standing next to a cool guy.  There is a certain wink and nod among guys that specifies whether we are talking about speed-lays or actual women we want to date and treat as equals.  A real woman should be impressed by math skills.  A slut is impressed by making lots of money. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I were trying to impress you daedala, I would discuss the difference between Ito stochastic calculus, and Malliavin stochastic calculus.  And then I would show you my gigantic manhood.  (And then I'd probably chain you in my basement for a month, but that would be after the makeouts and wine)

I'm just not used to nudity on Assetbar, is all.  I don't mind the nudity so much, but you know . .. . <br/> 
You can keep them up.

      yes. they were pictures of me. all of them.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i didn't realize assetbar was a no nudity type of establishment. plus like, how is a picture of a tattood penis with ladies lickin it any more appropriate than a picture of a tattooed penis on a lady's boom booms? <br/> 
 <br/> 
i.. i took them down so i can't put them up again. i'm still not really sure what to make of you, sje. you all made me start thinking about how i'd make a bad mother, though this is probably still the case.

      It's a shame that you'd get such a negative impression of someone just because they have tattoos. I love seeing people with really well done tattoos. I think there are definitely a higher proportion of low quality to high quality tattoos, though, just because they've become popular so now there are many people who almost seem to care more about the experience and having a crazy story to tell than the quality of the work. Or those who get them to look tough, cool, or sexy.

      For the taking off of clothes it matters nothing how you define your sexuality.  For little else, actually (I speak from long experience in Science).

      That's true.  With naked boys one is usually renting.  When I buy pictures I go for the moving kind.  Solos are boring, though, even when the boy in question is exceptionally 'talented' whether in skill or attributes.

      Should the lad try to jerk a flaming chainsaw I'd think it would be the last jerking with that hand, ever.  But you're thinking, trying to find an act that will set you apart from the crowd, and that's a good thing.

Logic is the opposite of religion.  IT is not a religion.  We do not take the rules of rationality on faith.  This does not justify taking God on faith.  Especially since the "religion" of science does not force probably incorrect morals on others.

      I'm really not too committed to arguing on the Internet...  Short version, of course logic has nearly-immeasurable practical value.  The game is rigged because the only accepted way to argue is logically, and when one debunks logic with logic, well, that is kind of silly.  But logic is slippery and fallible and shifts with worldview.  The common western academic construction of logic most of us would utilize is necessarily limited.  Basically what I want to say is that logic cannot explain everything and privileging it before other perspectives is unfair and comparable to the way religion functions, i.e. forcing probably incorrect morals on others.  Don't think science and logic have all the answers?  Pshaw, sir, you are a fool! <br/> 
Re: living without logic for a day: do more psychedelics.  Also, I will pass on a witty rejoinder, but I was unaware that logic as a religion was a parroted mantra.  I would find it difficult to believe that this is more common than the notion that science and logic rule all.  Guess it depends on your department?

      If conventional science and logic don't have the answers, you can probably at least find the reasoning behind the question in human psychology.

Logic is  <em>all</em>  there is.  I don't even think the world can exist without logic.   <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>and when one debunks logic with logic, well, that is kind of silly.</em></div> Which is what you're trying to do? <br/> 
Logic is, by definition, not slippery at all, and I don't see how it can shift with world view.  "If P then Q, therefore if Q then P" is NOT true in America.  Are you saying it could be true in China?   <br/> 
The notion that science and logic rule all.  I don't even understand what this means.  Science is a process, first of all.  How can it rule?  And logic is the study of the principles of reality.  A study can't rule.  A process and a study can't hold any answers either, only the people can, and if they don't now, doesn't mean they can't. <br/> 
My point was, basically, that the world will always act in a rational way, and it will regardless whether humans are alive or not.  It ain't no religion, son. Religion is belief in faith, and faith involves accepting a conclusion without any proof, and accepting the conclusion even if something contradicts it.   <br/> 
Now, when people say that science involves faith, then I often don't know what to say.  You accept that the future is going to be like the past, which I believe Hume said is illogical.  Will, it certainly isn't irrational like religion is.  Valuing science brings progress to oneself and to society as a whole.  Following religion stagnates us, and takes us away from our goals by distracting us with other, fake goals. <br/> <br/> <br/>

Well, thanks for clearing that up. I think you've got a pretty airtight religion there yourself, Assetbar Philippe. Tough choice between yours and the other Philippe's worldview.  <br/> 
  He has a blanket, you have a blanket statement view.  <br/> 
 Maybe, instead of being snarky, I should have just asked you for your definition of logic, since you seem to imply it has sentience or at least motivating force. <br/> 
 But snark,....well, I don't think the world can exist without snark.

      Although it seems unlikely that Philippe will ever leave the age of five, it seems very evident that he is a very intelligent boy, and his worldview would be one which embraces anything that promotes happiness, and would, hopefully, reject anything that stagnates progress and happiness, like what the contemptable meme of religion does.  I do not believe that I am speaking with snark, but confidence.  Logic is not a religion . .. logic and science do not accept any beliefs, because they are processes, and processes simply can not do this.  Neither do the two mandate any sort of behavior.  <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>1 a  (1): a science that deals with the principles and criteria of validity of inference and demonstration : the science of the formal principles of reasoning  </em></div> .  All it is is a study, as science is the process of gathering information.  I do not believe that I meant to imply that either have any sort of consciousness or should force us to do anything.  All I am saying is that overall they mean only good things for humanity, unless science is abused to make bad technology.  It is far from anything resembling religion--or at least supernaturalism (because I have no idea what the heck Buddhism is).  What I meant by the quoted statement is misleading.  I meant that if we do not accept logic--that is, we act in such a way that does not follow reason--then we have nothing.  We need logic in order to make sense of the world, and to know what to do next.   <br/> 
Basically, all I am saying is that science is not a faith, but a process, and that such a claim should not be used to justify belief in any type of supernaturalism or unfounded moral principles.  If you really want to call humanism a religion, fine.  Just don't put it on the same level as any belief system that only promotes itself and impedes human progress.   <br/> 
I am sorry for the snark; I just feel passionately for things. <br/>

      I'm not positive what you are saying here.  Religion--supernaturalism--conflicts with science in that, well, it causes people to believe that the earth is like 10,000 years old instead of millions.  It all depends on the religion we are discussing, of course, and how orthodox the person is, that is, how brainwashed the person is.  As far as I'm aware, most mainstream religions and denominations would not take science over faith, especially if science threatens a core belief.   <br/> 
Separate magistera (is that the right word?). That is, religion should be concerned with religious things and science should be concerned with scientific things, and the two should not have to interfere.  Religion should deal with "the bigger questions".  Like what?  The meaning of life, what comes after life, etc.  Well, why not use science and reason?  It seems to point towards no afterlife (I believe) and with the meaning of life . .. I suppose you make your own.  The point is that there is no reason to make up a being in order to have a reason to live.  I don't know if science or reason can answer those big questions . .. but can religion?  Is just making up an answer a good response?  Wouldn't making up a pretend being to answer these question influence people to make up legends about the entity, and then to write books about the entity, in which the entity tells us what to do, and people believe these stories and go ahead living their lives by an incorrect moral code, committing real harm (see: crusades, spanish inquisition, 9/11)? <br/> 
And by saying that science and religion should be separate, are you suggesting that science should stay not be able to attack religion, but do you expect me to believe that religion won't use science to its advantage?  If they discover--through science--that Jesus lived, and Mary was a virgin, etc,, would the religious community just shrug and say "That's science . . .we don't care what it has to say . . ."  Of course not!  They'll run with it! <br/> 
What I'm against is faith, especially faith in supernaturalism.  I don't know if you have faith in supernaturalism.  But if that is what you are basing your morals off, then I have to say that you are not justified.  Sure, religion has a lot of good morals, but the problems lie in morals that no longer seem so logical, and new circumstances which Biblical peoples did not have to deal with, like birth control, and advances in science, which is starting to show that gays don't choose to be gay.     <br/> 
All I am saying is to base your moral code on something a little better than a book told you so, because you could be doing real harm.   <br/> 
If by leading a holy life you mean more of a  <em>spiritual</em>  life, then whatever.  As long as your moral code is justified.

      You're on your own here, sje. My quarrel with religion has never been that it brainwashes people or promotes war and intolerance, etc. I tend to think that sometimes, yes, but I also suspect that people can and will just as easily find other excuses to be shitty to each other. My main problem is just the sloppy cliches masquerading as logic that people use to justify it and to attack science as being no more valid. In that regard, I have just as much of a problem with trendy liberal 'spirituality' as I do with dogmatic Bible-thumping. At least the latter are somewhat consistent in their beliefs.

      It's not that people are looking for excuses . . . it's that people are genuinely thinking that they are doing good when they are not.  Those terrorists actually thought they were doing a good thing on 9/11, because of how religion brainwashed them (I am reluctant to use that word, actually, but I don't know what else to use).   <br/> 
I prefer spiritualists because--although annoying--they are  <em>not</em>  consistent in their beliefs.  That is, if anyone proves them wrong, they will change.  They jump to weird conclusions sometimes only because they like them, but that's better than sticking with something and refusing to move on despite everything.

      Well there's caveats. I mean, almost every civilization on earth has a concept of murder. I think there a few tribes where there is so much harmony that no body has killed another person in thousands of years so it's possible that they don't have a concept of murder, but there's murder pretty much anywhere. But the definition of murder is pretty much "to kill someone unlawfully" which implies it is possible to kill someone lawfully (examples: self-defense, protecting others, and - to some - capital punishment). And some even define "lawfully" in different ways. For terrorists, it may be against the law to bomb a place, but they answer to a higher law, namely their God. And of course, many of the American revolutionaries believed they had a God-given right to wage a war of independence against Britain. And it's codified in the Declaration of Independence as a "self-evident" truth -- so you don't even have to look to religion for your higher law, because this truth will supposedly make itself apparent to any reasonable person, including atheists. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So the standards are nebulous and kind of weak on further review, but they are so widespread it is hard to find fault with them. I'm not necessarily an emotivist...I'd say I'm more an existentialist/constructionist when it comes to morality. I think morality isn't self-evident, because even though there's a lot of agreement, there's enough disagreement for the reasonability standard to be unreliable. But reasonable people do look beyond their mere emotions to make a more cerebral view of morality. There's no inherent meaning to existence, but to me, meaning is a free canvas. And we thereby make morality by reason and consensus.

      Wrong?  It isn't right or wrong to just stab someone, it happened.  If you stabbed someone, and a bystander said, "He just stabbed that guy!" that can be right or wrong based  upon what transpired.  Not, "He was wrong to stab that man."  You may have been... unjust?  I am not one to be held under such notions. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Muslim Extremists aren't wrong.  They blew up the Trade Centers because they believed it was a way to acheive their goals.  Their goal, if it were to kill thousands of people and ignite a panic, was succesful. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am saying there is no right or wrong.  Noone deserves anything, we are presented with opportunities and how we handle them is what makes us who we are.

      This is too much summation stuff, sje46. You think too much. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 You know what the Buddha say, yes? "Quit thinking so much. Observe more, conclude less. Dis-opinionate, young Jedi."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Belief systems are for those who can only believe pre-set programs without questioning, for their own fear limits them from experiencing. In believing, therefore, they forfeit experiencing. Fear of life. A true system should enable the practitioner to be able to discard the system once its ideals are embedded. Drop the raft. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ignore the cult of Christianity and relate to Christ. Forget the Buddhism and grok the Buddha. Who said this? Both said this. <br/> 
 They were about freedom, inner freedom, not political, and not about starting cults. <br/> 
 Where did Christ say piss on organized religion? Everywhere. <br/>

      In the part of Flyover Country where I live, it's "A Whole Bible, not a bible full of holes." <br/> 
 <br/> 
In other words, every single word in the bible is the exact literal truth.  If it is in the bible, then it happened  <em>exactly</em>  the way the bible specifies.  Believing anything else is heresy.  Questioning whether someone believes it literally is calling his faith into question, and therefore insulting him.  It is calling him a "bad Christian."  It is the height of effrontery. <br/>

      It's like when a person takes offense when you question his fundamental view of the universe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It doesn't matter if you  <em>mean</em>  offense or not.  Nothing could be less relevant than that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You have implied that what he believes in to the core of his being is nonsense.  I can't see how that could  <em>not</em>  be offensive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Imagine:   <strong>Sje46</strong> , emotivism is fake made up nonsense.  You don't really take that stuff seriously, right?  You know it is just stories told to put morals into context, right?  You don't really believe it is  <em>really actually true</em> , right? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, imagine someone saying that to you, when your entire life depends on emotivism.  Not just your life, but your eternal soul, and where you spend the afterlife, and whether you are perpetually and unconditionally loved, and whether your life truly has meaning. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It wouldn't matter in the slightest what whether I  <em>meant</em>  to insult everything about you.  I insulted everything about you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe they are fools.  I am still going to avoid insulting them to the core of their being by questioning the relevance and veracity of their core beliefs.

      I am not saying you should be blamed. <br/>

I am talking about politeness.  Politeness means you avoid causing offense, whether it is justifiable or not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Look, go ahead and do whatever you want.  I am sorry if you took offense at what I said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just know that if I question someone's religious beliefs, there is a chance I am going to cause offense.  Religious beliefs are like that.  And religious beliefs that are strong enough can result in strong offense.  Politeness says it is not worth it to take that chance. <br/>

      Sj, the stories in the Old Testament are exactly that, stories.  Many are allogorical, not to be taken literally.  Some are very old, probably from an earlier oral tradition.  Yet there is meaning in each story, and I believe that can be useful.  As for the miracles of the New Testament, I'm still pondering those.

      The lesson of the New Testament, as exemplified by St. Paul the Apostle, is that the actual physical presence of Jesus is not necessary for the idea of a personal God to spread.  Paul was a convert long after the events on Calvary.  It is the ideas of Christ that changed the world, not the miracles.

      Well, I would hope that one could find meaning even with the absence of God, but as long as you respect science and don't enforce the Biblical sense of morality on others, I don't have too much of a problem, although I do think that moderate Christians do enable, in a way, the extremists . ..wel, I got the polemic outta my system, and am now in a state of pensive affection. <br/>

      To be fair, science is built on a system of constantly revising it's rules to determine the new "truth".   <br/> 
So, science continues to stand on the "truth" because the "facts" are determined by the most current information believed by the current majority of scientists. <br/> 
Nothing in science is really "true", it's just the latest idea that hasn't been shot down by a new theory. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, science is a set of ideas that are believed to be true, based on a set of rules created by a select group of individuals, who search for the truth in complicated rituals in secluded rooms, speaking in language mostly incomprehensible to the general public that they learned through years of study.  They publish their beliefs in books, and try to spread the 'good word' to others, hoping that their beliefs will become the dominant theory, and be established as 'fact'. <br/>

      Well science is still based on what can be observed and discovered through actual methods that can be falsified and exposed to scrutiny, and if a hypothesis stands up to the most rigorous scrutiny available, it is accepted as a theory. I'd say that's the one rule that never changes. It only makes claims to certainty insofar as a given theory works and functions and, by all "reasonable" standards is true.

      Right about science. It's about the phenomenology of this world, period. Which is very cool stuff. It is entirely based on 5-sense observable data; so we can all conclude the same thing with the same sensory equipment. Common body of knowledge by accord. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Morality codes, religions, philosophy- have nothing to do with that, really. They're about human identity, who and why we are, how to conduct ourselves in our daily living. And most of them are partly faith-based on the unseen, which is out of science's purview.  <br/> 
 In most of them you have methodologies of practice which are supposed to enable a person to achieve some state of living or being. <br/> 
 So Pogo was talking about living the holy life. As long as a person examines what is meant by the "holy life" and have done some inner work on why they want to do that, rather than swallowing it blindly as some pleasant-sounding communion meme, then good for them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Cause you gonna go to Heaven if you do it our way" - this I find as offensive as a con-artist. There is no implied thinking or soul-searching in it. You have millions of people who are utter pragmatists in daily business, they can smell a pyramid scheme a mile away- "If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is." And these same people toss their caution and reasoning ability out the window when it comes to "You gotta be saved by the Blood, and bloh,bloh,bloh." <br/> 
Boo on Paul. You hear me, Pogo? Boo on all that.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
 So Science vs. the religions/practices/philosophies, it's almost like that Venn diagram with Bob Giacomelli.

I don't really think that religion makes too much of a difference, except maybe nice people are more prone to be religious maybe?  I'm not sure.  But there are a lot of religious jerks out there.  I'm just saying (I think) that I like people due to their personality, not just their religion.

      Read  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201130852/https://www.slate.com/id/2203614/">this article</a> . It finds that religious people in America are indeed "nicer" overall than atheists, but that the pattern only holds true because atheists are a minority here and thus feel marginalized and excluded. But as a counterexample, in Scandinavian countries where religious belief is fairly low, the crime rates are lower and social welfare is higher. What this suggests is that the important thing is not religion but community, which the Scandinavians have a strong sense of.

      This year. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Every year. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't really consider myself an atheist.  I consider myself an agnostic.  An atheist says there is no god, an agnostic says it is unknowable.  How the fuck would I know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When discussing Christianity I am an atheist.  There is no way I can believe in  <em>that</em>  god. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But anyway... <br/> 
 <br/> 
My church is not a Christian church.  The vast majority of members of my church are agnostics at least, and probably over half consider themselves atheists. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And we help villages in Africa, poor people in Central and South America, Asia, all over the world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have personally given lots of money to establish micro-banks in South America to help people, primarily women, establish businesses and work their way out of poverty. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have worked at the homeless shelter here where I live, making and serving dinner. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Atheists help people a lot, both locally and globally.  It's really got nothing to do with a belief in "god."

      That's true too. Buddhism is basically agnostic, although most buddhists are deistic. They don't even bother with "is there or ain't there" a God, and the Buddha went into chapter and verse about all these different other realms of consciousness, Gods, angelic equivalents, his other lifetimes and soap operas.... <br/> 
 They're all about doing good. Christian churches are about doing good also. As are Muslim groups. The problem comes with the Catch-22 of whatever dogma they're slipping in with the food, relief, schools, etc.

      I think it's because during the Bush years we've been on the defensive and taught to see everything in terms of political effectiveness rather than intrinsic value. So that's why you see a lot of atheists yelling that Dawkins "doesn't help" and "only makes things worse" even though they may completely agree with everything he says.

      It's not a sound argument either, just like saying you are going to "burn-a in the eternal fires-a of hell-a!!!" (you have to say that with a southern accent) isn't a sound argument, or saying that bananas prove God's existence. <br/>

      HE says that he doesn't expect to win Christians over, but only people who are on the line.  And I don't think he thinks Christians are necessarily stupid; he just thinks that religion is stupid.  A person can be smart about everything else, and still be superstitious, because religion brainwashes them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember on an internet forum, where a man claimed he hated Dawkins because he seemed like "a very angry man".  And who was a  <em>scientist</em> .  A  <em>scientist</em> , no less.  And you know how biased they are against God.  Why, why should we listen to a scientist?  I guess we should only listen to someone who doesn't know a thing about evolution and geology, and other things that don't contradict the Bible?  And the name of the book is too incendiary.  "The God Delusion".  Clearly he set out to prove doesn't exist before he had any evidence.  Or maybe, I don't know, that was his conclusion?  That God is a delusion?   <br/> 
Turns out the person didn't even read the book.  HE was, literally, judging the book by its cover. <br/> 
I have to wonder what type of person a Christian would call a good spokesman for atheism.  Someone who isn't a scientist, and does not speak assertively.  "Erm, excuse me, I don't mean to offend anyone, but I don't think that there is a god, but I'm not really positive why, and I'm sorry, but I just find it unlikely, please don't hurt me . . ." <br/>

      A good atheist spokesperson would be someone who doesn't yell at me for "pushing religion on them" yet tries to force their views down my throat and also doesn't call me a moron for believing in God and also wants to wipe out religion forever. If you don't believe that shit going down look up the Wired article about "New Atheism". <br/> 
 <br/> 
It just upsets me because, just like some Christians use blanket statements on Atheists (like I guess I'm doing) alot of arguments Atheists make are blanket statements as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know, I really don't want to argue this anymore because it's a stupid argument. Just let me not like Dawkins.

      Once again, Dawkins isn't yelling at anyone. He is not forcing his views down anyone's throat.  He is simply providing good arguments about his views.  He agrees that a person should not be indoctrinated and should make his own decisions.  It is one of his secular commandments.  It is one of the requirements to be a "bright" as well. I already said that he doesn't think Christians are morons, no more than most people believe that Scientologists are morons.  HE just believes that religion brainwashes people. <br/> 
I read the article, and it is very interesting, by the way.  I don't know what in it you are referring to, however. <br/> 
And I respectufully disagree that Dawkins uses blanket statements against theists.Really, the reason why he is against religion is similar to the reason I am against the Holocaust, although the Holocaust is worse.  He is percieving an immoral thing going on (basing morality on a false document, which results discrimination against homosexuals, and forbids abortion and test tube research, etc, and religion ignores science as well.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I respect your decision if you don't want to talk about this anymore, I just wish that people would stop expressing dislike of a person for no reason.  And I don't think you gave a very good reason at all.  But I think that you are rad. <br/>

      I think a little reflection will reveal that people with political axes to grind often don't pay attention to the intrinsic value of statements.  It's not a new phenomenon.  Do you remember what Larry Summers said to get run out of Harvard?  His remarks were pretty temperate and not contradictory to what is known about neuroscience and natural selection.

      Oh right, let me just give you what you expect to hear from me: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Irondave, both your comments and those of Larry Summers are based on heteronormative myths promulgated by white male fascists hiding behind the ethnocentric mantle of "objective" science! I say this because I am a liberal and learned these terms in college!</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry if I disturbed your pre-defined categories for a second there, I'll try to avoid it in the future. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Actually, I would say the jury is still out on whether what he said is really biological fact or not. But if it's proven false, I'd prefer that it be proven false on strictly scientific grounds rather than political ones, since it's at least  <em>theoretically</em>  possible that it could be true.

      I was just trying to work a chuckle.  Also, when you are serious, you are not usually terse. <br/>

I think all Summers said was that the ideas were worth looking into, so even if ultimately people proved there was nothing to those ideas, it wouldn't make him wrong.

It's true that  <em>annunciation</em>  has as its secondary meaning the way pompous and pretentious way of saying "announcement." <br/>

      Counting votes in 1796 was not done electronically. They didn't have cars either. Or even bicycles yet. <br/> 
 So it was very arduous, impractical even, given the increased potential for tampering, to gather up a million or so paper ballots to one place to be counted. <br/> 
 Remembering also that a million was so much more then than it is today. However, their Practicality was strong, and their Logic was passable. <br/> 
 Therefore they came up with the necessary evil of the electoral college, where each state gathered up its own voting and decided a simple winner-takes-all popular percentage based on majority as a means of expediting the popular national vote. <br/> 
 Hoping, along the way, that when electronic voting and mass communication were commonplace in this Great Nation, the Government would still possess the very least modicum of Practicality and Logic to know to abolish what had become a horrendous, unnecessary, even evil means of POTUS Selection, so that given the remote possibility an  Evangelical Social Facist party ever came about to attempt to subvert democracy and steal a popular election fronting a horrendous, malformed incubus of a personality as their candidate, it would simply not be possible. <br/> 
 Alas, they were SO FUCKING WRONG there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 That however, my son, was the rationale for their thinking. There is no rational behind it that I am aware of.

      Not only is this correct (I loved your post above as well), but the 5 or 7 that decide it wouldn't even be the biggest ones.  Ohio and Florida are awfully packed with people, but certainly shouldn't be the two primary deciders of elections.  I've always supported a proportionate electoral college.  Every state still gets the same number of electors, but they are split out based on how the popular vote goes WITHIN THE STATE.  States still get to decide how the voting is handled and counted, and the big states still get more votes (they should).  However it would take the heart of the campaign out of the few swing states and into EVERY state.  Also it would be MUCH closer to the actual national popular vote.

      Well, then it might as well be just the popular vote, no? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course someone from New York is going to have a predictably different opinion than someone in Oklahoma, but it seems odd to me that we are punished for living in a more populous state. The electoral college might have made sense when the federal government had very limited power and the states were much more sovereign, which was the original intent. But given that at this point the actions of the federal government affect all of us greatly, it seems messed up that people in Arizona are more represented than we are on issues that one could easily say affect us more (terrorism, taxes, etc.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, this last election kind of disproves the idea that the electoral college favors Republicans, though this may be specifically because Obama ran a 50-state strategy rather than the traditional Democratic campaign.

      I'm all for the nationwide popular vote to be the standard, but there is no chance of that happening reasonably.  What voting standards and technology would be used?  What groups would audit and count?  Who would determine voting requirements and areas?  No state would drop those powers.  I like proportional electorate because it skirts all those issues.

      this is what i'm for, the popular vote winning elections. <br/> 
 <br/> 
states less populated would throw their fits but it would make everyone believe once again that their vote counted...the swinging chads from Miami-Dade drive that point home and i think that since we live in a country where we're told since third-grade social studies that it's so rad to let your voice be heard 'cos in other places they can't do that, that sort of thing would be excellent.

      It was a way to get slave states to agree to the Union.  They also got to count slaves as 3/5 a person for the purpose of the census, which increased their House of Representatives delegations.  Given who electoral college votes are determined, this also gave the slave states greater influence over presidential elections than they would have had otherwise.

      There was also the "slate of electors" thing.  The thought was that people would choose people they knew and trusted to go to the Electoral College and pick who they thought would be the best president. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I was studying this in junior high, we saw a sample ballot for Oklahoma, and the actual names of the electors you were voting for was on the ballot.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't recall if this is a nation thing or a state-by-state thing, or if it is currently in force, but at one time the electors could vote their conscience.  They were not required to vote as their state had voted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It all goes back to the original ideal of representative democracy.  The general consensus was that everyday people couldn't know enough about issues to make informed decisions, so they would elect people they trusted to go to the legislatures, spend all day studying the issues and their ramifications, and make decisions based on what they believed was best for their constituents. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That has sort of gone by the wayside now.  Everyone feels that the sound bites and reports on Fox News give them enough information to make good decisions, and get pissed if their representatives don't always "follow the will of the majority."

 Did you vote this time? Or were you resigned ahead of time with that dread certainty we all had, that a blue presidential vote in Oklahoma is basically as useful as taking a piss in the alley? <br/> 
 Reason I ask is because they still do print it out that way with the party-picked electors' names below the candidates. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 If the electoral college were abolished, our votes would have counted for something more than symbolic 'tude. Our 1/150,000,000th or whatever share each would have been worth just that. Instead of bupkis, which, let's face it, is what the losing side's votes in any state is worth. <br/>

      If you think about it, the winning side's votes are also kind of worthless if you don't live in a swing state. That's why it was kind of sad seeing my friends and acquaintances here exhorting everyone to go out and vote in a city and state that's bluer than a yeti's balls. Don't get me wrong, I mailed in my absentee ballot, but I was fully aware of how pointless it was.

      Dave, what exactly do you mean by "multi-party stalking horses"? The whole point is that a popular vote would open up a greater possibility of a multi-party system,  <em>and that is a good thing</em> ! I can't understand why someone who self-identifies as a libertarian would think otherwise.

      You know, I hear the deadlock argument trotted out sometimes, and I don't see how it's any worse than having only two parties that a) do not adequately represent a nation of 300 million people, and b) nevertheless oppose and obstruct each other most of the time. A multi-party system would be the  <em>opposite</em>  of polarization, which is what we currently have. Instead of having to support a whole bunch of competing positions within a single platform, some of the parties would vote together on issues they have in common, and oppose each other on those that they don't. Nearly every other civilized country has a multi-party system and they're getting along fine.

      I have a concern that going to popular vote would empower various shenanigans in high-density areas even more than now.  Stalking horse candidates could be one way to game that system, and I should probably have just written "multiple" instead of "multi-party."  I'd be happy to see more viable parties, but our small-r republican system doesn't seem to compatible with that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Having had a day to think about what I wrote, I'm not sure what the best way to game a popular-vote system would be, but we can be confident that someone would develop it.  I don't really see what the advantage of changing would be.  The best analogy I have heard about the E. C. is to baseball:  winning the World Series means being the first to win 4 games, not scoring the most runs over all.  So that analogy suggests that the campaign that can appeal to a variety of regions (which also have a lot of people in them) is going to win, not the candidate that is most efficient in generating votes in the highest-density regions. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I would say that:  I'm a nearly life-long resident of flyover country.

      Why not proportional representation?  The first-past-the-post winner-take-all system effectively voids the significance of minority votes.  I think more people would vote if they felt that their choice would have some degree of representation, which would become possible under proportional representation and the influence of smaller parties that entails.  I realize that this is unlikely in the US given the stranglehold of the two faction/one party government we have, but it would be a far better way to do things.

      I did vote, and I am pretty sure the electors were not listed on my ballot.  It's possible that they were, and I didn't notice them, but I doubt that.  I voted in Tulsa County. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My vote did count for my State Senator, State Representative, and County Commissioner.  All the candidates I voter for in those races won.  Hooray!! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I went to the watch party for the County Commission race.  That was pretty cool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The candidates I voted for in the US Congressional races both lost.  But that was expected. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After all, we are the only state in the Union in which  <em>every county</em>  went for McCain. <br/>

My vote for president didn't count, although my candidate won.  That's fun to think about, I guess. <br/>

      Jesus! In the dim archives of memory, I remember that weird shit. Kid used a samurai sword, iirc. Japan back then, we didn't know wtf to make of them except they were flooding the country with cheap transistor radios- foreshadowing. <br/> 
 "Kids, they were our sworn enemy, but now they are democratic and our good, good friends."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 "We will shock, awe, an' subdue and then democraticicize 'em. Yes, it's true that a few Islamatists will be neutralized also. It's for their own good." <br/> 
 Damn, did that bad dogma come back to bite us in the ass.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Plus they were about sick of U.S. military stationed in bases in their country.

      But the Japanese right-wing Nationalists really had no problem with fascist politics.  And Hitler named his party the National Socialist Workers Party of Germany in part as a branding strategy because of the huge popularity of the Socialist and Communist parties in 1920s Germany.  It was a way to draw in politically unsophisticated people who were drawn to 'socialism' without knowing much about what the politics were.  The Nazis were state capitalist if anything.  There were not remotely socialist in any sense of the word.

      Judging from what I've seen on hentai sites, Rikku seems to be the most popular, with Yuna a close second. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personally, I didn't care that much for Yuna. She had very little personality, and being with someone that naive, timid, and completely good-natured would be infuriating. I wouldn't have the patience to spend hours reassuring her just to get her to say what's on her mind. She's the kind of girl who keeps a super-secret book of poetry that no one is allowed to see, and would probably just lay there quietly sobbing the whole time when you're doing it. I guess some people are into that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rikku is the girl who will drag you to underground rave parties and impromptu picnics that require trespassing on private property. She will make you feel more alive than you've ever felt, and then suddenly break up with or cheat on you for no apparent reason other than that perhaps your life is too boring to contain her cheerful and carefree spirit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not much to say about Lulu except that "bitchy, sarcastic goth" is the type I most often find myself with. Also, she has enormous boobs.

      Rude Titties.  I usually find myself dating Rikku esque females, which is good because I live in a synonym for a crappy town.  Also if I wanted to beat off to some Yuna hentai, I'd rather find Ashe from twelve.

      I didn't say whether I did or don't. In this particular instance, it occurred to me that there would be a lot of hentai with these characters and I wanted to see if I was right. Furthermore, hentai sites often pop up when you're searching for other stuff, whether it's porn or Sega Genesis roms. But anyway, I am not ashamed to say that some of the more realistically drawn non-tentacle hentai is pretty damn good.

      You think? Pat strikes me as the kind of pessimistic sourmouth to be selling short the whole past year.  <br/> 
 Maybe you right. Maybe he got tired of losing $ selling short and got out in July. <br/> 
 Whereas Ray, with Ray's luck of the fool  born under a good star, accidentally sold short in July and is now raking it in. <br/>

      Ditto. For the past few weeks it's been like when I used to live in a pretty skanky council estate outside London in the very early '90s, and the scabby family from accross the street got evicted from their house for smearing their own faeces all over the front windows and setting fire to the neighbours' car. Every day I'd pass that house and take a peek through the garden gate to see if a new family had moved in (council houses don't stay empty for long)- partly nervous, because it could be another bunch of drooling coprophiliacs; partly excited, because it could be some pretty cool family who could afford sattelite TV and would invite me in to watch the Simpsons... <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is  <strong>exactly</strong>  what it has been like living in Europe in the run up to the American Presidential Election. Except, for "skanky council estate", read "the world", for "faeces" read "unwinnable wars against abstract concepts", for "windows" read "the rest of the world", for "neighbours' car" read "unarmed civilians", and for "bunch of drooling coprophiliacs" read- er... Oh no, leave that as it is.

      The Commodore PET came out in 1977.  Roast Beef has to be at least 37 unless he got into computers before he hit elementary school.  His friends wouldn't be interested in them and he sure as shit couldn't afford one so I don't see how he would have used a computer at that age unless it was at school. <br/>

Secondly, I am only 33, and I vividly remember spending time in front of a PET at my grade school in the early 80s (My small school couldn't yet afford to upgrade to the Apple II). <br/>

      It's not particularly relevant to this strip, but over the past week it's really struck me just how much Achewood has given me.  Several of the most memorable moments and arcs in all the literature I've consumed, it just keeps popping up and I feel better for knowing it. <br/>

      You gotta read more, get to some films.  I mean, yeah, there's some laughs here, and some philosophy, but not the bleeding edge of anything.  In fact, it's really the same old misogynistic testosterone crap, just starring cats and bears instead of frat boys.

 On the other hand, his reasoning for not watching films with dialog is organically compelling. I'd give that a V-chub.

      Some things you just can not avoid, for example I did see the movie my avatar is from.  And I have seen the Treasure of Sierra Madre.  I just never really got into that "talkie" sensation, give me a good book or silent film any day.  I just do not learn much from movies and in general the pacing does not match my attention span well.  Something about hearing noises just disrupts parts of my brain, parts I need to assimilate information or to analyse it.  It's ok for an action film but more intellectual stuff flies right over my head so I've given up on the idea.

      May I recommend "Hell in the Pacific" a film by John Boorman with Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune, it has almost no dialogue, "Two Lane Blacktop" also very little plus it has Warren Oates, "The Triplets of Belleville" an animated feature with no dialogue I can remember, and Luc Bessons "Le Dernier Combat" with again no dialogue, but with Jean Reno. Hmm two of the four minimal dialogue titles I can think of are French, French is too hard to understand for even French people?

Also, I felt the plot didn't make an optimal amount of sense without all the bits they cut out, there's a reason these things are not 80 pages long.

      Good points. Sometimes you can make what is regarded as a great movie that fails miserably compared to the book source. Constant Gardener. imo.

      Books, where to start?  If you've read nothing, then "You Can't Go Home Again" by Thomas Wolfe could be a good place to start.  And "Steppenwolf" by Herman Hesse.  These are "coming of age" novels.

      I've read a lot of things (mostly sci fi or related fiction) including Steppenwolf, I'm not saying Achewood made a profound difference in my life or anything, it's just floating around in my memory.  More pieces to the puzzle that is life.  The most recent one would be that: <br/> 
Ray: Who's more legit? The cursed man, or the man who's cursed by the cursed man? Two souls chasin' each other down the same drain, dude. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not so much what Ray said as how I interpreted it, what I thought about it, and other things I was pondering at the time.

      i befriend her knowing she'd never suspect me, i slip a roofie in her cosmopolitan during girltalk, and she leans on me for support, slurring things like "i'm so drunk" and "i love you" as it's kicking in. i get her home and tie her to a chair, arms behind her, legs open, and a whole lot of rope in between just for show. we wait for you to come home because this is the chick who went with you to that party in HS but then did sex with two guys there not even one of which was you, and now you can't get an erection without thinking about opening that door to find two dudes on your beloved oh jesus oh HELL why did she do that why did she have to go and DO THAT TO ME but we'll make it all better tonight, right honey, look she's right here, she's right here  <em>for you</em> ... i'm sorry, what were we talking about?

      This is the sort of thing that happens when you are on tour.  Never enough sleep, questionable food at inopportune times, perhaps more libations than wisdom would counsel, way too much time spent in cramped airplanes breathing someone else's exhalations.  It's anything but pretty, and what it does to a body is anything but pretty.

      I don't know what's wrong with "Most Viewed" but it has some strips with onlu 300-some posts listed. Anyway, I got an earlier reading when I first logged in today, and this strip was closing on one with 1195, all I wrote down was "It's a" and I was going to post nonsense until this one was in second.  Now it's a long way to the top, and I don't feel like posting any nonsense beyond this.

      I tried a few different methods, all pretty inconclusively, but I think it's a little earlier than the Play Ball strip...though, I admit, I swear assetbar  <em>did</em>  come into existence during the Stone Lightning arc, which would make that a likely 1st strip...but maybe that was the first time I actually clicked on the "discuss" option and read some of the comments (before registering). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like I said, I tried a few different things: checking some known "old school" posters (asherdan and a few others) to see their first posts and oldest strips on "strips viewed"...but neither provides a conclusive answer (especially the latter, as it would have to have been viewed only once).  So, I went to the "Members" link and went back to the first people who registered (and, no, I didn't click all the way back, just adjusted the URL to get close to the end of the list).  Onstad is the first, and then I went through some of the others, same stuff.  Still hard to tell, though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think Onstad's first post provides a bit of a clue: it was "Do I have permission to make comments?" on the "Vlad Flowchardt" strip on 04/19/2007. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, instead of looking at comment upsurge around that time, it might be better to look at view upsurge; if you look at the Philippe Times from that month (4/13/07), you see the first time in April that the views go above 100,000 (~140K for that strip, actually, up almost over 30K from the previous days).  The first few strips in April only start with ~40K, so it's a big upsurge halfway through the month.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Besides one or two strips in April after that dipping slightly below 100K, all of the rest of the strips after that are 100K plus (and, actually, Play Ball is one of the few that doesn't quite reach 100K, but the one after it reaches almost 200K, which might mean something). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, my initial guess after this makes me want to say it started with the Philippe Times strip, but certain other things I saw point to a few days later (Either the Todd or Vlad Flowchart strips), but then again, there's (equally shitty) evidence for a week or so later, during the Stoned Lightning arc (including a few more assetbar-related comments that hint at "hey this thing is brand new" type of feelings). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fuck this we should just ask Onstad on the premium thing.

      I was way, way out of lames by the time you posted that (or maybe it was me....I can't remember anymore), but you probably got them because bitching about him not updating this has been done to death.

      So there is this guy cooking up some sausages and an egg for his breakfast, he's just pushing the sausages around a little bit and waiting for the egg to get it's film before he flips it.  The egg yolk kind of slips to one side and whispers, "Gee it's hot in here isn't it?" and the sausages spit and sputter, "Holy fuck a talking egg!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
So the dude is like, "What the hell I thought this food was dead, I am probably going to become severly ill from consuming this." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The man takes his spatula and pokes the egg yolk, golden mucus oozing across itself, then shimmies the flipper underdeath and turns it over.  The sausages start shaking and trying to crawl out of the pan after this act of murder, but they are caught and quartered his the man's perverse spatula. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also he had some toast.

      My girlfriend's shitty computer doesn't even try to load it at this point. Even my work computer is being a total diva about it. For this reason and also because of curiosity, I have decided to subscribe to the premium content. I didn't think I was going to, but as of two days ago this situation has driven me to it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let me say this - and I'm addressing the whole Assetbarrio, now - it is a sterile, dry place, the premium boards. I'm not saying that no one good is there. Falseprophet is holding court. My boy mattylite is all up ins. I'm there, and you fucking know how much you love me. Even Onstad pops in here and there which is always a treat. But still, most of the regulars are people I don't recognize who're all, like, "This is funny. Good work, Chris."  <em>Blah.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
So come on over, people. If the thirty and over crowd can afford three bucks a months, I fucking  <em>know</em>  the teenagers can. Especially the ones living in dorms and eating for free in school cafeterias  <em>[glaring at sje].</em> <br/>

      Maybe it is a little confusing. Yes - we, the aforementioned thirty and over crowd, make more money than the teenagers. But we also have a million more things that drain that money than you do (I know you're not a teenager, achilles, but I'm grouping you with them because you're under twenty-five; that's right -  <em>you done been GROUPED!).</em>   <br/>

That's my logic, partially flawed as it may be.

      Oh, no offense taken, I was sort of speaking for the teenagers as it is. Considering that I still listen to Thursday, laugh at fart jokes, and will still be living off student loans in five years, I will probably be identifying as a teenager for quite a while.

      Full Collapse was actually their second album. Waiting was their first, it came out on Eyeball Records before they signed to Victory. I don't blame people for not knowing that since they never even play any songs from it live - the only reason I know is because I am from NJ and they used to play $5 gigs in basements around Rutgers. It's not as polished and consistently good as Full Collapse, but there are some amazing tracks on there (like "Porcelain") and it's definitely worth a listen.

      Well, I'm not a Christian, I am a Unitarian Universalist.  But I am aware that there are some worthwhile things that come from Christianity.  Most of those things are duplicated in Unitarian Universalism, without the parts that are unpalatable to me. <br/>

      Great Handface Weekend? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have heard about that, but I haven't read those comments.  Needless to say I didn't participate.  I was away from Assetbar during that period, for reasons that aren't conducive to explanation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I was thinking about taking the top spot with this batch of comments, just to have something to show for the tiredness of nine days with no new strip, and all running out of chubbies 'n stuff.

      I was also on an assetbar hiatus during the build-up to handfaceiness. I happened in by chance once it was in full swing and it freaked my shit right out. It was just jarring. I was intrigued, but I had to get out of there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can see how it'd be fun, though. If something like it ever happens again I'll probably play along.

      Just for the Hell of saying it, it took three hours to get one hundred of the three hundred or so comments needed to take this one over the top.  That means finishing it off is not an unreasonable achievement. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Several have commented that it may be an unreasonable  <em>goal</em> .  I can see that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was being more than a little silly when I proposed going for the number one spot.  It really doesn't matter to me one way or the other. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do have to commend the effort of  <strong>sje46</strong>  to fling hugs about right and left, both for the comfort of all the hugs, and for the comment tally boost. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I must off to school.  I will be gone several hours.  I will look in on things at that time.  If the current pace keeps up, we will be at or near the top by that time.  If, as I suspect, things slack off, then que sera sera. <br/>

      Bereft of achewood comics as I am, tonight for supper I served two dishes from The Achewood Cookbook: Ray's Ruuude Chicken and Roast Beef's Basque Green Bean Salad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The salad involves a couple boiled eggs, so I once again had the chance to marvel at the Cookbook's instructions for boiling eggs.  So easy to remember, so reliable.  I used red onions instead of white in the salad because I had just a little bit left over and it needed to be used.  I don't know if the salad is still Basque with that substitution, it may be more Andorran.  I like to pretend the red onion bits might be bacon.  My wife liked the salad a lot better this time, because last time I halved the recipe, except I did not halve the vinegar.  Sorry, honey!  The salad is tasty and just could not be simpler. <br/>

Ruuude Chicken is roast chicken that you soak overnight in brine first.  I put a little garlic in my brine, which is one of Ray's suggestions for "Kraaazy-Subtle flavor."  I don't know if the garlic added anything to the chicken, but the brining step did indeed result in unusually moist and tender roast chicken.  I shook some mixed herbs over the chicken before roasting instead of just black pepper, so that may have hindered my ability to appreciate subtle garlic influences.  I had never brined before, but I believe I will brine again.  Teodor also has a recipe in the book that involves brining.  I may make that next, along with his Caramelized Onions.

      I was just going to ask, are any of the non-comic Achewood Supplements worth it? I'm saving up to buy the big box sets of the comics but I kinda want the cookbook and the 'zines and Nice Pete's books. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So can anyone tell me what would be worth buying and what to skip over?

      The brined pork loin.  That's one of the very few recipes I've tried so far (my own laziness), and I was a bit underwhelmed, though maybe I fucked it up.  But I  brined that fucker for 2-3 days, and it was moist and all, but still just pretty much salted pork.  The caralimized onions were pretty good though, but again, I think I could've done better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The one recipe I keep meaning to try is the toasted nut orzo.  But the most useful thing that the cookbook has taught me was it's defining mantra: don't be afraid to fuck up.  I'm a single guy who's best recipe was not burning himself everytime on the top of the oven while heating up his Red Baron mini-dishes, but while I'm hardly gourmet or hardly Hardies, I can at least cook a pork chop and some simple peppers and onions.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oddly enough, the recipe I've used the most is not from the cookbook, but the porkchop milanese from one of the books (might be a strip, too).  I use that for porkchops (and chicken) all the time.

      Well, in 1934 there was a Depression on, so folks didn't have much food. Your closets are almost certainly non-existent also, since people didn't have much in the way to wear. Gunny-sack clothing, I guess, from the potatoes they didn't eat. Nor insulation, decent windowage- things were pretty spartan. <br/> 
 But they did build houses to last, what there was of them.

      My God yes!  Always brine your white meats.  Chicken, pork, even turkey if you can fit it in there.  Don't bother brining beef.  Zest a lemon, squeeze it's juice out, and dump the zest, juice and lemon-husk into the brine too.  There are some seafoods you can brine, but those you have to be careful with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm interested in how he caramelizes the onions.  Most people do it over medium heat in an hour or so.  The super-secret awesome way is to go over low heat for like, 5 hours.  Gets a deep down brown, not just surface caramelizing.

      Given that at this moment, we are a very short way out from hitting most commented here, I feel I should post Hedonismbot's zillion different cooking tips.  I would do this right now, for the children, but I'm making french onion soup in the style of Keller.  It is almost 1 AM, and I am cooking soup.  If I walk away from this soup to type, it will be unamazing.  Also, I'd have to dry all the stock off my dong.

      Always use homemade beef or veal stock in french onion soup.  Always let it sit overnight in the fridge to let the onions and stock meld.  Always hand-cut the onions; a mandolin will make them too uneven to cook well.  Stir with a wooden spoon or erect shaft

      Okay, it's at 1963 (a year I remember well - first kiss), and I just wanted to compliment you all on a thread of epic proportions.  It contains the Obama victory, cool and disgusting tattos, a discussion of religion, runway hugs from our own Assetbar Philipe (sp?) some stuff about reading and movies, what am I forgetting?  Anyway, kudos to the crew, and good night.  I hope to awake to a new record.

      I count 96 excessive posts, so it's only about 40 away from legitimately having more. <br/> <br/> <br/> One interesting thing I found is that if you go to the "most viewed" posts, and then look at the ones with the lowest ratings, they are basically all ones where it was up for a week without any updates.

      Tom actually re-recorded little drop of poison for the soundtrack using his right forefinger as a hook because the character of Captain Hook would be playing the song in the film. Plus my recommendation is to progress chronologically. From barfly to beatnik, to Brecht, to god knows what but I like it.

      That sounds like a terrible post-hardcore band name/album title. If I had the skills, I would photoshop an album cover with faintly visible angel wings, flower petals, and unnecessarily flowing script.

      good / stupi tatt story [bear with me] <br/> 
 <br/> 
i was outta town last weekend. met up with some friends. there was this new girl in the old group.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
there was a 1/2 dollar sized maroon / red circle on her arm. look like a healing burn.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
after a while she said something about her  <strong>new tattoo</strong> . i immediately pipe up that i thought it were a scab... !!! i mean, she works in a kitchen! <br/> 
 <br/> 
uh.. she didn't pay attention to me the rest of the night. at all.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
turns out it was some fancy writing, like "Love is eternal, but it lasts forever".. just some stupid stoner shit. but it had all this cloudy flowery coloring around it, same color as the writing.. hence, it looks like a blob / scab from a distance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
lols on me! <br/> 
 <br/>
