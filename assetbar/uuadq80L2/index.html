      If debates had a Lame button, I'm sure they'd be used. Just because you don't appreciate something, doesn't mean the creator isn't talented. I don't like coconut. Never have. Even though I hate coconut, it would be incredibly lame for me to slag Pierre Hermé and his Macaron Haute-Couture, and if I were to do so, it would entirely appropriate for other people to press a Lame button if they had one.

      I like xkcd, sometimes. It is horrible inconsistent in being funny, but if you look at his earlier strips you see he isn't even trying to be funny sometimes. I think it's partially that he is just getting his weirdness out there, i.e. his tendency to apply science and math to real life. Some of us actually have that problem!

      It is a simple dream/wish fulfillment story followed by the events that triggered the wish fulfillment. I know there are a lot of weird Lynchian moments in the dream sequence, but it is a dream and the subconcious goes to town.

      No. <br/> 
Unconscious: Anything that you are not aware of.  This could involve desires and drives and memories.  You repress these things because they harm you.  According to Freud, your unconscious desires manifest themselves through dreams.  Collectively, all of your unconcsious desires and memories are known as your Unconscious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unconsciousness is also the state of not being aware of the environment around you, but this doesn't include sleep.  Sleep is an altered state of consciousness, because you are still aware (this is why you don't roll of your bed and why sensory imput is sometimes incorporated in dreams.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Subconscious: <br/> 
What is between your conscious and unconscious.  Pretty much this is whatever you are not currently unaware of, but can easily become conscious.  And example is a memory that you are not currently thinking, but you have no block preventing you from remembering it. <br/> 
This was renamed into the preconscious.  No one talks about it anymore because it is as boring as heck. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Both the unconscious and the preconscious involve the psyche.

      I've heard they're both the same, your definitions, and my definitions many times in my life.  As I understand it, Freud used "unconscious" to mean what we basically mean today as "subconscious."  So I'm sticking with my definition and if you can't figure it out, phooey. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I have a better idea.  Let's stop lecturing each other and all of assetbar right here and now and laugh at the pretty sequential art above.   <br/>

      I wasn't aware we were fighting.  I was just teaching you something that I know.  This is the terminology that psychologist use.  I figured you would have said "Oh!  I didn't know that.  Thank you for teaching me something new today, sje." <br/> 
But perhaps I have an unrealistic view of the world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, lay-people do say "subconscious" to mean what psychologists call the "unconscious", but we should refer to it as the unconscious instead because that was the original word that the professionals still use.  Also, it stops confusion.

      Now I'm fighting and stubborn.  I wasn't fighting with you, I was just saying that I have seen it in more places than one (or two or three) that it's the other way around, and I would gladly accept it if I saw it for myself.  I looked online between your first post and mine so that I wasn't putting my foot in my mouth and I saw on several sites that my way seemed to be correct (I said "seemed because I wasn't sure about the validity of them).  In keeping with that concern for validity, I didn't stumble over myself rushing to thank you, because I'm not sure what kind of source you are.  Like I said, I will accept valid proof. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I don't think it's really not worth either of our time.

      Why are you so mad at me?  Really, it's not a big deal.  I'm sorry if I seemed pedantic or anything, but I was just trying to teach people something I know about.  I mean, I'm a psych major, and I learn about these things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is really not a big deal that you use subconscious in that way.  It is an  <em>extremely</em>  common use of that word.  I see famous writers use it all the time.  But they are, by definition of every psychologist, wrong.   <br/> 
Look at this:  <br/>

Most of the people here say something that they think is the correct meaning, but most of them are wrong.  Until we get to John Hasznosi, who said it perfectly (about 5 posts down). <br/> 
But you want reliable sources.  Besides my psych teacher, this is what wikipedia has to say: <br/>

      The problem is is that some of us don't think you "know". <br/>

      Are you twelve?  Why are you so immature? <br/> 
I just said that I was trying to teach someone something.  This is precisely what my psychology teacher taught me, as well as all those sources said.  It is true that the word subconscious almost never appears in serious psychology articles/journals/whatever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And what were your sources again? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll ask my psych professor on Tuesday what the difference is.  He was a psychiatrist in the biggest mental hospitals in California, and teaches the subject for a living.  If anyone is a reliable source, it is he. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Saying "Burn" during a debate shows that you value winning competitions over knowing the truth.  It's quite a silly thing to say. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I am wrong, provide a reliable non-laity source that will show that I'm wrong.

      No, I honestly don't mind as much as you think I do.  I don't hate you, and the immaturity is me trying to introduce some humor to a tense "debate" (which I conceded to, I told you I accept your sources, that wasn't sarcasm).  You can go on thinking I'm sitting here, fuming and sputtering at the computer, but I'm not, the only thing that got my goat was when you just decided to teach me, and thinking I would love you for it.

It is of utmost importace to remember that words have many uses; jargon has very specific meaning outside the realm of common speech, but this isn't necessarily the only correct definition of a word.

Back to David Lynch, I also really enjoy  <em>Inland Empire</em> .  If people can't deal with  <em>Lost Highway</em>  or  <em>Mulholland Drive</em> , don't even try  <em>Inland Empire</em> .

      Ironically, I find David Lynch's best film to be the G-rated (!) and Disney-released (!!!!)  <em>A Straight Story</em> .  Wonderful movie that proves the point (to borrow a tired cliche) that it really is all about the journey, not the destination.

      What impressed me so much about  <em>Inland Empire</em>  was how radically he rethought his whole approach to directing based on the visual qualities of digital video (his first and only flick not shot on film- also the first he financed without any studio backing). I love the look of film grain & I do indulge in the ubiquitous movie hipster DV-bashing pretty often, but damn if the man didn't find the most beautiful qualities of that grainless seamless digital look. The extreme close-ups in that movie *kill*. I also really like how it teeters very close to some kind of coherent but incredibly complex meta-narrative, but every interpretation you come up with leaves out some loose ends. That could be said of most of his work since the 90's, I suppose, but then I'm one who likes  <em>Mulholland Drive</em>  (not crazy about  <em>Lost Highway</em> , though). His movies all seem to relate to dream states in one way or another to me, so I think it's more about symbolic meaning and dream logic than anything you can easily explain. People say that's a cop out, but I don't know any director who can conjure that state of mind more effectively. Hey, I have so many thoughts about David Lynch, I am clearly smart! I am a white male who went to college, so my opinions must be interesting!

      Jacob's Ladder had a nice idea and some good visuals, but it was predictable from the first scene. The title even telegraphed it. In this sense it is much like "The Sixth Sense" except the latter was absolutely terrible and pointless if you figured out the twist within the first five minutes.

      Yeah.  <em>Sixth Sense</em>  was painfully transparent. My only enjoyment (beyond the great atmospherics of it - it still had some great film-making in it!) was not ruining it for my wife, and getting a vicarious thrill at the "twist" ending from her amazement and surprise.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"What a twist!" (If you'll forgive a  <em>Robot Chicken</em>  reference.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
But  <em>Jacob's Ladder</em>  left me not quit sure until after the third viewing, and even now there's just enough loose ends left that I'm guessing.

I was saying that I find some of his work pretentious.  And the work I find pretentious are  <em>Eraserhead</em> , and those videos about those rabbits that are scary as heck, and a few other things I saw of his.  I mean the really surreal stuff.  I saw Blue Velvet, and I didn't hate it.  It was a good movie, def.  And this comic is pompous too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Okay, don't click on the link.  It's not a link to a page ranting about what a terrible man he is or anything.  It's from his site. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The comic is silly, as well as the belief that 9/11 was a conspiracy.  And most of his movies aren't silly.  (Although I have only seen Velvet Blue and parts of Eraserhead).

      just because something is surreal or hard to understand doesn't mean it's pretentious. there is a difference between pretension and true artistic vision. the easily intimidated often translate the latter as the former, but rarely do you find someone who has both.

      I should probably stop calling different types of artists pretentious, because that is not really a thing you can prove objectively, and it just gets people mad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't like Jackson Pollack either.  I find him pretentious as well.  But I bet someone here would defend him.  But I don't know too much about art/movies/poetry/etc.  So I'll just quit now.

      Dear sje46, <br/> 
 <br/> 
You have a high pretension meter because you are Achewood Phillipe. That pretensionless, perfectly sincere turn in most of your posts is what got you your stripes. Bringing up the pretentious-debate is what a board full of over cynical wankers needs. This wanker enjoys it. No quiting. Take the fight to the people. <br/>

      Son, I'm a little late to the party, but those "Angriest Dog" bits were hilarious. I may get lamed for saying it, but even though they are a peculiar sort of humour, they work! I can't imagine it having anything like the run of Achewood, but then I don't need a lot of taragon in a year to be glad to have had some. Thank you for sharing this with me. <br/>

      Of course I don't give all this  <em>commotion</em>  two shits in the afternoon, but I'll leave my opinion that xkcd is very good. I think his voice "humanizes" much of the geek themes he talks about, and he made some characters with more than a modicum of personality - and that's no small feat when you're basically drawing stick figures (the guy w/ the hat, for example).

      OK. I'll concede that XKCD is smug and self-satisfied.  However, it only by virtue of the link on XKCD's site that I discovered Achewood.  <br/>

      My friend showed my Achewood when I was still jerking off to MTTS, C&H and Dinosaur Comics (which I still like).  Needless to say, I literally cannot read most comics I find now.  For some reason, I was looking at QC (I know, I know, shut up, I was making a point) and there was a link to a comic called Ugly Hill that the "cartoonist" (I forget his name) said was great, and it was total shit.

      I think Ugly Hill is very different from those other comics--intelligent storylines & the artist really is an amazing character designer. In illustration, the guy is a king. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not everyone has to like everything, but it's hard to say it's "shit"--the character design really is quite impressive.

      He's got the drawing down pat-- very cartoony style indeed-- but it's pretty formulaic and since the only thing I've read webcomics-wise for the past year or so is Achewood, Dinosaur Comics and PFSC, that just doesn't cut it anymore.  Maybe the stories are smart (they're in the middle of an election-themed thing) and maybe some of the punchlines are funny, but since being exposed to Achewood, I can't read stuff like that anymore (Not that Achewood is like the apex of cutting-edge anti/meta/humor, but it sure not run of the mill).

      I think it's a little silly to assume that "many" other people here arrived via an XKCD link. I found out about it through some hateful nerd's blog. Joe Mathlete, I think his name was. I hated the blog, but somehow read it just long enough that day to get to the Achewood link. The rest is history. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, and since this seem to be the official "Tell Everyone How You Feel About XKCD" thread, let me say that I still hate it. Somehow, there was just never any question. The feeling was just so unambiguous, so  <em>pure.</em>   <br/>

      God damn, god damn, I slept late and missed a chance to force my opinion on everyone. I have a LOT of catching up to do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
...and GO! <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. I can't help but get the feeling that some people here think it makes them cool to hate everything on the Internet except for Achewood. Relax, guys, Onstad is not going to make you deputy hall monitor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. I am ambivalent regarding XKCD. 25% of it makes me laugh. Another 25% of the time I enjoy learning about the references. Yet another 25% of the time I wish he'd shut up with the references. And the final 25% is the inspirational/moralistic strips (like the furry one mentioned above) that are kind of self-righteous and grating. Still, the first 25% makes it worth it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. To say Dinosaur Comics is 'formulaic' is about the same thing as saying Achewood is about cats (see  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109185239/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_comics">Constrained Comics</a> ) <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. It's not about patting yourself on the back for understanding Wikipedia articles, it's about the way T-rex tries to apply the theories and reverts to childishness at the end of every argument. <br/> 
 <br/> 
4. Anything can be made to sound lame if broken down into a sarcastic description. I can easily do the same to Achewood (and have in previous comments), but there's no need for that right now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
5. Questionable Content is still unquestionably awful, and Octopus Pie is just not funny.

      By coincidence (and not to be confrontational or tit-for-tat), I just went and read dozens of Dinosaur Comics and I can't find a single amusing or interesting thing in that strip.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd come across it before (monitors wipe clean, y'know) and didn't see the point.  <br/> 
After a bunch of people recommended today, Ireally tried to stick with it an find  <em>something</em>  to like about it ... but no luck. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was a little mystified by the first Achewood strips I read, but it's compelling after just a brief skim, even is one doesn't quite get it right away. <br/>

No accounting for taste I guess.  <br/>

      So, I was going through this archive of 19th century newspapers, and they had these political cartoons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm picturing some old hayseed sittin' on the porch after a long hard day of shit labor in his dirty burlap pants and tatered straw hat, laughing his ass off at this funny or that through his last three good teeth.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Me? Did get half of 'em. Hadn't heard of most the folks or squabbles they were about.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
One brought a small chuckle: it was a depiction of Brigham Young's harem. Picture a room full of a dozen or so women dressed in to-the-ankle and to-the-wrist dresses, pulling each others hair and hitting each other with fists and pillows while Mr. Young cowers just out of shot in the doorway. I wasn't hella funny, but at least a chuckle. And that was it. I've had root canals that were funnier. <br/>

So, humor really is selective. If you don't get it, you don't get it. Doesn't mean anything. Just means it didn't work for you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't even have time for Achewood, so it is the only web comic I'm following. I envy those of you who have time to have an opinion on the rest.

      There are 12.  XKCD will present them in a 4x3 grid next week.  Opinion on the grid's comical merits will be sharply divided.  XKCD's creator, Randall Munroe, will make a T-shirt out of the panel, though, and the shirt's record-breaking sales will pay for his tuition at art school.  Armed with this new education, he will abandon the crude drawing style of the original XKCD for 3-D renderings of stick figures.  The next day's strip will consist solely of the rendering equation used for a stick-figure's hat.

      I'm pretty sure Ambien is a medicine, not a drug. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let's review: <br/> 
Valium: you can get a receipt when you buy it (medicine) <br/> 
Marijuana: no receipt (drug) <br/> 
Cocaine: no receipt (drug) <br/> 
Caffeine: receipt  (medicine) <br/> 
Robitussin: receipt (medicine) <br/> 
Alcohol: the bartender will probably smack you if you ask for a receipt (drug) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Based on the receipt criterion, Ambien appears to qualify as a medicine.

      Okay hedobot, but when you do it it's funny (at least sometimes). We're talking about a 43 year old man acting like a cat from a children's story with no ironic or humorous subtext. If it's not being a furry, it's at least somewhat creepy and nauseating.

It's only creepy and nauseating if that's what you make it. You could choose to make it silly and fun. Who knows, maybe even funny?  <br/>

At what age, exactly am I no longer allowed to make it fun? <br/>

      Well, judging from Tekende's post, I'm not the only one who thinks so. It seems more like you're trying to be cute than funny. I mean where's the joke? You're just mimicking cat noises and actions. I feel like Stewie when he went on Kids Say the Darndest Things and Cosby took his goggles and made skiing motions while making silly noises. "That's not funny! That's just saying what happens when you go skiing!"

      Ok. Got it. Frankly, most of this silliness is the direct result of watching my youngest cat's ways and reactions (he looks just like the avatar). If I'm eat'n tuna, he's all "someone say fish?", and just really present. And if I don't share, he's likely to get rude with the slippers. So, to that degree, right on, that's just what happens with a playful cat. But I find him funny as hell most days, so for me, playing him in human language  <em>is</em>  funny. But I totally get if it ain't for you.

Your correction is incorrect.  "Tripping balls" is a phrase that the Doogie Howser guy uttered in  <em>Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle</em> .  Which is funny, because whiteturtle posted something about  <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>  several hours later, but above loneal's comment, so it looks like she's picking up on the Neil Patrick Harris reference.  Anyway, I'm afraid you lost the culture wars this time.

Oh, I know what tripping balls means, I was "correcting" hedonismbot by making his surprisingly non-sexual post into a sexual post, but horribly so.  Stereo's version was much better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unless you're saying "tripping balls" is also a sexual term nowadays...I just know it as anothe way of sayin "high as fuck," but more related to an acid trip, right?

      dude ambien will fuck you up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
case in point: <br/> 
I was staying with my parents this summer (all the time waiting to get back up here to school), and I'd been prescribed ambien a few months prior when I began to sleep through classes to the point where I was unable to sleep unless it was classtime. But I digress. One night my mother comes in the room and asks me if I've taken my ambien that night, and I respond that I hadn't. She then tells me the following story: <br/> 
 <br/> 
The night before, she was lying in bed unable to sleep around 2am when she heard what sounded like someone pissing. On the carpet. In the hall outside of her room. She figured it was her 5year-old grandson that was staying with us at the time, and he'd just been unable to get to the bathroom. At that point, I walked into her room. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"What are you doing?" <br/> 
"I'm here." <br/> 
"Have you taken your ambien?" <br/> 
"yeah..." <br/> 
"Go to bed." <br/> 
"okay!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remembered NONE of this. Suffice it to say that I am no longer on ambien.

      Cool. I remember (sometime last century) waking my sister from an afternoon nap to have her ask me to put the lids back on the watermelons.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I said, "What?"  <br/> 
 <br/> 
She said, "Huh?"  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I said, "What watermelons?"  <br/>

She had no idea what I was on about. I wonder how that scene would play out on Ambien?

      I don't know why I feel like answering your unanswered question this late in the game, sje46, but the drug to which fuckyoufriday refers is in GTA III. It's a big pill that makes everything around you move...real...slooooowwww. If memory serves, I think there was one such pill just outside the police station, which was a recipe for hours of mindless, pig-slaughtering fun. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I always assumed that it was supposed to be PCP. That's what I eat when  <em>I'm</em>  slaughtering pigs, anyway.

      This is what it's like on the other side of existence.You kinda want some fourthmeal and you'd like to go to sleep coz you gotta get up early tomorrow. If you're on Ambien, you may be seeing double of things and rocking back and forth constantly. But that probably has nothing to do with the New World outside of me. We must forget our shame and our sorrow, our incontinent grandmothers and the squirrels we hit with our cars that didn't quite die immediately, all the things that held us back. Now, now we must go forth. There is a whole Hardon universe out there, and we haven't even begun to lightly stroke its balls.

The number of chuppies I would like to give you right now is about 17. Instead I'm going to give you one, so that I can save some for other people later in the day. If those other people don't work it today, the chubbus will go straight back to you. <br/>

      OH! I know this one: <br/> <br/> <br/> Last night I woke up... with the worst headache I've ever had in my life. And I... I went into the bathroom to get some aspirin... And I happened to look in the mirror... and... I swear to God, I see something I can't describe. But it sure as hell ain't my reflection. And then I hear this weird howl coming out of the sink. And there's a voice. It's a voice and it's saying: "Do not be afraid. Ninety-nine will die. Denver Nine".

      Unless it is a thing of South Korea to have hobo pack bonfires, I'm pretty sure it's the same one. It's on Shinan beach and it is indeed this weekend. My friend is in Gwangju. So I guess the upshot of all this is that I am encouraging you to approach her at this bonfire and let her know that I am indirectly stalking her via Facebook and a messageboard about cartoon cats. Yes, this seems to be the inevitable direction this exchange is headed in.

      Its a line by Crispin Glover as Cousin Dell in  <em>Wild at Heart</em> . Dell's mother discovers him in the kitchen at midnight with a 30cm chefs knife obsessively making sandwiches. She asks "Dell honey, what are you doing?" and with a look of frustration and anguish (as only Crispin Glover can do) he yells at her "I'm making my LUNCH!" while gripping the knife tightly. What is FEL?

      Dell really likes Christmas and screams when his mother tells him it is summer and christmas is six months away. The final scence in the little vignette featuring Crispin is him  <em>carefully</em>  placing a cockroach down his  y-fronts while standing bow-legged and gleefully shifting his weight from side to side, as Laura Dern's voice-over says "One day Aunt Ruth found Dell puting a cochroach on his anus".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
P.S. there is a big knife in the scene but I think I remember it differently now. I think he puts the knife down before smashing his sandwiches and screaming at his mother.

It's surprising how many people I know that are from former Soviet states.  Mind you, this would mainly be due to having been a wrestler in Australia for many years, where the sport isn't very big and pretty much everyone in the Olympic team is a European expat, and I was the only one in my club who could only speak English.  At least I knew when people weren't talking to me.

      As a scientist myself (and a biologist no less, but the wrong kind of biologist) I think I'll amend it to "I let some other scientists..." implying that perhaps this is just the sort of thing that happens at the lab after lunch when we're trying to avoid doing real work. <br/>

      The first time I read this, I was momentarily led to believe amid all of the food talk that 'onesie' and 'fire station' were obscure cooking terms that I would know if I read more of Anthony Bourdain's books.  I imagined a onesie was a small dish, suitable for serving some sort of side dish of bland roots and a fire station was a place where food was given a quick touch up on the grill prior to serving.

      assetbar_admin, if you're reading this, I have a humble suggestion: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Assetbar pages currently declare their character encoding to be UTF-8 but actually have their text encoded as ISO-8859-1.  That mismatch only leads to tears.  It's like opening a pint of ice cream and finding minestrone inside.  Minestrone is a fine and tasty soup; but when you've been promised ice cream, any soup is a letdown.  That's how my browser feels when you promise it UTF-8 and give it ISO-8859-1.

      Thanks tiger, god blessya.  I would never spam on my blog unsolicited, but I would love for people to read it and comment, and the Achewood folken are the people who would appreciate it most (outside of my friends and family).  If you gently mouse over my image, the url will appear.  I just re-kicked it off after maybe 2 years out of  commission and I am very excited about it.  The old novel I was working on is still in place, but I hit a narrative wall and anyone who can break on through to the next plot point would get a dedication in the published novel, fyi.

Until they see me on my recumbent, at which time they will realize that as long as someone like me rides one, they will never be cool or hip.  I will sense when they have this collective realization, and laugh my head off.  Unfortunately for me, I will be riding through East Palo Alto when this happens, and get mashed by a flatbed truck.  But I'll die happy that I thwarted those sons-of-bitches.  Well, until the pain hits.  And then I'll just go, "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggghhhh.  It hurts!  Pain!  Owowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowow.

      I am.  I'd guess the reason that the demographic skews so heavily towards engineers is that we have a high tolerance for looking dorky if we can also be *efficient*.  And often we don't end up more efficient, but we think we are.  So that's where it all falls apart.  I really like my recumbent, though-I wouldn't commute 30 miles a day on a road bike.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And yes, irondave, climbing does suck on a recumbent, but it's hard for me to tell how much more it sucks than on a diamond frame road bike because I sucked when climbing on a road bike, as well.  There are recumbent riders who swear that one can climb as well as a road bike on a 'bent, but I've never seen anyone demonstrate it, and the road bike-riding guy I somtimes ride in to work with smokes me up the Dumbarton bridge, which is a pretty mild climb.  'Course, he has a pretty nice road bike and I outweigh him by 60 lbs, so that'll do nicely as an excuse. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wonder if this is now the longest recumbent bike-related post in the history of Assetbar.  If so, I apologize.

      Indeed. The recumbent bicycle is primarily the transport medium of the eccentric, relatively hippieish university professor. Both liberal arts and hard sciences/maths are represented equally in this manner, but they have different reasons that drive them.

      Here's an old one (apologies if you've heard it before): <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, the pope was visiting New York City, and had a chauffer and limo pick him up at La Guardia. They had been driving into the city a short time, when the pontiff made an unusual request of his chauffer: He had always wanted to drive a big American car, like this limo. Would the chauffer mind letting him try it out? The chauffer's orders were to provide his holiness with whatever he desired, and so obliged. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, it was late at night, and the road was wide and clear, so the bishop of Rome really let it loose to see what the power of this car could do. It wasn't long before flashing lights and a siren brought this to an abrupt end.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
After searching a bit, the Vicar of Christ found the mechanism to roll down the window, and asked the cop what he could do for him.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Officer O'Mally hesitated a second, and then said, "I wanted to ask his Holiness for a blessing, and to request he blesses our city by abiding its speed limit." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"A blessing upon you and your city, my son." And with that, he was off again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
O'Mally returned to his squad car looking sooo perplexed. His partner looked at him, and said, "No ticket? What happened? Who was it?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
O'Mally, rubbed his forehead a moment, and said, "I don't know  <em>who</em>  it was. But he had the pope for a chauffer!"

"GQ" is played out.  Have a look at "Popular Mechanics" instead.  There will be information on guys who are the latest and also "handy around the house."  You don't want to risk a guy with more fashion sense than you.

      Re: $39 bottle of $6 wine <br/> 
 <br/> 
When a publican friend of mine was running a restaurant in his pub he had a fairly wide ranging wine list. There was a really nice bottle of Cabernet Merlot listed at $15 (Aussie dollars so cheapish at the time) it just wasn't moving so he  <em>raised</em>  the price to $21 and cleared his stock in a fortnight.

      When I first read this I accidentally followed the arrow to the left after reading the first breast panel... it actually made sense to me for the first few paragraphs until teodor popped up. I struggled for a few more panels thinking teodor was a metaphorical stand in for the lady until the logic was too twisted and I reaslized I was in error.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
However I don't think any of you can blame me for briefly thinking of teodor as a lady stand-in. I'm sure Molly does.

      Dear APERSON , <br/> 
 <br/> 
Our files indicate that you have expressed support for the Chubby Research Foundation. Therefore we would like to extend to you the opportunity to make a regular donation of one (1) chubby per calendar month to fund the Foundation's important work. On payment of your first chubby, you will receive a laminated membership card, a full-colour chubby fact-sheet, and, I don't know, some kind of keyfob or something. More importantly, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped ensure the ongoing cataloguing and categorisation of these rare and beautiful phenomena. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sincerely, <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Chubby Research Foundation <br/> 
(A Registered Charity) <br/> 
 <br/> 
P.S. As an incentive to join, here is a sample from our latest newsletter: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong><em>Did You Know</em></strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
You can search for "You gave this comment a chubby" to check how many you've handed out! <br/>

Until recently, Chubby Researchers believed that the chubby population had increased to 5 in every 200 comments. However, after a tour of Assetbar's most densely commented regions (including the 2100-comment "Kazenzakis Card Company"), it has been determined that chubbies are available at a rate of  <strong>5 chubbies for pages of 200 comments or less</strong>  and  <strong>10 chubbies for pages of over 200 comments</strong> !

the first one was rather pedestrian stuff.  <br/>

the 2nd one, i didn't understand some of the language (i ain't know them fancy cooking words).  <br/>

      Still, when I got to the panel with "I let some scientists chop off my dick last night. My mind is all over the place." I was done! It had been worth the other meanderings for this unexpected gem. Not only have I found the excuse for my next ten failures, I'm left asking the questions: "What scientists?" "Why do a thing?" "Why Ray's dick?" "Did they replace it with something?" "Are they going to?" <br/>

      Eh, very funny. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But seriously, a woman is an occasional pleasure, but a cigar is always a smoke. So why was I with her? She reminds me of you. In fact, she reminds me more of you than you do! Yeah, she got her looks from her father. He's a plastic surgeon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I chased her for two years only to discover that her tastes were exactly like mine: we were both crazy about girls. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But you know what I always say: Women should be obscene and not heard. And anyone who says he can see through women is missing a lot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm sorry if that offends, but I must confess, I was born at a very early age. And I've worked my way up from nothing to a state of extreme poverty. And when I die, make sure my agent gets one tenth of my ashes, as written in our contract. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, a black cat crossing your path signifies that the animal is going somewhere. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, if you quote me, quote me as saying I was mis-quoted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well I must be going. I have had a perfectly wonderful evening. This wasn't it. See ya' in the funnies.

Can we get clear that neither pro-choice nor pro-life camps are misogynist? While there is little agreement, both camps really honestly want what they feel most honors women. And the loudest voices on both sides are women. <br/>

      Au contraire, ma soeur! My willingness to sit it out comes with great intentionality - the kind that makes a difference.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really believe that something that impacts women so much more then men is something that should be exclusively theirs to decide. Period.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not passively sitting it out. I'm actively promoting men sitting down and women standing up. I'm actively supporting men, regardless of religion or public office, remaining neutral on this topic, and allowing the women to have an authentic conversation about what they want in this area. Only where Father's rights come into play should a dude have a voice in this matter. Otherwise, I thank men for shutting up and sitting down, and listening for what is there when only the gals talk. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It really doesn't fit your quote. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I take full responsibility for all men everywhere who think they really have anything to say on this, and I will not have succeeded in my intention until I (at that level) have sat it out and let the women sort it out amoung themselves. 'Kay?

      The difference is between intent and effect. We should agree that one can hold either position without the immediate intent being misogynistic. However, this doesn't prevent the other side from claiming that to hold such a position either a) involves some implicitly sexist assumptions or b) would infringe on women's rights through its desired ends. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do think that to place the argument there is a distraction, however; the central question is simply whether or not a fetus qualifies as sentient life. Presumably the whole issue should be laid to rest once we finally develop artificial wombs into which a fetus can be safely transplanted. I have a feeling this would still not appease some 'pro-lifers' though, and that is the point when you would know that the intent is controlling women rather than preserving life.

      Your points about controlling women are spot on, but even if a fetus  <em>were</em>  sentient life, I should not be legally required to donate my bodily resources to it, just as I am not legally required to donate blood or give a kidney to a relative. <br/>

      Well, I think the point that a sincere pro-life person would make is that it's not like the fetus comes out of nowhere and forces you to donate your body - the need for its support usually comes about as a result of certain decisions you and your partner make (the fact that the burden is only borne by one of the equally responsible partners is just one of the injustices of biology). Mind you, I'm not making this argument myself, just saying it's a valid point that could be made.

To stir the pot a bit: <br/> 
At what age of gestation (or beyond)  <strong>should you</strong>  be legally required to take care of the child/fetus?  Fertilisation, mid-second trimester, or is it once they leave the mother?  Or are we going by functioning personality - namely, when they're around 3 years old? <br/> <br/> <br/> Have fun deciding what makes you a person, fuckers!

      What's sad is that I had a full five page debate on the topic of abortion with a moderately intelligent pro-choice guy a while ago, and now I can seriously not be arsed to have one again. Although I realise that there isn't much call to, as most people are being considerate and trying not to fill up the comments section with futile bickering. (Not taking the subject of XKCD into account, of course.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Point being, the reason I really couldn't be bothered to go through it again is that I know at least generally how the two arguments will present themselves, and vaguely what impasse will be reached. It's like the science/religion debate. Neither side will change their opinion, because both sides have slightly but significantly different views on what is and isn't moral. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Although could someone clear up what the difference is between pro-life and pro-choice-but-of-the-belief-that-abortion-is-morally-wrong for me?

      That's an easy one. One is just a moral stance and the other is a moral and a political one. You can believe that abortion is morally wrong but know that this belief is based mainly on your religious views and thus should not be forced on others as law. You can also be aware of the fact that banning it would lead to backalley abortions and unwanted/abused children. In fact, many people who describe themselves as pro-choice actually feel this way.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, there are pro-choice people who do not think it's morally wrong because they do not believe in such things as souls and all scientific evidence shows that a fetus does not acquire consciousness (frontal lobe activity, ability to feel pain) until about the third trimester. So until then a fetus may as well be a sperm cell. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The point is that while there are two defensible moral stances that cannot be reconciled, there is only one defensible political one, as laws in a secular democratic society can only be based on scientific evidence rather than articles of faith.

      You know, thats a pretty good point, and I think I was off base using the word "misogynistic". <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Then again, though, the point is, I dont know what shes thinking. Ray's attitude is "She is touching her jewelry... now it is ok for me to impregnate her and expect her to kill my baby". <br/> 
 <br/> 
The whole point is that we dont know what shes thinking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do think youre right, that may not qualify as misogyny. But I still find it pretty disgusting, and disappointing from a character I otherwise like, which I guess is why Im angry about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I think youre wrong, I would still be pretty disappointed if she felt that way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It may be a "double standard", but only because there are TWO standards. Because there are DIFFERENT sexes. Ray is not ever going to have an abortion. If a girl decides that she is willing to risk having an abortion just to buck nasty with Ray, thats her choice. If Ray decides that the girl will just have to have an abortion if she gets pregnant, well, thats different. Different standards.

      Wow, I am clearly an amateur at this. Sorry about the double post. Also sorry about introducing a pretty unpopular debate, especially as a stranger in the midst of people who more or less "know" each other. <br/>

It wasnt my intention, I am not religious, so thats not what this is about. I guess I was frustrated reading my favorite comic and the punch line, rather than making me laugh, made me lose respect for the character.

      I agree with this using both hands.  Do not bring up feminism here.  Do not bring up abortion.  They will always trigger debates.  People will say they found some sort of consensus, then they will rehash the same argument next time.  Just say Ray's a douche, and we'll wink and nod.

      <strong>I agree with you </strong> chagment  <strong>but only to the point that your assumption may be correct;  You assume that ray is <em>not</em> assuming that the lady would <em>want</em> to have an abortion.  Perhaps he is assuming that the lady would in fact want to have an abortion if she got preggo.  And if she did want this, well then, more power to her and Ray.  If she doesn't, then of course she and Ray are both screwed (no pun intended) in so far as they now have a much more complicated situation than probably either of them was hoping for.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps in Achewood, there are no ladies who object to the concept of abortion.  Achewood is after all whatever the hell Onstead wants it to be, and maybe he simply doesn't think that abortion is a big deal, at least, on a philosophical / ethical level.  Obviously, it is still a medical procedure, and one that it's best to avoid if you can.. from a medical standpoint even the morning after pill is a little more involved and difficult treatment than getting a haircut.  But when it comes to ethical concerns, and possible psychological ramifications for the lady getting the abortion, some ladies simply don't have any problem with it at all.  None at all.  They don't think of it as killing a person in the least.  And so, maybe ray feels the same way, and so naturally hopes that his lady friend also feels the same way.  And like I said, maybe Acheworld is free of pro-life ninny extremists, in which case Ray's assumption would be much less naive than it would be in real life.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I welcome Loneal's contribution to any debate over abortion here.  I'm sure such a debate would be futile in the end, but I at least like to see a solid, rational, progressive, and well thought out point of view put out there for people to read.  After all, the pro-misogyny folks never hesitate to spam their insufferable cultism-infused extremist rhetoric at every opportunity, so it's nice to have a counter-balance, just in case there be impressionable young kids reading, or the like.</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>my personal theory on abortion is that there is no friggin way you can argue that a fetus is a human when the brain is less developed than a frog or a dog... don't get me wrong, I don't think that we should kill dogs, ever, but, if by chance I would need to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to raise that dog and spend all my time and energy on it and pay for that dog to go to college... fuck it.... hand me a 22 or a 38 or a damn axe for all I care... I'm gonna kill it quick before it does become human... and yet, even once a fetus actually does qualify as 'human,' ya know what, I'm still pro-choice, because you know, you gotta be pragmatic and recognize that as much as some might want this to be a black and white yes/no litmus test of life sort of question, it's not.  If we wanna talk about life, let's talk about the life of the woman (or often the girl) who is the mother, the impact on her entire life, let alone the very real, however small, risk of complications of pregnancy up to and including death...  It warms the heart that the pro-lifers are so ready and willing to force that risk onto women and girls...  Even if everything goes 'well,' the impact and cost to the mother and society as a whole is tremendous, and in a worst case scenario, you wind up with the mother having severe health problems, and, you wind up with a flipper baby.  Sounds like a win-win sitution.... </strong> NOT <strong><br/>
<br/>
This entire so-called </strong> pro-life philosophy <strong> is a scam that is the natural extension and tumerous out-growth of the </strong> extremist pseudo-Christian fanatical right-wing <strong> whose entire cultural perspective revolves around holding up misogyny and patriarchalism as sacred.  If these </strong> <em>hypocritical</em>   <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">dumb fucks</span> [b] really hold the life of a god damned single-celled zygote to be sacred, then why the hell is this the same camp of Red Necks that one generally finds at an NRA convention?  Where's the respect for animal rights?  No, these politically conservative bastards consistently fight for the right to use and abuse animals without limits, they fight against the most basic of human rights (health care, workers rights, etc,) but when it comes to a frickin amoebae fetus that is several billion cells short of being a human yet, all of a sudden these hypocritics conveniently become devout Buddhists. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So that's my perspective on the matter.  Thanks for listening everyone. :)

      you're talking about water balloons right?  You can make some insane water balloons with condoms.  Take them to the swimming pool and fill them up with the water jets on the sides of the pool, tie them shut and set them free...  If you play your cards right you can get the whole pool evacuated with a jelly-fish scare.  Especially if you use studded and ribbed condoms.  Good times , good times.

      I wish I could find a reference easily that explains the rationale for placing Red Panda in Procyonidae (the raccoon family) and the Giant Panda in Ursidae (the bear family).  None the less, it's a great illustration of the grading of closely-related families into each other.  Currently, the Giant Panda is considered the most archaic form of bear; presumably the Red Panda the most advanced form of raccoon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The bears are, in turn, the closest relative of the dogs (Canidae).  (Everything must ultimately be self-referential.) <br/>
