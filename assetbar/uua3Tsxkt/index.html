      I'm sorry, but you are wrong.  The lone apostrophe is used to make the possessive form of a plural noun, but a singular noun ending in s is still pluralized with 's.  As we are talking about one person named Beavis, and not more than one Beavi, the appropriate possessive form is Beavis's.  If you're going to correct someone and then end your post with an affirmation of your intellectual superiority, you need to ensure that you are right beforehand.  Failing to do so makes you look like a jackass.  Knowledge is power indeed.

      Okay, correction to both of you. It does vary according to the particular style. However, the most common usage, and the one I remember from my college newspaper days, is to follow the spoken form and add the extra letter if the original word ends in a soft "s" sound (Beavis's), and only the apostrophe if it ends with a "z" sound (Jones'). In any case, tipist seems to have taken his cunt pills today.

      Honestly, I thought the overuse of exclamation points and nonessential caps were enough to convey my sarcasm, but I guess I should've  made it a bit more obvious. I generally make it a point to NOT be a jackass/cunt in anyone's specific direction unless I feel that they deserve it (as I certainly deserve it on this occasion). Of course, I have no problems just being a jackass at random, that's just fun.

      Wow...you're a charming piece of work, aren't you? <br/> 
 <br/> 
And your grammar/spelling pedantry has FAILED.  the s' only applies to plurals.  See the link below: <br/> 
 <br/> 
https://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/possessives.htm <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're too lazy, here is the relevant bit: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Showing possession in English is a relatively easy matter (believe it or not). By adding an apostrophe and an s we can manage to transform most singular nouns into their possessive form: <br/> 
 <br/> 
the car's front seat  <br/> 
Charles's car  <br/> 
Bartkowski's book  <br/> 
a hard day's work <br/> 
Some writers will say that the -s after Charles' is not necessary and that adding only the apostrophe (Charles' car) will suffice to show possession. Consistency is the key here: if you choose not to add the -s after a noun that already ends in s, do so consistently throughout your text. William Strunk's Elements of Style recommends adding the 's. (In fact, oddly enough, it's Rule Number One in Strunk's "Elementary Rules of Usage.")" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I fail to be chastened.

      I missed his original apologyu, but I think now he and I have exchanged sufficient mutual apologies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is a nearly reflexive reaction to want to kick people who tell me "the more you know..." or "knowledge is power," or similar.  It makes me all grumpy. This would be why I jumped down the poor dude's gullet.  How could he have known he was pushing the DETONATE button? <br/>

Maybe I should apologise to you and everyone else who has stopped to read this overwhelming dicksmackery.

      I felt the same way, when I saw his original post, I didn't even look to see who it was that provoked my angry response.  If there's one thing I hate more than pedantry, it's erroneous pedantry, and I fully expect that if I make pedantic posts at any point in the future, someone will have the good sense to call me out on it.

      Mmm... <br/> 
I feel like participating here has shown me a lot more of the fine triple-line of information, party-style entertainment and actual conversation.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Assetbar is not any real tool or teacher to those who do not naturally converse in a funny or worthwhile tone. Honestly, it's one of the most hipster places I can think of.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe I'm wrong, but Achewood fans are an awkward bunch. Ever tried quoting this shit out of context? We all have and it sucks. Nobody laughs and you look like a fool and when you post it up here a few hours after, a couple people sympathize. So we take our inner angst and unleash it in ultra-ironic comments or scathing put-downs. And it's not like we're even that insensitive or oblivious to the effects of depression--anybody who can relate to Roast Beef's crippling anxiety or Teodor's ennui understands the effects of the real worlds blows.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know if I sound like an ass here, but this is a pretty dysfunctional goddamn community. I don't even know if I'd have it any other way, but I guess I'm just saying I wouldn't model my conversations after the shit I spew onto others here. So there's the long version of my answer.

      It's not the season of the year you were born in, it's the phase of baby-making. The Spring Sons (the left-hand column of lads, with the facial hair and baldness) are from the golden years of child birthing, the Summer Sons (Column on the right) are the next big batch, and so forth.

      I prefer this theory. You notice that the Spring Sons, born first and thusly more capable, are given the more complicated jobs, while the ones born later are delegated simpler tasks. Poor Taffy, the one they thought they got in just under the wire, his job is to stay out of the way.

It's through diligence and temperance that the Sanders had 17 children and were cursed but once each with a half-wit and a girl-child. You defy the natural order of the seasons and bring a babe forth into winter's cradle at your peril. They did their best to waylay Molly, conducting a right genocide of brook trout by the banks of the Cwmnantcol, but Taffy's the fault of their own weak flesh in the spring of 1760, not to mention a 100-year shortage of saltpeter.

      i checked. Finland beat out every other country, with 13 bands. Norway was second, with 12. I totally thought finland and norway were tied, but then I realized I had forgotten to count Nightwish. Canada came in fourth, with only five bands. Sweden was tied for fifth with the US, each with 4 bands. Germany and France were tied for sixth with 3 bands each, and Japan and Greece tied for seventh with two bands. The countries with one band each were Italy, Britain, Switzerland, Ireland, Brazil, Poland, Latvia and the Faroe Islands.

      That's a negatory.  They have a cord coming from the very bottom of a remote, which goes to the numchuk.   Holding it the oldschool way (which is never included in game-play with the numchuk attached) would put the cord coming out into the palm of your right hand.

      Negatory; PSP and DS use wireless multiplayer. Aside from the shouldery squareness evident, the strongest canidate would be the Wii Classic controller; it even has weird rectangular shapes on the back like the one in the strip, as evidenced here: https://cache.kotaku.com/assets/resources/2006/06/strangewiiclassiccontrollerslots.jpg <br/>

      I...I haven't seen the movie. [pause for gasps, confused chuckles] I've heard it highly recommended by Assetbar, I just haven't had the time. You can forgive me for not hearing of it earlier, as most of the people I know are the kinds who are more into "Mean Girls" than "Pulp Fiction", but it was my own fault for not making the time to see it after I heard about it here.  <em>Because I value your opinions!</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I couldn't find a way to make the zom-bee appear undead, othe than tinting it green, so in a fit of frustration, I gave it a lolcat caption and sent it on it's way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me. <br/>

      Seconded. Though the people catgrl are referring to probably miss the entire layer of irony and actually admire the main characters. <br/>

It's okay, catgrl, I still haven't seen Glengarry, though I feel like I don't even need to anymore, since pretty much the entire script has been quoted here at some point or other.

      Look, if there is grass on her hootenanny, she's probably some sort of zoophile, and will give you Mad Cow disease for eating her out or something.  I may have lost a metaphor up there, but banging a girl with grass on her field is how AIDS got started.

      It's extremely unlikely they're Catholics - Catholicism was a very marginal sect in Wales at the time of Molly's birth.  And those big hats imply they're members of a puritan church, which means protestantism (and dislike of Saints, at least on the Catholic model)

      St Andrew is the Patron Saint of Scotland, so many Presbyterian churches are named after him. As the Presbyterian church is Calvanist in theology we must judge this In answer to the earlier question, some Protestant denominations, for example Anglicanism, recognize Saints, but no mainstream denomination claims the ability to canonize. We must therefore assume that St Hoppy  was in fact one of the very few Catholic or Orthodox Christians present in Wales at the time of his death. Or this is just a cartoon about a cat. Whatever.

      I've met The Man and he's nicer than you'd think.  Clean nails, good suit, and his teeth aren't as white as you'd think.  You can barely tell he has semi-congealed evil throbbing in his veins.  The man knows Scotch.  He actually was a Presby in his youth, before he became an activist in his 20s.  Of course, after he finished his Ivy League time, knocked up a lower class girl then married a wealthy Junior Leaguer, and got that nice house, he was different.  He gave up on his liberalism, got invested, became Episcopalian, got into Genesis, and met people like me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I'm saying loneal, is that you are on a path to become The Man.  Look into your quivering female heart, you know this to be true.  You cannot fight this loneal, it is your  <em>destiny</em> .

      The greater part of Teodor's menu could have been prepared ahead of time. Really he should only need to stick the beef wellington into the oven and pour ranch dressing onto the chopped lettuce. I speak, of course, with the broad confidence of someone who has never had to cater a wedding.

      He could probably do a bit beforehand, but a lot needs to be done day-of, or nearly to order with some things.  The salad can't be cleaned and chopped til about an hour before.  The rarebit obviously needs the cheese prepped a few hours before at most.  The wellington can't have it's duxelle made til day of, though the pastry part can be done early and frozen.  Beans can simmer all day if he's slow cooking them, but the spuds can't sit around that long.  The stew is best made the day before, and just reheated, so that's an easy one.  The cheese puffs absolutely must be served straight from the oven though, which is rough. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All and all this isn't the world's best catering menu.  I still hold it's a good meal, but trying to pop out gougeres for a hundred is almost impossible on it's own.

      In my experience the topping for rarebit can sit in the fridge for days before consumption. I also don't see why you have to make the duxelle fresh, though I speak from no experience. I'll take your point on the salad. I have no sense of lettuce.

      Duxelle tends to weep liquid as it sits, even if you don't season it til you use it.  I will admit my rarebit experience is making it twice (didn't much like it), so I'll defer to you on that.  In my mind the killer is searing off, coating, and wrapping a buttload of filets, then piping and baking the puffs.  I'm sure he can make the pate a choux previous day, but piping a zillion little puff and baking them correctly takes both speed, and about 40 ovens.

      I would like you more if you owned an adult goods store.  Mostly because they are hilarious.  Everyone tends toward the freaky S&M stuff, the gigantic 14 inch dildongs, and the completely embarassing 'male toys' composed of awfully painted plastic masks over inflatable bodies attached to pieces of silcone with a hole cut in them.  They cost 20, 50 and 400 dollars respectively.  Further I giggle my ass off at the odea of women holding up a hundred dollar contraption with fourteen moving parts and trying to please themselves with it.  I've asked, and it seems the by far best sellers are the tiny little wigglers that take a AAA and cost 5 bucks.  And yet there is this huge store full of crazy shit to wow the newbies.  Oh how I wish you owned this store.

      I may have mentioned this before, but I had a good friend who worked at a sex store in high school. In Texas. And not only did she sell all that stuff, but she had to refer to vibrators as "personal massagers" and dildos as "cake toppers" because Texas is dumb and thinks that-- I don't know-- if we ladies get an assisted orgasm we might not need the menfolk? I don't really know. But her time there led to many, many wonderful stories.

      This is what happens when you address it, reference it, or acknowledge it in any way. Contrary to what some said previously, someone who would lash out at a 17-year old girl like that really does not deserve to be called by a human pronoun. Just pretend it's a piece of malicious code rather than a deranged manbaby with self-control issues.

      I'm not stalking you, whoever you are.  So getting your age right in this fake profile isn't a consideration.  I just make copycat profiles sometimes.  Today turned out to be your turn.  no pun intended. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So you're only 14?  Well one possible response to your relatively young age is that the humor on here is perhaps a little adult for a 14 year old, but such a concept sort of is condescending, because it assumes that a 14 year old lacks the sophistication necessary to get the nuance and irony of the humor and to see through the whacked out ego of the average adult.  Don't get me wrong, it does appear that you do lack sophistication, but hey, why look at it as a liability, and why not instead take an optimistic view:  You're precocious.  You're already at the level of people like achilleshell.

      I was kidding about that, in case you didn't get that. I think we're all fully aware of your profile-making habit and your bad case of the need-hugs-badly-oh-god-I'm-so-lonely.

      I saw a swastika on an antique postcard my family had in the attic. <br/> 
It claimed to be a symbol for four L's, that stood for good things, like "Light, Love, Luck and Laughter" or something of the sort... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, my family is 99.9% German (so German we float), so that might have just been a pleasantly-coded postcard signifying that "auntie minnie has killed again"...  *shiver*

      Truth.  They stole the symbol from India.  It is a Hindu symbol that loosely translates to "well-being or goodness".  In Sanskrit and into the Hindi language the term "Swastihe" is used as a greeting in the manner of "How are you?  Are you well?"  Interestingly, the swastika shows up in many ancient cultures around the world.  In their art, crafts, architecture, and used in different kinds of ceremonies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hitler was fascinated with India and it's culture and adopted the Swastika as the symbol for his Nazi party, albeit in a corrupted form.  He also adopted and corrupted the term Aryan and applied it in a manner to define the master race/ blond haired, blue eyed perfect human specimen idea.  The term Aryan actually is used to describe a person who is noble and just, someone to be looked-up to regardless of race. <br/>

      The root word of Aryan is Arya.  In short it is rooted in the Vedic word for God which is Hari, or the people of Hari known as Hariya. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also related to the German word "Ehre" meaning to honor, which is where the term "Herr" for Mr./Master comes from.  Iran, Eire (Ireland) and the Ari in Aristocrat are all rooted in the word Arya.  The direct meaning from the Sanskrit means Noble.  Alii or Arii in Polynesian dialects is also the same word and means chief or noble.  The founders of the Inca civilization were called Ayar.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
All of these groups have a strong relationship to the Sun, thus the Solar emblem of the swastika which also represents time ever moving forward like a wheel.  The swastika is a disc symbol with the four legs symbolizing movement. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The disc is also the ancient symbol of God and the red lotus or red rose represented the Goddess.  Ancient sculptures with the disc or lotus emblem refer to the God Hari and Goddess Hare.  Haryans were so called because of their harmonic connection with God/Goddess  and the divine. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the ancient region of Iraq they were called Hurrians, also known as Mittani and they left many pure Sanskrit writings available to this day.  The royal dynasties of Egypt married Hurrians.  King Tut's mother, grandmother and other ancestors were all Hurrians, Haryans, or Aryans if you will. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So not only is the swastika seen throughout the ancient world, but also the term Arya/Aryan was used in many cultures to define nobility, respectability, virtue and righteousness.  Had Hitler recognized the true meaning of Aryan he would have had to admit that each culture has its own Aryan people, and that it has nothing to do with race, color, or creed.

      Actually, Hitler knew quite a bit.  Germany got screwed after WWI and he brought about an economic reform that was really quite extraordinary.  I'm not saying that Hitler was cool in any way, but most people who get into positions of power are very knowledgeable.  Whether they use their knowledge for the good of humankind or corrupt information to promote their own twisted agenda is the differential factor.

      "Actually, Hitler knew quite a bit." <br/> 
 <br/> 
True, but his knowledge was more about how to manipulate people than about the actual culture he mythologized.  I mean, he would have been totally aware that he was just making up history and twisting the truth, but that doesn't necessarily mean he knew the actual history of the groups that called themselves  the Aryans.

      When I was in Austria I visited the home where Hitler was born because I happened to be traveling through that town.  I had expected it to be a fairly obvious place, maybe on a tourist map, a marker on the building, etc.  Instead, I drove past it about ten times before I found it.  It was a crumbling old building located on a street of nicely renovated flats.  There was a big stone on the sidewalk in front that said "Hitler's birth home" or something to that effect.  Now it's like an old folks home. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I didn't mean to start a whole conversation about Hitler and history, right and wrong, good and bad, I just wanted to point out the origins of the swastika symbol.  There are so many good things that are taken and used for bad purposes that eventually the original good thing is only seen in it's corrupted form.  As a person who is intrigued by perspective and how a particular perspective on aspects of history affect the present and future, I thought I'd clarify that little tidbit about the swastika since no one else had.

      It was actually due to a whole lot of Hitler being retarded and not understanding history (like we didn't know that). While Germany was indeed once ruled by Arians, it was not ruled by Aryans. The Arians were a sect of christianity that believed that while Jesus was Christ, he was not one in the same with God and the Holy Ghost. Eventually, Trinitarianism won out and christianity is as we know it today. They may have believed they were right, but I don't think they ever saw themselves as a master race.

      Bags in similar in function to the verb call. for example in the US you would say "I call shotgun" thus staking a claim of the front seat of the auto, in other English speaking countries you would say "I bags the front seat". Also acceptable is "Baggsie" or "Dibs" as in "Dibs on the front seat".

When the first one goes off you snarf the pills and sink back in the golden arms of etc. Then the second one goes off and you have to get up to turn it off; in addition your body is now flooded with caffeine and you are busting for the lavatory.

      If he hadn't spent all night planning he'd have been able to get up in the morning and wing it.  And then, having pulled an all-nighter, he fell to the classic mistake: "Ah, I'll just get a quick bit of sleep, then get up feeling nice and refreshed."  THAT NEVER WORKS! <br/> 
 <br/> 
What a dumbass.  He'd better give that check back.

      I think Lloyd was actually saying "gigawatt".  <br/> 
If you think about the pronunciation of "gin" or "gist", you realize there  <em>seems</em>  to be at least  <em>some</em>  precedent for starting with the soft "g".   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But there's also "Gideon", "ginkgo", "git", "give" in support of the typical pronunciation of GB with two hard "g"s... <br/>

In 1984/5 I doubt computers with a gigabyte of anything were available on the mass market. So it probably wasn't typical yet.

Sorry, a Watt is a unit of  <em>rate</em>  of energy - you can be, at some particular point in time, be using a Gigawatt of power, but if you want to talk about the total energy used in a day, you would have to talk in units of Watt-Hours...

      I am down with the Joule...  But it's not commonly used when talking about electrical energy consumption (not in my experience anyway).  It'd be like talking about highway speeds in terms of meters per second - perfectly accurate, but less useful 'cause it's not one of the two scales people normally expect, and most people aren't up for the kind of mental arithmetic involved in conversion.

Interestingly enough, victuals is pronounced like "vittles."  (OK, I didn't know that maybe everyone else did.)  However, the earliest reference in writing is from the 14th century:  <em>And Olyfauntz &amp; ek Camayles, Bothe hij charged with vitailes.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
The earliest similarity I could find (with the help of the OED of course) is from 1523:  <em>As for victuaylys in our waye we shuld be sure none to fynde</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Interestingly, in the American South (allegedly) it is spelt like it was ~700 years ago. <br/>

      If I were the ruler of some forgotten monarchy in a dank castle, I would totally have a guy to just sit in the middle of the courtyard, and waiting for people to show up and shout "What news from the north!" or whatever cardinal direction people are coming from. But his job would not be to relay this information or do anything practical with it. Just to have him there, looking all official in his garb and his hair combed just right, collecting the information or even not paying attention to what anyone says is just fine, lettin his smug smile grow wider and wider by the day. This would serve my purposes because whenever messengers would show up he would intercept them with his shouting and they would tell him what the dealio is and then leave, thinking their mission to be done. So basically my dude would be like my medieval version of the internet: where information goes to die. Then as king I would always be able to sleep in and fuck wenches uninterrupted.

      That is, until both your castle and your wenches were invaded by the barbaric hordes from the north, the news of which would never have reached you. <br/>

Speaking of which, I swore never to get into another MMO, but I recently watched the trailer for Age of Conan. There is a part where King Conan is listening to one of his messengers while he ponders over a map of his kingdom that is held down with a dagger and a goblet of red wine. Then when he hears of the coming invasion (the news from the north, if you will), he slams his fist down onto the table, spilling the wine, and the camera zooms in on the wine-stained map, which gradually fades into a blood-stained battlefield, at which point the camera zooms out again. It was even better than I imagined the intro to Trials of Honour to be.

      The falcon licks higher and higher on his muscled thigh.  Conan felt anxious about this, but it felt right.  "That's cool" the mighty warrior said, and felt his bronze pecs bulging.  The falcon closed it's eyes and licked higher, higher and higher, finding a gap in Conan's loincloth.  His advisers looked on in awe, and his massive battleaxe swung free...

      If you click on "Why a Flat Earth", you can read some really entertaining stuff.  I don't think that this is actually the Flat Earth Society's website, based on the disclaimer at the bottom of the homepage, but it is hilarious nonetheless.  As you move further through the page, you get gems like this one <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once again, picture in your mind a round world. Now imagine that there are two people on this world, one at each pole. For the person at the top of the world, (the North Pole), gravity is pulling him down, towards the South Pole. But for the person at the South Pole, shouldn't gravity pull him down as well? What keeps our person at the South Pole from falling completely off the face of the "globe"? <br/> 
 <br/> 
and this one <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now imagine, if only for the sake of argument, that the person on top and the person on bottom can both manage to remain attracted to the ground "below" them. What would happen if the person on one side decided to visit the other? Since the man at the North Pole has a different idea of what is down and up (and in fact experiences an opposite pull from the Earth's gravity) than the person at the South Pole does, when the denizen of the frozen Arctic visits his Antarctic counterpart, they will experience gravitational pulls exactly opposite of each other! The human from the North Pole will "fall up", never returning to the ground, and will continue falling forever into the deep void of outer space! <br/>

      I found this line in the New Yorker post pleasing, in a David Byrne kind of way:   <br/> 
"You can never go home again, but you can identify what it was that you liked about your home and maintain those presences in your current life in a way that achieves an almost totally satisfying approximation." <br/>

      Pretty close I guess, two seperate Yiddish speakers explained it to me that way (with the soup). It may have been a metaphor but I think it is good one. I may have the terms backwards, but Ray is a soup spiller, and Beef is a soup spillee.

      A shlemiel is someone who is kind of an idiot, often in a silly way, and a shlemazel is someone who just has no luck. ("Mazal/mazel" means luck, so I'm guessing "Shle" as a prefix means without, and "meil" means mind or brain. Makes sense to me, my knowledge of Yiddish stretches only so far.)

      Yiddish is just German spelled incorrectly, plus a few slang words. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As the quintessential example, if you said the German word for "Jewish" - Juedisch - out loud, it would sound almost exactly like "Yiddish." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I get really annoyed when people write that such-and-such is a Yiddish word, when all it is is a German word that looks like it was spelled by a native English speaker. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said, shlemiel, shlemazal seem like part of the 5% that's actually unique.  And I acknowledge that SOME yiddish words actually have some Hebrew origin. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would note that "Schlecht" means something like "bad," so the prefix "shle" probably means "bad" as opposed to "without."

      Are shlemiel and shlemazel from Hebrew? I mean, "mazel" certainly is, but if, as catgrl says, shlemiel means "without a brain," it seems pretty different from the Hebrew "bli moach." Maybe not that different. I don't really know what I'm talking about.

      To be a complete dick about terms, does the insertion of a hyphen constitute misspelling?  Or is it mispunctuation, i.e., and "typo"? <br/>

      In the state I live in, one can roger 16-year olds with near impunity.  I know there is one state where it's 15, and two at 14.  Unfortunately there is an Act that states you cannot transport a person across state lines for fucking, oddly known as the Man(n) Act.  So if the delicate children of Assetbar are not in the same state as the pervy old men, and if that state isn't in the short list of fun ones, the pervs are out of luck.

      I think by linking generically to that page he showed us that the interview was new and hot and fresh, on top of all of the other stuff. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In fact, scrolling to the bottom I note that the "Cartoon Lounge" is a relatively embarked ship. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But your link will obviously be superior once there is a new article/post at the top of the page. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Although I wouldn't mind if the people of the future who are going through the archives try to click on that link and get some random snark about Dilbert or something.  Who cares about the people of the future?  We are walking around in their past and  <em>they don't even care</em> .
