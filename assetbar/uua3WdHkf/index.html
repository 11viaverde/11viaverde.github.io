      What was the secret behind their getting people to not only want to watch basically an improv team picking random phrases out of a hat and acting out what's on them for seven years straight, but want to <i>tell me about it at length with no provocation all the goddamn time</i>

      If you want to watch a show that both fucks up the X-Files  <em>and</em>  is made by J.J. Abrams, I recommend Fringe.  John Noble is hilarious in certain episodes!

      At the small town Denny's I frequented when I was a teenager, there was a guy who worked in the kitchen who loved the band Suicidal Tendencies. He always wore a ball cap with the bill flipped up so you could see that the word "SUICIDAL" had been screen printed there. On his arm was tattooed the creed "SUICIDAL FOR LIFE." He also spoke those words regularly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I went back to that small town last Summer and visited that old haunt for the first time in a decade. The place was unrecognizable. The brown and yellow walls were now bright white and the enormous piece of yarn art had been taken down from its place over what had been "our" booth. But he was still there wearing his funny hat. "Suicidal for life," he said.

      One night when I was probably about 22, I was really fucking wrecked and I went to my local Denny's establishment. There was a wait, because there's not much to do at 2am on a Saturday night in New Hampshire  other than go to Denny's. At the table closest to the line, there were two boys who were probably about 18. They started talking to my friend and I, and we eventually sat down. They bought us Denny's foods and coffees and we sat and laughed and giggled and flirted and had a grand old time. Then those boys left and I never saw them again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, I don't think I ever saw them again. I was drunk as fuck and I don't remember that night at  <em>all.</em>  My friend told me about it the next morning while I was puking in her bathroom.

      Too bad.  Your chances for reckless abandon diminish exponentially with each additional year. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At 18 getting drunk with a felonious Denny's waitress is the fodder for a lifetime of wistful remembrance.  At 35, you're just pathetic.

      (Mine's not that good. Sorry.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I was 17 years old and a softhearted vegetarian, I went to Denny's with my mother and a family friend. I ordered some sort of chicken-salad that had things other than chicken in it. All I said was, "________ salad with no chicken please!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
When the food was put upon the table, all there was was a bunch of greens. When the waitress got back to refill drinks/check up on the quality of the food, I shyly-and-politely informed her that there were OTHER things in that salad, all I requested was that the meat be removed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Her retort? "Well, who can you remember what you vegetarians will eat anyways?" To this day I can't figure out if she did it on purpose because of some weird-ass vendetta against diets other than omnivorism, or if she fucked up and tried to blame it on the oh-so-confusing concept of not eating meat.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's freakin' Minnesota man, and not even a farm-community type place. A suburb, just a dozen minutes from the Twin Cities. Vegetarianism was not a new fuckin' concept.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, that's my only Denny's story. Haven't chilled out there since. Turns out there's food out there that doesn't taste like shit.

      Dearest Rat,  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Please be advised that "anal" is an adjective.  You probably mean "anus."  Better yet, consider using the term "rectum."  <br/>

      So, naked bear and a naked cat with a gleeful expression on his face walk into a Denny's. <br/> 
The waitress asks them <br/> 
"hey, what happened to all of your clothes? You can't just walk in here buck naked!" <br/> 
So, everyone at the restaurant is just staring at them slack-jawed in shock. <br/> 
The bear subtly holds up his paws in a 'stop' kind of gesture, widens his eyes at them and mouths the word "seriously" through his teeth while pointing at the cat with his eyes swiftly and then looking back at them. <br/> 
One of the customers nervously laughs, and the cat swiftly flicks his head toward the bear, catching his attempted message to the people. The bear quickly puts on a goofy smile and acts like he was doing jazz hands in an attempt to cover it. The cat's grin goes flat and his eyes widen to enormous black voids as he slowly turns his head back toward the interior of the restaurant. <br/> 
Here are some of their hands.
