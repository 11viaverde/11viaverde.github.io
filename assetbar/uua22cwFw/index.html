      it's like the ultimate solution to agoraphobia, although would be better if it was tinted glass.  I think the only way it could be even better is if he could put Ray's pool house on wheels and move it over onto the field.

I just figured, Beef being the way he is, that he reckoned he'd get hit by a lot of "slow pitch softballs" which turned out be rather harder and faster than advertised.

      WHAT?  How dare you even make that insinuation before building a complete frame of reference???  If you check my blog post from August 15th, 2002, it clearly states that the nickname "'stad" is an artifact from my stuttering days.  The post can be found just below the description of my current mood (rambunctious) and just above the posted results of a suprising test revealing that my personality most closely matches that of Sailor Mercury.  If you can't even do some basic research, I hardly want to talk to you.

      Chubbied because I also have a friend who is a furry etcetera etcetera. He gave me a flash drive of hentai, without my even asking for it, and the majority of it was furry. And then he pestered me to give it a chance. I did. I think my experience is worse than yours.

      He's just mad because when he and all the other poopypants formed an Achewood messageboard, after Chris put the ax to the old one, Onstad didn't care and even thought they were a bunch of dinks. Now Chris has stolen their little secret thunder by bringing back a messageboard and they are pouting about it and trying to be annoying (and succeeding). Asherdan I seriously doubt Onstad will start killing posts like the old days, so you should probably just stop trying to be a turd sandwich.

      It has to do with history.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
When a webcomic first starts out, you remember the good ones and forget about the bad ones - so, for instance, you remember "Not Afraid of the Fucking Police" and don't remember, say, the one where Chris couldn't think of an ending and said so.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As time goes on, and the archive builds up, new comics are measured against the highs rather than against the comic strip as a whole.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Gabe explained it one time on Penny Arcade; I thought that it neatly explained why comic strips seemingly drop in quality. I think that this is a little light for Achewood - stoned is kinda funny, but not particularly memorable - but I don't mind. There'll be better ones coming.

      Actually, the one where Lyle announces that there will be no ending because the cartoonist couldn't think one up is one of the funniest ones, in my opinon. But yeah, I agree with the gist of this.

      I don't trust the alt text for this strip. Ray sounded like he was surprised. My thought is that he had a number of possible resolutions in mind for this situation and 'plexiglass dome with baby-incubator hands', while certainly *on the table* was not what he was expecting. Probably because he was so stoned.

      Softball is like baseball except you use a bigger ball. The idea is it's harder to hit a softball as far as a baseball, so it's easier for people to field. Also since the ball is bigger (and the ball therefore will move slower), it's less likely that someone will get hurt by a ball clocking a dude upside the head. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Slow-pitch softball is just softball, but the pitcher is not allowed to throw the pitch over his sholder. He can only pitch "underhand" with a predictable arc. In addition, slow-pitch softball uses an even bigger ball with longer pitching distances than "fastpitch" softball (where maximum-speed pitches are allowed). The idea with "slow pitch" is that it allows more offense in the game, so that even people like you and me that can't play baseball to save our lives can still get a hit now and then.

      Just because the space inside is bigger than the space outside doesn't mean the arms aren't inside the box. <br/> 
Also, sorry, but a waldo is a remote manipulator, as in radio controlled, not just a fancy glove. I think it comes from such as a sci-fi story by Asimov.

      I apologize for my ignorance. Heinlein, and the glove things are  included in the definition of "waldo". At least, the ones for dealing with radioactive stuff are, because typically, they aren't just gloves, the hands are controlled indirectly.

      This strip is OK. Chris, do you really want to open this pandora's box further? (It was opened a crack before so only smaller things escaped, but now the larger things can join them in the helter skelter.) Instant feedback on your strips will make writing comics like doing stand-up before a crowd that will chuck tomatoes at you before you even finish a joke. The only thing that will satisfy them is continuous slapstick on loop and repeat.
