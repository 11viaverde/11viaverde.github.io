      The Pepsi-can lamp on the phonebook nightstand littered with condom trash...classic. I love how Ray's abalone deal is all channeling Henry Hill from Goodfellas, all paranoid and glancing up at the black helicopters in the sky and neurotically wiping his nose.

      The cops always strike when you're trying to cook a fancy meal. I swear to God, it's like telemarketers when you  <em>sit down</em>  to have a nice meal.  <br/>

Imagine that double-team. Dad gets busted as a coke mule while he's trying to sear up some pork shoulder, and then while everyone's trying to cope and they try and slice one little bit off with a trembling knife some nasal, twangy fuck calls asking if you want to change your long-distance plan.

      Today. Today is the day I  <em>finally</em>  understood the last panel. I had always taken it as Ray being worried that the grill was going to explode and possibly shoot a fireball high enough to hit the helicopter. I think I had never realized that the word abalone was in there and that abalone is a type of bird. Man. I feel so dumb, and yet so smart at the same time.

      It's not a bird, it's a type of sea snail that was heavily overhunted since it's delicious. California has hell of restrictions on catching any, let alone selling it.

      Essentially Ray is cooking illegal dinner and a therefore a little jumpy about the eye in the sky.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The strip following this one cuts to an aerial view such as one might enjoy from a helicopter looking down on Ray's estate (see panel three, next page) so at first I thought this was going to be a whole thing, but then it never materialized.

      Ray in this comic is like a friend of mine. Dude would always call when my girlfriend and I were about to be getting mad rutty. These phone calls always went like this : "Hey man what´re you doing?" <br/> 
"Well my girlfriend´s over, and..." <br/> 
"That´s cool. Why don´t you come here? We could watch a dvd and stuff. Would be fun" <br/> 
"I much rather would not..." <br/> 
"Ah come on. Don´t be a dick"
