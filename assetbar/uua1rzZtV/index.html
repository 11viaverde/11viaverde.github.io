      It implies that Chris Onstad plays fast and loose with the concept of hair on already hairy creatures, to great effect. <br/>

      hear, hear! I loved the use of human style hair in previous strips evolving from the core idea of plain cats (except for glasses, medalions, underpants, and walking upright) in future and past scenarios to differentiate from the present. <br/>

      AS far as I'm concerned a chronicle of Ray telling ultra-depressed Beef about people getting shot in the head (as a depressive I can tell you that that is a really depressing thought, because you immediately wonder what that experience would be like to morbid extremes) throughout their entire lives is really damn funny and extremely representative of two well-crafter characters.  That this is so when one of the characters never has a line just adds to the awesomeness/humor.

      so you don't think it's funny to worry that your best friend will change as a result of getting married...because then you won't have anybody to tell about stuff getting shot in the head? <br/> 
 <br/> 
it's too bad (but not a surprise) that the strips with more conventional humor--either jokes about smoking pot or drinking, or cutesy stuff with phillipe, or ray butchering west-coast slang, also some of the "macho" humor like the great outdoor fight and the badass games and the "ha ha that dude is crazy" humor involving nice pete--get higher scores, but the pre-2003 strips that are more surprising in their format get much lower ratings, and plenty of confused or negative comments. i am very happy with the "delete this forum" idea, because many of the loudest people on this comment forum are the ones who have the most standard, webcomicky tastes, and i really hope chris onstad isn't trying to cater to people's tastes by looking at these scores; i get that he's got to make a living, but the earlier, less predictable strips were really something special, and the more recent, more highly-praised-on-this-forum strips are more like other webcomics, just better-written.

      I give out many fives, but I also only vote on a fraction of the strips I view; basically, I generally don't bother to rate strips I don't feel highly about.  But still, while there are a number of strips I think are overrated or just mediocre, I can't think of any off hand that really deserve a 1 (which, even rating them only against other achewood strips, still seems to say "this fucking sucks," and I guess I've never felt that strongly against any achewood strip).  That's why I like achewood, even the half-assed strips normally have one decent, if not almost redeeming, feature.

      What?? Surely this one makes a straightforward, traditional-sense joke. I've always interpreted it in this way: Ray is sincerely hoping that the status quo will not change, without realising just how horrible and traumatic that status quo has been for his friend.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Queue laughter. Seriously. Also, there's the distant implication that Ray has conditioned Beef to think of suicide as a way out of things, just as Beef is getting into something, something big...

Why the 'shot in the head' theme?  I'm guessing it's because Kurt Cobain's suicide has been cited as a life-changing moment for an entire generation, but here it's an after-dinner mint to Beef's powdered eggs-and-scrapple adolescence.

      I was wondering about that too... Of course, there are two pillows there, and while that by itself might mean nothing, the angle seems to make the bed look smaller. I bet it's at least a double, possibly a queen, although I always thought Ray was the kind of dude who rolled with king size only.

      I think this is basically an illustration of the fact that Ray does not and never has got the whole concept of morbidity, which is central to Beef's world view. Isn't there some interview where Chris Onstad says that concepts like suicide are just not on the Raydar? <br/>

      While I didn't think the strip was funny, I think the point may be that it is Ray who has changed . . . in the most recent panel, the reference to shooting oneself would be easiest, but he doesn't even go for it, only mentioning Cobain's music. Presumably their relationship is changing with or without the marriage.
