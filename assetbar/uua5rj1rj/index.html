      I loved the drawing Onstad did for my personalized cookbook. It's Roast Beef in a chef's outfit saying, "This cookbook is for a dude who is basically alone in his life." I think Onstad is making fun of me for ordering a cookbook personalized to myself.

      You've never had crispy fries, then, just crispy chips, which are admittedly distasteful.  Crispy fries are basically potato bacon.  So tasty. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only way to get fries called chips here is to order fish and chips.  I order a lot of fish and chips ;-;  We have a semi-major fast-food chain in the Pacific Northwest that actually does a fantastic fish and chips, if I can't move ass to go to a restaurant.  And then there are *street vendors* for fish and chips at the Portland Saturday Market. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically what I am telling you is please do not be too ashamed of us yanks.  At least we can put whitefish in batter and slather it with vinegar.

      It seems like  <em>you</em>  asserted your national identity after I tried to indicate that fries is just a regional name for what can be a different foodstuff to chips.  I don't believe being sarcastic/demeaning towards me in your earlier post and being nationalistic in this one is justified.  I was trying to be polite and even sweet about Anglo/American food culture, but being rude and generalizing us ignores the fact that there are some very nice Americans posting here who don't necessarily enjoy being insulted.  Just in case you were wondering about getting lamed and all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for the differences between our countries, it's pretty rich criticizing our influence when a quarter of the world's population used to be a part of the British Empire.  We're only two hundred years old.  Let us enjoy our adolescence.  Don't worry, I promise we'll flame out and become a rotting, polluted husk within the next century.  Friends?

      Even the most hardcore of douchebags down here can't muster the inventiveness necessary to criticize a damn thing about Canada.  A lot of people aren't crazy about your perverse social freedoms, weird socialized health care, disgustingly cheap prescription drugs, revoltingly picturesque scenery, and so on.

      Thank you!  Just as people in Mexico don't speak Spanish, they speak "Mexican!"  You're absolutely right, it's  <em>ridiculous</em>  that we Americans would refer to the "language" we speak as "English."  You know, the language we are all using to communicate back and forth right now?  Without anyone having to translate?  In fact, I can barely understand your "English," as I have never bothered to learn a foreign language.  (Something I lament almost daily, especially when I have to decipher the strange "English" words you use, like "ashamed" and "business" and "continue."  Ha ha, I guess it's all "Greek" to me! <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, how many senses of the word "wrong" are there?

      This is probably my 15th or 20th time through the archives and every time I get to this strip I sit here and debate on buying the cookbook.  <br/>

Today is the day I ordered the cookbook. I am sick of feeling like Mrs. John Lithgow whenever my friends make me oven fries.

      I love that throwing Pat's fries away has become a thing that they do... They probably don't even have to say anything anymore... Pat just shows up with his prize slug fries, and they all glance at each other, silently saying "Oh it's on...  <em>We are doing that thing that we do!</em> "
