      While I love Achewood to death, this is one of the few strips that I would consider buying as a signed strip - just 'cause of the way that the dog tries to be human. Bonus points are scored for the fact that it starts crying once it can't walk, as if facing the horrible truth that it's just not human.

      I feel like this is possibly the weirdest strip. I remember when I first saw this strip  Ithought it was funny, but at the same time i didn't really get it, it's like it was making reference to a true thing that i didn't know about. Achewood does that a lot and i think it's great.

      The Magreaux Dog is one of my favourite pieces of Achewood folklore. It's like the uncanny, the doppleganger, but filtered through the awesomeness of Achewood.  <br/>

This strip came along about when I started reading Achewood regularly . . . I have great affection for it.

      It is probably not classy to respond to one's own comment 10 months after the fact, but I was just wondering, how many people who hate on the Magreaux Dog get their giggle on for the Mexican Magic Realism camera? I mean, the concept of a Magreaux God is hell of Magic Realist.

      I tried to write a song about the Magreaux Dog once. I couldn't get the lyrics to come out as non-shit (my fault, not Onstad's), but I liked the chord progression, which is a I-III-VI-I in a melodic minor key. The augmented III chord makes it.

      One of the most famous death omens of British folklore is a large. spectral demon dog called Black Shuck. A death omen is something that comes to collect souls. It is a British belief that if someone envisions the Black Shuck they may expect death to come within a year. The large, all black, demon dog is about the size of a calf, with large eyes that glow yellow, green or red as if on fire. These spooks are often headless, with large glowing holes for eyes. They mostly haunt graveyards or enter the homes of their victims. When the Black Shuck comes to claim his victims! <br/> 
his bone-chilling howls can be heard rising above the wind. His feet make no sound, but people can feel his breath on their necks. There are many names for this unwanted visitor, such as, Galleytrot, Old Shuck, Shug Monkey, the Hateful Thing, and Hell beast. Hopefully this superstition does not exist, but if it does, it's characteristics will not go undetected. (Guiley 43)

      I am good with etymology. I am not that good.  The closest cognate I could find was French:  <em>Maigre-eau</em>  ("thinning water.") <br/>

I just sort of strung words together until they were pronounced  <em>Magreaux</em>  and sounded ominous.  Magreaux is also a name given to French dudes.

      I'm intrigued by Onstad's creation here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There have been very few cartoonists (if any) willing to produce an entirely new piece of mythology and build a joke around it within a single strip. It shows skill and a general lack of ego. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad could have easily paraded the Magreaux Dog as an example of creative genius but he instead chooses to make fun of it and potentially soften its impact. This could have been the start of a serious, introspective story-arc about death and coming to terms. Instead it ends with a video colonoscopy and a reference to Lyle's "acting". <br/> 
 <br/> 
The fact that Onstad does this kind of thing REPEATEDLY throughout Achewood is pretty incredible stuff.
