      This is how I was when I was a kid. I thought everything was my fault. One time when I was six I messed up an addition problem. When I went home I just assumed I was going to be expelled and sent to work at a construction yard. I don't think my mother realized how gravely I took the situation. She smiled and laughed, thus worsening the situation in my head.

      When I was five I woke up naked once in the night. (I just kicked off my clothes probably.) Well, my mother had instilled a deep fear of strangers and rape in me, and I didn't  <em>really</em>  know how babies got made. All I knew was strangers plus me somehow equals babies. So I assumed I had been raped in my sleep and I was pregnant and my parents would be mad. I spent the next two months in fearful anxiety, examining my belly for signs of expansion. Imagine a five year old girl with stomach-clenching fears of being a deadbeat mom by six.

A less sexual story was when my brother shit his pants when he was five. He felt warmth and put his hand back there and immediately assumes robbers had broken into the house and chopped up his ass with hatchets.  <br/>

      I used to think my bellybutton was a plug, and once was playing with it and a bit of bellybutton lint came out. I freaked out...because I thought that all my insides would come out. I didn't want to interrupt my mom, who was on the phone, so instead I laid on my back to keep my insides from leaking out and cried myself to sleep.
