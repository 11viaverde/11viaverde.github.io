      If they're really nasty to you, that is the only situation in which it is appropriate to skimp on the tip.  Everything else is probably the fault of Someone Else in the Restaurant. <br/>

Given this comment, though, the server who is really nasty to you is reacting to the fact that you are an  <em>asshole.</em> <br/>

      So, I have spend a good deal of time in Europe since I first read this comment, and I feel like another comment might be necessary here? I wonder if some people truly don't understand the setup that servers have in the US. In England I was LAUGHED AT for tipping my cab driver, but I tipped him anyway. Let me break it down for people here who weren't born in America and/or have never been servers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I was a server at IHOP, my hourly wages were $2.15/hr, which is a curious number that equals somehow 2.15 and also 0 at the same time. If I work for an hour, flat out running between 8 tables, scalding my skin on your plates (while forcing a smile when I gracefully set them down), getting oil splattered on my clothes, cleaning up after your children (or yourself) who leave their table places looking like a small landfill, doing the best I can to prettify what I've been handed by the kitchen, and I come back to your table to find that you have decided that the hour of hard work/physical pain I put in was worth Nothing?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let me tell you something. If you have the balls to show your face in my restaurant again, you will receive excellent service. But you will also be eating my spit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(I have not been a server for 6 years. But Tetsujin's comment still gets to me.)

      In some countries, I believe Australia is one of them, tipping is considered rude.  Servers are paid well and when you leave a tip, it is as if you are saying that you have to give the server extra money because their boss isn't taking care of them.  As such, it is considered an insult to the restaurant and generally frowned upon.

      Have there been any advances in the field of creating a fiesta name generator? That is the kind of thing I would like to play with for a few minutes before growing bored with and forgetting about it. Ideally it would utilize principles such as rhyming and alliteration and would only return fiesta names with at least a certain minimum score on a jerkiness index. Also, every 100th result should be "pendejo".

      Yes, that makes the most sense, but however will Fiesta Max patrons appreciate his oh-so- <em>clever</em>  wordplay?  Does he point to a name tag?  Spell it out?

      I think panel 4 here is a modified version of panel 4 from  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145707/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=08202007">the last Fiesta Max strip</a> , and Onstad just forgot to take the menus out. It'll probably get fixed eventually; Onstad revises strips even after they're posted.

      It's seems that Darin' Aaron Magoo's widow's peak has migrated south to his chin for the winter and transformed him into Jai in the Sky. Plus he got transferred to Fiesta Max - the Casino EXPERIENCE.

      Okay, I gotta say it.  Todd is really my least favorite character.  He legitimately makes me kind of uncomfortable, which is probably a credit to Onstad's writing, but still...he's really the only character I just don't enjoy reading.  I like him as a concept, a tangent, as sort of a catalyst for other characters' discomfort (like the Phillippe birthday party one) but as a stand-alone character with his own arc: yuck.  Sorry everyone.

      Theres nothing likeable about Pat. At least I've known people like Todd, and he can be nice, he's just kind of a low-life.

      The waiter at this restaurant makes me think of the the sqeaky-voiced teen from the Simpsons, in that there seem to be more than one of him.
