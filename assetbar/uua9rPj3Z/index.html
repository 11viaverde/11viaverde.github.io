      I just watched a video showing how to make a rose-water martini. 3.5 cups wodka, 1/4 teaspoon rose water. Or, for a single drink, a shot of wodka and the amount of rose water that drips off a needle. <br/>

      Mr. Cocktail Receipes ran his words together. Harry always made him nervous. He wasn't sure why, the guy ran a pet store, made a few extra dollars "preparing" gold fish for him. Harry always turned up smirking and never answered his questions with anything more than monosyllables, a yes or a no. It seemed Harry was always about to reveal the joke of their situation. He never did, just walked away shaking his head.

      Cocktail Receipes was strict with himself. A friend with a poetic sense of humour had given him the nickname and with a twisted brow Cocktail Receipes had accepted it. Accepted it like that baseball in the face when he was thirteen.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So many things had been revealed to him since those times. These things had not made him less awkward, but they had certainly made him more aware of what people liked. Alcohol for instance. So he decided to make the receipes they would like. It was a business venture and he would be respected. He wasn't desperate for approval, but he liked the slippery business of the alcohol industry. People seemed more unpredictable, but more easy to deal with. Harry being the exception.

      Harry did something to goldfish that stopped them from shedding their scales or colour, even though they were dead. Cocktail Receipes was sure Harry used those stick on googly eyes you could buy for sock puppets; fitting them just under the skin. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Harry was working on the Disco Shoe. He had prepared it and served it with varying degrees of popularity at "8", the high class boys club of a cocktail lounge. One of those places where women with hourglass figures filled the wine glasses you swirled in front of your cigar.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cocktail Receipes laid the gold fish upright in gin, sweet vermouth, vermouth, and a "shoe" of white cream de cacao (basically a Pall Mall with a dead animal). The management at "8" imagined CR eccentric but harmless adding to the places old school charm. No one really came into his little bar "kitchen", where he had his fish laid out in perfect rows. CR didn't know why, but everytime he did this little ritual, fish laid out, he had to smash one of the fish with his fist. Sometimes a piece of gill or gut would hit his face. For some reason CR found the cool slapping feeling of it a relief.
