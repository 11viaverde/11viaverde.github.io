      Over and over I have been given credit for your ideas.  For a long time I tried to deny it, to say that it wasn't my idea, it was somebody else's idea, but it never worked.  Everyone still gave me credit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Eventually I stopped trying to deny it, and just took the credit.  I have earned more than 23 million dollars on your ideas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I have been giving it away to charities.  I couldn't profit from your ideas.  I actually live is a crappy little duplex and drive a crappy old car. <br/>

I realize that I could have been giving all the money to you, but I don't have your address and you never answer your phone.

      Well, although the word homosexual is only used in the title of the comic, it is still interesting to see that gay pat and homosexuals the monkey are similar.  Phillipe doesn't really have any reason to think the words are related, but his mind connects them subconsciously.  It's like some sort of genetic memory ingrained in the DNA of male-kind that just happens to be leaking in the form of cute animals and direct-to-dvd specials. <br/>

      You don't marry adorable 5 year old otters; you buy them and marvel at their cuteness. Until they outgrow their cuteness and then you don't pay that nuch attention to them unless they poop on the carpet. <br/>

      Roast Beef has bought a boat, so that he and Molly can have sex in the main bed area with nobody bugging them. This is a fine reason, neither more nor less sensible than any other motivation which causes a man to buy a boat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
China Mieville  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145144/https://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3328/floating_utopias/">has remarked on the ties between Utopianism and the allure of the sea.</a>  But the link clearly extends beyond economic libertarianism into something broader. The sea is vast, and a fellow will go there and be alone. The sea is indifferent and agnostic, even as it is inhospitable. It is a good place to be lonely, or to be alone with someone else for a time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Alas, boats are prosaic matters, and the joke about a hole in the water into which one pours money are not without basis in reality. I hope that the boat-heartache Beef is about to enjoy is accompanied by a moment under a clear evening sky, with Molly reading O'Brian in the cockpit, and Beef thinking  <em>well what do you know the generator is not making that knocking sound. I straight up fixed that thing this time.</em>
