My first comment, on the other hand, was totally first comment-y: all "check out ray's face in panel 5 it's like that in another strip"   lame joke at the end; 0 chubbies 0 lames.  It did get a reply, though, which really didn't do much but distill my statement into 5 words (which couldn't hurt) yet it got 5 chubbies (not that my post deserved any chubbies).

      No, I still haven't. I've actually been really bad about keeping up with all their reissues and whatnot. I still haven't even heard all of  <em>Luxe &amp; Reduxe</em> . I need to shape up before I lose my super-fan status.

      For serious.  Any super-fan had heard 98% of Luxe & Redux by '98 anyways (at the latest).  A lot of the Evening/Peel session stuff from this time is very good; the And Then/The Hexx version from these sessions is still the best version I've heard (not the version recorded during the album session, or the other one recorded later, or the Hexx on Terror Twilight).  Also, Harness Your Hopes from the same BBC session (the CCR-style version recorded during the album session is horrible). <br/> 
 <br/> 
So hey wait just a question is your name a reference to the beck song?  Just wondering.

      While that is one of my favorite forgotten Beck jewels, my handle is not directly derived from it. Long story short, many of my friends began calling me Robo awhile back because the word contains a shortened version of my given name. Once when I was stoned or drunk or whatever I misheard it as Rowboat. I decided to try to make it stick as a new nickname but it never really caught on. In spite of that, it has found new life as my username pretty much everywhere I go on the internet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've never heard "Harness Your Hopes," but I recognize it as a lyric from "Carrot Rope." Is there a connection? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess I was never technically a Pavement super-fan. Just enough of one to own all of the regularly released albums and a couple of the singles (my vinyl copy of the  <em>Range Life EP</em>  is particularly treasured). Also, I was lucky enough to see them live on their final tour. Still one of the best shows I've ever been to. I'd call myself an above average fan. They definitely ruled a significant portion of my young adulthood.

      Yeah, ditto; they're still classified as my "favorite band" more often than not, so the scholarship angle is present on my part.  I also just realized that my original post, written semi-drunk, is confusing.  All the BBC session stuff I was talking about is on the BTC rerelease, not the S E one...or the Wowee Zowee.  Jesus, what the fuck have I been doing on here recently?  I think I was semi-drunk 1 day ago  <em>and</em>  3 weeks ago while posting.  Man, I should try bringing a girl home from the bar one of these times instead or something.  That might help.  That would help. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, Harness Your Hopes has no discernable relation to Carrot Rope; it's not uncommon for SM to cannibalize his own lyrics and puke them up for other reasons.  Another example: back in, jeez, 98, I want to say, he did 2 small solo shows in LA between albums, and he played a song alternately referred to as "Moby Grape" and "Civilized Satanist" (I don't think it ever got an official name, that's just what the people who recorded it and put it onto an mp3 named it).  He uses the %u201CCivilized Satanist%u201D term in that song a few times, a term which also made its way into Major Leagues on Terror Twilight.

Although I'm not offended I must concur.  The fascination with breasts is an adolescent development.  When the girls in class start to grow those boobies, they entrance.  But when you get into your twenties, and ladies start getting serious rump, it takes a grown man to move from the slim, girlish figure into a real-ass love for a real-ass woman. <br/>
