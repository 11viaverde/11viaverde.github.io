      I'll admit I really enjoyed listening to his a few times, but I'm sick of those easy-sad covers. <br/> 
Like, take any song that reminds you of your first love because there's the name of her dog/street/anything, and sing it like you're so totally sad with an accoustic guitar or piano. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or maybe i'm just angry because most people like the gary jules version better and no one around me knew it wasn't the original in the gears of war trailer. (arrh, anger, makes me answer posts)

      See, the juxtaposition is what makes it good. The contrast makes it more interesting and thought-provoking, whereas Gary Jules just did a plain sad song, which isn't exactly a challenge.

      at the time like three or four covers of 'Lovesong' came out. not sure about radio specifically. but alot of covers of that song are floating around. oftain from bands that really have no claim to a Cure influance (like 311 for example) it's like how there are a thousand covers of 'How Soon is Now' even though it's kinda an odd ball for The Smiths, they had much better songs, that would be more fitting tribute. I think he was mostly talking about all the 'Lovesong' covers that had all come out. wiki it. a retarded amount of acts cover that an how soon is now.

      You know, I probably only like a handful of songs and none of them are from Emotive (Dear lord spare me from that awful Emotive) but when I like a song, it generally means I'll listen to it ad nauseum without ever considering it grating to do so.  <br/>

      Pizza Hut had an almost edible offering known as the  <em>Priazzo</em>  back in the '80s.  A Chicago style stuffed pizza that had four different variations.  My personal favorite was the  <strong>Florentine</strong>  variation: five cheeses, regular Cheddar, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Romano, and Parmesan - combined with ham and spinach.  <br/>

I still think about this pizza when I'm sort of stoned.

      The only song by nofx that I can think of that references the Descendents is off of war on errorism, which is at the time when my punk phase was starting to die. Since you are about the same age as me, it makes me sad to think of all the teenage years you missed not listening to the Descendents. I guess there's no point to this comment except that it reminds me of the good old days. Also, come on! Punk kids don't know about Bad Brains? Circle Jerks? Circle Jerks even played Warped Tour like three years ago. Kids are still listening to them, though I don't know how much good that's doing anybody.

      I bought his recent solo album, and other than the tune he did for the newest Bond movie, I was kind of disappointed.  Maybe I need to listen to it a few more times to sort of acclimate to his new style, but mostly my reaction was "meh."

      I wonder how the mechanics of the "four shit and die" works. Does he shit four times in quick succession and then croak immediately, or is it a drawn out, big deal affair where he will die after his next four shits are taken but those shits will not come any faster than they would have naturally? Like he could walk around and look at people real intense and say stuff like "Another band got famous by covering a song off Disintegration and I have taken three shits since".

      I think no one of any age has any business stomping around acting punk rock anymore. When the kids do it (post McD.L.T.) it is at best completely uninteresting and at worst just fucking ridiculous. When the adults do it (pre McD.L.T.) it just looks silly and kind of really sad. It was good that punk happened. Essential, actually. But it's no longer happening with any credibility, so let it go and remember it fondly.
