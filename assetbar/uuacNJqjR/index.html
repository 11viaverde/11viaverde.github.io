      Did  <em>not</em>  always speak.  Let that be a lesson to you, Assetbar, when you open the window to shout criticism, be aware that it is a heavy window and there is a very real possibility of that sucker cold crushing your fingers when you try to close it.  You cannot spread negativity without inviting it upon yourself.

      His gimmick is annoying and not funny. His gimmick is sexuality-based but that is not what makes it annoying and unfunny. Harping on it makes you look a little homophobic no matter your claims to the contrary. Those phrases I quoted? All those ever mean is "I am about to be racist/sexist/biased/discriminatory but please don't call me on it, OK?" The second one - normally seen as "some of my best friends happen to be black" - is so played out I didn't think anyone would use it earnest any more. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're dead-set on avoiding any suggestion of homophobia, just don't make homophobic comments. Or just stop worrying about it. This is the internet - somebody will still think you're a jerk no matter how nice you try to be.

      Thought experiment: Consider if retardo was a straight man and Onstad was female. If 80% of his comments were about how much he wanted to fuck her, it would still be creepy and offensive, right?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Retardo's not offensively gay, if such a thing even exists. He's just offensive. That's my point.

      I've always felt like calling straight people who tend to have the right (though slightly misaligned) direction towards queer identity, 'homophobes' is always going to find trouble. If only because of the connotation between homophobia and hate crimes committed under that premise. Most people take it personally because while they don't want to be grouped into that category. I don't blame them, even though...technically...homophobia IS homophobia. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And it's totally okay ( <em>saint</em> ) to admit it, rather than doing the "defend my opinion to the death on the achewood threads" schtick.

      Ah, but therein lies the rub (so to speak)...in your case the blow job is a threat:  "I'll blow you if you  <em>don't</em>  shut up."  Teodor's BJ is a reward:  "I'll blow you if it  <em>will</em>  shut you up."  Much more Brokeback T's way, methinks.
