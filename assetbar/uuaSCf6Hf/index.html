      The trick is that they bounce at exactly the right rate: not too fast so you can't view them properly nor so slowly that you can barely tell they're bouncing at all. Further they're an excellent size for bouncing. Perky, but no so perky that they're more indie rock tits or even punk rock tits while not being the gross huge jugs of hair metal tits or even nasty big fat ones. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They might not be ideal for daily use (I prefer something a tad smaller, firmer, and perkier personally), but for continual bouncing they're second-to-none.

      On that note, listen to any Iron Maiden song while looking at it, and it'll look like they're moving along with the galloping triplets. <br/>

I'm sure other songs/bands would work, but every Iron Maiden song ever is probably the most popular instance of the galloping triplets.

      Now that I've followed up on it and watched it in my private time, I have to say it was a pretty huge letdown. I mean, they're so awesome here on assetbar because I generally only log in when I'm at work and as I'm scrolling down the line at my desk with a fistful of coffee mug there will all of the sudden be this tiny, private window with endlessly bouncing tits in it. That's really nice. It's, like, "Hey! Good morning to you, sir!" However, when I'm at home and the house is all quiet and everyone's in bed and I have a fistful of my dick, I just need a little more than some girl jumping up and down on a balcony.

      Wow, that just perfectly describes the feeling of doing what you done. You see this remarkable pair of titties bouncing up and down on a page somewhere and there's other people in the building. Suddenly you decide on exactly how your night will play out and eagerly anticipate it. As you get home something really stupid and arbitrary comes up and after about 15 minutes or so you get it out of the way. Then you sit down and minutes start passing. You realize you're bored, and you don't know what else to do because this is all that you were thinking of doing.

      Well, I guess I never really said that the video would be high caliber.  I wouldn't even consider it porn.  If your intention was to use it to squeeze off some knuckle children, I would say the video is a primer at best. <br/>

In conclusion, I was merely trying to provide the origins of that beloved assetbar avatar, and I hope that I haven't ruined any of the magic for you.

      This is an astute observation, larger breasts are usually considered better, but if they are large enough that a wave visibly travels along them as they bounce, they become flab tits instead of bouncing spheres of delight. It seems that using simple wave mechanics, applied with known data on the visual speed of perception of the human eye, the ideal size of tit could be calculated.
