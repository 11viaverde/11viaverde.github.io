      It's a pity that the Brat is so ugly, because it's got a great name. It sounds like the vehicle you get if you give a Bedford Rascal lots of presents and attention.

      Well, if he had any sense of taste or style, I would suggest an Aston Martin DB9. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, with that in mind, he's probably going to get a chromed-out 1999 Honda Civic with no muffler and blue neon runners on the undercarriage, and probably a bumper sticker that says "IF IT'S TOO LOUD, YOU'RE TOO OLD"

      He's old enough to work at Starbucks, and they have a 17  hiring policy now. So, he's old enough for a drivers license. That said, I think his Hell vehicle should be that crappy golf cart that Beef wiped out in.

      I once met a hostess in a strip club who gave me her number.  She rinsed her hands with instant sanitizer because the patrons and glasses were so disgusting she couldn't bear to feel the grossness on her mitts.  This was an attractive girl, far more attractive than the so-called dancers.  So I figured I would give it a shot.  She worked two jobs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Her other Job was at friendly's.  In hindsight, if I were dead, and the only way out was to go to a friendly's, I would choose the afterlife.

This is the best strip I've seen in a while. Or maybe I just really love the flowchart format. I especially enjoyed the return of big breasted necklace girl. However, I must note that unwanted babies are far from being the main reason to use a condom, no matter what Tim Price from  <em>American Psycho</em>  says.

      Ugh, you're probably one of those people that lectures about downloading music. He's not making money off the GQ sales - most likely he got a one-time commission that is in no way affected by this. And by the way, out of all the webcomics I read, this is the only one that constantly shoves requests for money in my face and whose content isn't 100% free. So, you know, get off your little high horse.

      It doesn't matter how much money and/or good will Onstad is or isn't making off of this particular comic.  It's simply the fact that it's his fundamental right to limit in some ways the distribution of his own creation.  Maybe he doesn't want a shitty 2nd gen copy of his work circulating.  That certainly detracts from his product's value in the long run, even if in the immediate term he doesn't lose a dime from it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Would it have been that hard to ask his permission to post that?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not that he probably cares too much one way or the other.  It's not that one comic makes that much difference one way or the other.  It's that in the long run, you have your head up your ass.  It would be nice if you could, once in a while, pay a small-time artist a small something for their music, instead of downloading their shit for free.  If you're poor, maybe you could save up and just give some money to every 10th artist.  But if all you listen to is commercial top-40 shit that's distributed by the big labels, which judging by your aura is likely the case, then sure, fuck it, steal that shit for free.  Any artist who doesn't have a 'donation' link on their web page apparently must not want any.  right?  That's my theory. <br/>

      I just used pirate's posts for a science experiment! I know that I can only give five chubbies per page, but I don't know anything about lames or how many I can give. So I lamed all of his comments, and now I know that I can give more lames than chubbies! <br/>

      In Shining Force 2 for the Sega Genesis, "aura" was a healing spell used by a melty-faced priest (vicar?) to mend the wounds of those on the playing spaces around him, though the real-life application of the word suggests a person who has the opposite effect. <br/> 
A person's aura is only ever brought up to illustrate the shittiness they exude, as if the world were an elevator they strolled through, just round-the-clock farting.

      This is so perfect. I was at the Spy Museum here in DC and they had a gift shop at the end of their little course, which had, among other things, the classic Che Guevara T-shirt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I decided I was not going to debase myself as well as Che Guevara's memory by purchasing a shirt with his picture on it from an organization that was garnering capitalist profit from the corruption of everything the man stood for. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I just bought a camouflage painter's cap with a red star on it instead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Why emo kids always wanna dress like Communists? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that's the real reason they passed that law. I mean hell if you saw a bunch of skinny teenagers dressed up like John Adams you'd think this was a nation founded on the pubes of elves.

      Dear deusoma, <br/> 
Some people don't like to be addressed due to their avicons, but it is necessary in this instance. <br/> 
The other night i went to Quizzo (similar, I understand, to the English "pub quiz") and the image burst into my mind at the right time: during a sort-of bonus shouting-out round, the man asked what caused a butterfly rash on the face centered on the nose and was an auto-immune disorder.  A few moments passed, and no-one had answered.  "Lupus!!", I cried. <br/> 
I won a box of nearly expired fruit snacks and a decorative fruit.  It is supposed to be a lemon,  but it is not shaped correctly. <br/> 
I ate 40% of the fruit snacks after I went home and burned the one. <br/> 
So thanks, man.  It was totally Lupus this time.

      A friend of mine told me that the only inviolable law in comics was that "Bucky" stayed dead, referring to Captain America's former sidekick. <br/> 
"An aphorism among comic book fans, known as the Bucky Clause, was that 'No one in comics stays dead except Bucky.'" <br/> 
Okay, "comics police", whatever. Its like a bylaw against stomping on your own balls, not too tempting in the first place.  <br/> 
I guess Uncle Ben sort of has to stay dead too, though that's so built-in it seems to be a more unspoken thing.

      ATTENTION: DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU AIN'T WANNA HEAR ABOUT BLEEDING VAGINAS <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah, dude, they are the best! They're so much better than tampons and/or pads. You only have to change it twice a day (or  <em>I</em>  only have to change it twice a day, but I have a pretty light flow), and you don't have to worry about Toxic Shock Syndrome, whereas if you leave a tampon in for more than six hours, you have to start worrying about dying. Also, all the mainstream tampons have chemicals in them, which can be bad for some women. DivaCups are just silicone, so they don't mess you up at all. They are also much more comfortable than having a pad chafing up your skin all the time.  <em>And</em>  they are much better for the environment, because one cup lasts you literally like twenty years, and you don't have to fill up landfills with be-chemicaled tampons/pads.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, there are two major caveats. One is that you have to be comfortable with your cunt. If you're used to tampons with applicators, it's a little weird at first, but ultimately pretty rewarding. Two is that it really takes three or four cycles to get used to, and I think a lot of people give up during that time. It can really be a bit stressful until you get the hang of it (my bathroom ended up looking like a murder scene more than once), but once you get the hang of it, it is really just the best ever.

 <br/> 
thanks for the good info Loneal!  And yeah, I can't see not being comfortable with one's cunt.  I mean, if a cunt is anything like a penis, I mean, you know, I'm all over my penis like minimum once a day if not more.  I can't imagine not being all over my cunt if I had a cunt.  That would be the most awesome thing to have a cunt.  Man I would get all sorts of mirrors and video cameras just to get a better view.  and damn, that ain't even including the arthroscopic possibilities!   <br/>

      I respectfully and unnecessarily disagree.  It's a big, chunky, muzzle-loading pistol, one that doesn't mince words/sound effects.  KOODGE is blunt, distorted, and chaotic, nothing like the sharp CRACK or POW or BANG of a modern-day rifle.  It's exactly what a cheap, hastily-loaded cartridge rammed down and then awkwardly forced out of a non-rifled muzzle should sound like as it just barely pierces someone's chest.  It's the sound of shooting someone with a weapon that has  <em>character</em> . <br/>

Oh God I can't believe I did that.

      Okay so I am a girl and I like the Mighty Boosh fine (I am British as I have mentioned before) and do not really want to do the sex with either of them, so I reckon they are both pretty funny. But, and I don't want to get all pishy on octafish here or anything, but I think it is sort of lame if a person can get mad props just pretty much for posting a picture of a person who is funny (not actually pictured being funny) on the internetbar for no reason. You know, like if we all just posted pictures of people who are funny and then had a big circle jerk about it, and that was assetbar, I kind of feel like that would not be cool? <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, that Batman slapping Robin picture up there is fuckin' genius, its 80 chubs are kind of well earned.

      Its okay aliiis, you can get pishy if you want, I don't take it personally. I was going for more a visual pun there, rather than a pic of someone funny. I'm a visual person and so I like to emphasis awful, awful puns with pictures. I just wanted a Noel, any Noel, it could have been Coward, Gallagher, or Edmonds (Mr Blobby does anyone else remember this crime?) Fielding is the Noel I got at random. I smiled when I saw him in my image search. <br/>

Plus I'll give you a chubby because someone lamed you and no-one lamed Mr Fielding up there.

      I don't mind the pictures at all. Even a picture that is totally irrelevant and even offensive is funner to look at than, say, tekende using the same achewood one-liner for the 293421409th time that asset.

      I actually agree, I did a image search for Noel expecting to find a paparazzi photo of a drunken Noel Gallagher, but to my delight instead of that I got a lot Xmas related stuff (duh should have thought of that) and Noel Fielding. Basically it was riffing on the above mis-quote "it is now Charley's bell has finally knolled." Which as far as I can tell means Charley's bell has mountain-topped.

      Hardly anyone would want their real body in the afterlife, when you think about it.  Isn't there something about your body you'd want to be rid of?  And at what age would you like to be frozen in time?  It all gets quite ridiculous.  I think we get an idealized version of ourselves at out best, whenever that was.  For me, I can think of 3, 8, 19, and 28 as really fine points, along with right now.

      In an interview with AV Club he pretty much admits to liking shitty roles. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have no respect for the man, he has absolutely no talent and the only reason I don't hate him on the level of a Mike Myers is he doesn't make movies that blatantly offend my sensibilities.

      I don't like a lot of the stuff he's done lately, but in Brendan Fraser's defense, I feel compelled to mention Encino Man and Airheads.  He's not a horrible man, he has made some bad choices, but one day he may see the light and return to his former glory.

      I really doubt it. Encino Man, Blast From The Past, and Airheads are good, but much like Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Adam Sandler, he looked the vortex straight in the eyes AND WENT MAD. <br/>

      I'm afraid my knowledge comes from the Internet. This is what I gleaned about sex from listening to my dad: EW GROSS THEY'RE KISSING LEAVE THE ROOM AND DON'T THINK ABOUT GAY STUFF YOU'LL GO TO HELL <br/> 
 <br/> 
Recently a particularly phobic reaction of his to some mildly sexual something or other prompted me to say, "Um, Dad, you  <em>have</em>  had sex, right?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Three times: once for you, once for your sister, and once for your brother." (Apparently the baby my mom miscarried was the spawn of adultery.)

      One does sometimes feel that the internet has become the stadium for one giant competition as to who can be turned on by the most obscure things. 'I'll see your lactating dragon and raise you a man being turned into a dolphin' say the main perverts of the internet. If things continue to go this way the human race will stop connecting arousal with the sexual act altogether, and just spend their time masturbating to a video of a dog chasing a very tall clown down the street.

      Yeah, I don't like that idea. I enjoy being that girl who likes video games and music and comics and geeky things that boys are surprised to find out about. If the sexy sorostitutes with big boobs find out how to play Halo and Mario Kart, my entire dating strategy will have to be reevaluated.

      Your dating strategy is to know about computer games and comics? If knowledge of comics starts getting people laid we are looking at a much nerdier future. <br/>

My dating strategy is to wear a sprig of parsley behind my left ear, and scowl like crazy if anyone mentions it. Chicks dig mystery.

      I disagree with your assertion that girls who like stupid shit are actually people and not empty shells, but agree with your last sentence, so we'll call it a draw for now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the prof's business model is doomed to failure, however, because it grossly overvalues both the proportion of guys who value video game skills and nerd-coolness in girls, and the demand for those types of guys among girls in general. Sadly, outside the utopia of the Internet both numbers are fairly low. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will now conclude by stating my usual stance that people in general suck whether or not they like video games and that no one should be with anyone ever.

      Stupid shit is relative.  A lot of people think video games are a mindless distraction, as mindless as glitter and popular children's music.  One isn't intrinsically better than the other. <br/>

I just hate to see my less-enthused-about-Super-Smash-Brothers sisters get so tutted at.  They're just as capable of being interesting people, and really, in terms of relationships, common interests lose their luster after a few years.   You can only quote Earthbound at each other so much.

      This attitude among men is the equivalent of when women talk about being able to train men into being what they want.  It does not work either way.      <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, I do wish to point out that the nerdy thing is very much coming into style.  When I was in my teens, us comic/video game/sci fi reading folks were maybe 1:50 (regardless of sex).  Now I'd guess its more like 1:10.  It is coming around.  Also, I am fairly sick of the hollywood sterotyping of nerds.  They need to get over the pocket protector/glasses thing.  Most of the 'nerds' in my school were very average looking, many worked out, and most dated...they just didn't date the prom queen.  The ones who didn't date or were always alone were the ones who had troubled home lives or parental problems. <br/>

      I think the problem with the pocket protector/glasses stereotype is that it overrepresents the math/computer nerds, who may also be sci-fi nerds and perhaps even D&D/fantasy nerds. But there are also anime nerds, music/theater nerds, and goth/metal nerds that just aren't captured by that image at all, and sadly they all had to grow up without a stereotype to assure them that they weren't alone.

      Fashionable?  Is that what he told you?  Abe wore that onion because he was under a dreadful curse, so terribly infectious that even to reveal the consequences would be to invoke the curse upon yourself.  Needless to say, he wrote a book about it in German, sent several thousand coupies overseas, and that is the story of how World War Two was won.

I also wanted to mention that Jack Nicholson was raised for most of his childhood under the impression that his Mom was his sister and his parents his grandparents, so these things do happen.

how would you like to play a game? It's going to be simple because i don't  <br/> 
have time for complicated things. Here's the rules: <br/> 
1:You tell me your favorite animal, this could be the cutest? The wiset?  <br/> 
What are the reason(s) this is number one on your list I don't care just  <br/> 
tell me. <br/> 
2:What is the most food you eat, the most common meal for you. <br/> 
3:This is the end of my post (because I  <br/> 
only get the one). I will tell you a truth about yourself based on the  <br/> 
things you've told me. A truth even you might not know yourself <br/> 
 <br/> 
let the game bells play" <br/>

      I'm fine with Nephew dying, but not as jubilant as I thought I'd be.

      Hey, syrupykeyboard, I just realized that the image of the comic that our favorite retard has been incontinently posting all over the board is directly linked from the photobucket link that you posted. So I mean, if you wanted, you could affect the look of the whole board by deleting that image and uploading a different one with the same name. For instance, you could replace it with something more pleasant, like a unicorn frolicking in a meadow, or perhaps a smallish block of text saying "I am a giant douche who gets off on trolling webcomic messageboards. Please hit the ignore button now." I have saved an image of the strip and will repost it elsewhere in case you decide this idea appeals to you.

      You go way beyond simple grammatical errors. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Imagine the english language is a tender young cabana boy named Felipe. You are a traveling, lonely, sexually frustrated businessman named Jorge. One day you meet Felipe and begin to earn his trust. You learn a little about him, just enough to take advantage of him. Then one day you take Felipe, and in an attempt to serve your own selfish desires you rape him. You violate him. You turn Felipe's anus into a playground of blood, feces, and tears. After what you've done to Felipe, he will never be the same. He will never trust again. Never love again. <br/>

Shame on you, Jorge. Shame on you.

      It would hurt really bad. But then again, every time I've experienced an extremely severe injury i didn't feel the worst of it but just the side effects until later. In this case there would be no later, so I'm guessing you would be shaken by the impact, and feel a numbed pain where you had been shot, but what you would be most aware of would probably be the feeling of all the blood leaving your brain, within a few moments you would feel like you were going from hot to cold quickly in a spinning room, your ears would ring you might feel nauseated, and the hardest part to imagine of all that your ability to perceive these things or think about them would be leaving you rapidly along with your strength.
