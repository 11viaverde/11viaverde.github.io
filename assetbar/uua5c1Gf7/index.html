      I think it's quite possible that Ramses got a divorce from Ray's mom and got re-married, probably a few times. The man with blood on his hands doesn't sound like a dude to settle down with a lady for too long. This is also considering that the guy called himself a "half-brother".

      Zero gravity isn't a problem. Even at 400km up - the orbit of the space shuttle (which, by the way, means that, at a maximum altitiude of 15km and a maximum missile range of 180km, means the F/A can, indeed, never hit an orbiting space shuttle) - even at that altitude, Earth's gravitational pull is at about 90% its usual strength. The only reason orbiting astronauts feel weightless is because they're freefalling. (No, seriously. Go look up how orbit works.)

      I think what he's saying is that the missile's hardpoints can't function in zero gravity. Think of how a missile navigates, turns, etc. Also I'm not sure that they use the right kind of fuel, (space) rocket fuel is not the same as what's used to propel a missile.

      Now, the internal weapons bays of an F-22 Raptor might well function in microgravity, because they use hydraulic rams to push the missile free of the airframe. But the Raptor can't make orbit under its own power either.  <br/>

Ideally, the Blue Angel would have to trade in his F/A-18 for an F-15 equipped with a Vought ASM-135 antisatellite missile. The Blue Angel would most likely have to invert his aircraft over the improbably-equipped Eagle, shoot the Eagle's pilot with his sidearm, and then leap from plane to plane while in midair. Oh, and he'd have to be wearing a pressure suit to deal with the low air pressure at the altitude at which the ASM-135 missile can be fired, since the F-15's cockpit won't pressurize with a bullet hole through the canopy. <br/>

      Widely considered to be the very finest of the Hellerbach series, the 1903 model was nevertheless plagued by numerous problems throughout the design process, most notably cheaply-obtained typing keys, later discovered to have been originally produced in Mexico. As such, all models from the first production run would inexplicably begin to run out of ink whenever one attempted to finish a page, after which the distinct scent of floral perfume could be detected. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While replacement keys were issued, investors were so distraught over the failed first run that they pulled support for the company, in spite of the many advances in typing technology the 1903 model made otherwise. Board of Directors chairman James Fitzgerald Smuckles would famously state of the debacle, "there is no market for a typewriter that will not obey the commands of an honest man."

      I have a sneaking feeling that Dornheim's efficient, to the point manner hides deep insecurities. <br/>

But this is Achewood, so it's a pretty safe bet that any character, new or old, is hiding Deep Insecurities.  Except Philippe, and even he isn't so much hiding them as putting them off until his teenage years.

      The childhood cooler is the sister of the childhood drum. The drum, in turn, is the nephew of the childhood blanket. The blanket, you know, is the cousin of the childhood bicycle. The bicycle functions as a sort of caretaker for the childhood skates. The skates share an apartment with the childhood tire. The tire is a strange bedfellow with the childhood musket ball. The musket ball shares a casual acquaintance with the childhood laundry hamper. The laundry hamper has nothing to do with the childhood binoculars. The binoculars are the son of the childhood medicine ball. The medicine ball is the tenacious enemy of the childhood weighted companion cube. The weighted companion cube is the dear friend to the childhood collectible Jäger bomb tumbler. <br/>

When these guys talk about fond childhood memories, they don't mess around.

      Alternate story arc ending -- we discover that, with congress deadlocked on new military spendin, the CEO of Boeing decides that drastic action must be taken to preserve sales.  Looking wildly for a new business model, he strikes on the model employed with much success by other companies such as LEVIITRA and the dodgy mortgage refinancer -- namely, spam.  Howere, in a strange twist of events he manages --the horror!-- to get ahold of the Ebay Platinum Reserve userlist. Now, knowing the names and addresses of the world's richest, least scrupulous impulse buyers, he puts his plan into motion...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Months later,  having finally succeeded in replicating the 1908 Hellerbach typface, this mysterious man looks at the first name on his list -- the man who bought Airwolf...  <br/>
