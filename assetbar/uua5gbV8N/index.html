      As I go through this system more and more, I see more and more trends by posters. This, for example, is the second one in which I've seen you refer to Phillipe as a dildo. <br/>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Absolutly. Achewood is a work of art. Totally daring. I mean, never mind the topic of my obsession - Chris talks about all sorts of things in his work you never see anywhere else! Is there any other comic that really, honestly talks about depression/crippling emotional issues like this one? No. Is there any strip that uses an innocent character like Phillipe and uses them to explore the corruption of innocence like this? No. That critiques pop culture brilliantly like this? No. Seriously. This is brilliant, brilliant stuff. And yet there's clearly some other Retardos on the board, who totally only get it on a periferal level and also enjoy it too. It's just art. I'm in awe. I always am.<br/>
<br/>
Chris Onstad: You. Are. Rad. </em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is the above post, spam-reported out of existence. I think as ill of Retardo as the next man, but this is actually a rather nice (if not a tad overly sycophantic) post on his part. It did not warrant the spam-shot. Were we to respond in the same manner to every sycophantic post on the boards, we'd lose half of all the posts! Did spam-marking Retardo just become a peripheral function of the users of old, like laming Asherdan?

      I think spam marking should only be used for posts that actually are spam, like, I don't know, stupid adverts, or the thing we had recently where manflesh was posting all those things that fucked everyone's shit up. If it's a comment you just don't like, it shouldn't be spammed, it should be lamed.

      One Christmas during the early 80s recession, instead of the Godzilla with fire tongue and shooting fist, my folks got me this dimestore dinosaur which, when plugged in, would whir loudly and haltingly walk on its clumsy C-shaped feet. <br/>

Philippe's situation is the worst, though, because it's a "just because" gift.  A birthday or Christmas or whatever at least can put you in the mindset to politely endure a terrible present.  But this ... jeez, the WalletPen just  <em>blindsided</em>  the poor kid!

I had a real weird situation with toys. <br/> 
My mother couldn't afford to get me most stuff, but she got me a lot of books.... and I had the ENTIRETY of the Natural History Museum's plastic model dinosaurs collection.... including the self-paint ones and the glow-in-the-dark ones.  <br/> <br/> <br/> And that was cool by me. <br/> 
Only retard kids wanted the hinge-jointed things with vocalised roar and moving jaws...  I had internally proportional models with the proper  <em>Taxonomic Name</em>  and  <em>Time Period</em>  on the underside. <br/> <br/> <br/> ... And now I have a Palaeobiology degree.  <br/>
