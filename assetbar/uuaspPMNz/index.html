      Yeah not many people realise this but Christopher Columbus was a fucking retard. Chris is all like "The Earth is much smaller than you think!" And everyone is like, "No, Chris, it's not. It's really fucking big and there is no way you can get to India by going west from Plymouth." <br/> 
Chris is all "You guys just think the Earth is flat!" <br/> 
Everyone is all "No we don't, Chris. We know it's round. Everyone has known the Earth is round for years. But there is another continent between here and there, the Dutch told us about it." <br/>

      Except that most historians agree that, while dramatized just a little, his interpretation is pretty accurate. Most knowledgeable people, even the church at the time, agreed the Earth was round and had for a few decades. The people who believed it was flat were your common peasant, not the royalty that Christopher Columbus had financing his voyage. The "You'll fall off the edge of the world." thing was likely used as a "We don't want to spend money on you, let's toss out some fairy tale and hope you're uneducated so you can just shut up. You're not? Well, crap...  Fine, why not? If you DO find a way there, you can bring us back untold riches. And if not, you'll be out of our hair."
