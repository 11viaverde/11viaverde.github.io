it's all "did i dooo thaaaat?" <br/>

but i like the concept of how in japan you have to dance-dance to log in to your bank account, and probably to like use a drive-thru and stuff.  is it true you can buy used underpants from a vending machine?  man, fucking japanese.

      The original version of that article included a lengthly dissertation on how to acquire panties for the purposes of panty-fetishism-indulgence. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There used to be a jacket fetish article, too, which also included unusually explicit descriptions of jacket-fetish-goings-on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Voraphiliacs get very uppity with Wikipedia because their article keeps getting deleted for lack of sources. I seriously saw in the comments section no fewer than two different contributors claim that since Wikipedia wouldn't carry an article about their fetish that Wikipedia was denying they existed. <br/>

      The first sentence in that article ("Panty fetishism is the belief that panties (or female underwear) contain an intrinsic sexual power.") is the strangest description of a fetish I have ever heard.  It's like turning a fetish into a dirty superstition.

      The textbook definition of a fetish is objectification of an inanimate object, giving it supernatural power (of any kind, really). <br/>

      I think it's been said before, but it could be also that Ray is so good of a friend that he is being mean to Beef, so he doesnt' resent as much the unavoidable separation that comes when a friend gets married. Kind of what my last girlfriend did, being all distant before breaking up with me on the morning of Feb. 14.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, man, now that i've thought about it, Ray's login process is way easier than my bank's. :(

      I think that he was being facetious; Molly does orgasm, but he's pretending that she doesn't because she's wanting him to try something different, and Roast Beef's gently chiding her about why regular sex doesn't do the trick for her.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's why she says "Ha, ha", since she already knows that the regular sex is fine. Beef is just being mildly difficult for no particular reason. <br/>

      I'm really torn on whether to chubby or lame this. On the one hand, the sentiment expressed is highly questionable; on the other, it is a finely wrought outburst. Either way, I'm gonna mention chubbies and lames just a couple more times in the hopes of provoking another one. You see, chubbies and lames...

      Okay.  My pants look ugly.  You caught me.  Real impressive, champ.  I think myself, yourself, and everyone else here already knew, just by looking, with their eyes, that my pants look ugly!!  What gets me is that you have to bring it up.  You can't just let it go unsaid.  My pants stand on their own as a testament to how ugly they are.  You mentioning it doesn't make them more or less ugly.  It only hurts a lot of peoples' feelings.  Maybe even yours.  Have you looked at your own pants, lately?  I'll refrain from stating the obvious.  That's the advice I offer myself.  Advice  <em>you</em>  should have heeded.

      Panel 6.  The arched eyebrows.  The slight head quiver.  The small, flat mouth.  In mid ass-gyration Ray is jerked back to a reality where banking is a serious business to be conducted by serious men and women, not little dance-dance boys.  It is only natural that he would lash out.

      Ray has been very short with Beef recently, and has also found himself jumping at the chance to make a measly 250k writing romance. Maybe he's secretly lost all his money. Or maybe it's just lazy writing from Onstad. (thank u 4 the free online comic strip btw, 'stad)
