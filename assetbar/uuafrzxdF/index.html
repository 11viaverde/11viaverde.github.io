      Urg. I don't know about discussion. The posts are getting unwieldy to say the least. There's a lot of unthinking blah starting to appear; neither the brief, pithy fan-posts that make us laugh, nor the microscopic analyzes that make us think that the poster may be abusing his Ritalin again.  Spelling mistakes and micro-feuds are cropping up doggs; this is all getting out of control.

      I didn't feel this strip was all that confusing. Phillipe got sassy on junk food and wrote a swear, and Beef, obviously jovial on juniper oil got a groucho stache for the amusement of some strippers. No doubt he was goaded into doing so by the sensuality of Destynee's purple easy spirit pumps.

      I don't refer to the basic premise of the comic - "dudes in bar, phillippe home alone". I refer to the point Onstad is trying to make. The comic feels hell of incomplete, rushed, addled. An idea he wasn't able to translate to strip form adequately.

      Philippe was left alone in the house while the boys went  out on the town. Unfortunately, he got a little rambunctious (possibly on the ol' not-water-juice) and apparently got into Lyle's supply of AMC Movie Nachos, from when he was working the snack stand, and also found what appears to be a magic marker. The question is, did he sniff that magic marker to get high, or merely write a profanity, truncated due to space? I think most of us learn the spatial requirements of the word "Fuck" around the time of middle school marble notebooks, but apparently Philippe's disillusionment is a bit more rapid. I hope that this has been of assistance to you.

      Actually, depending on individual body chemistry, some people reach .08 on 2-3 beers.  That's domestic, not micro.  I know people, myself included, who are safe to drive at or near .08, and I also know people who are not safe at .05, it all has to do with how your body reacts to alcohol.

But when you drink-drive, that's when you go beyond just endangering yourself. You're endangering every single person you go near, and that is NOT okay.

Philippe has indeed been left alone in the house, but he hasn't realized this yet.  The fact that he is coming through a door from the right in Panel 3 and speaking from the right of Panel 6 makes me believe that he is walking in on the detritus of the pre-party held by the boys before they left for the strip club. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The contrast is between the special future that Philippe believes awaits him and the dirty reality that really does.  He is about to be reminded that he is not the center of the universe, not even the center of his little household who have all abandoned him for the evening.  His lofty dreams of a sparkling Disneyland will soon be replaced by the base yearnings for any form of escape from the demands of adult life, those same yearnings that have taken hold of his companions. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I made myself sad.

      Do you know, I believe you may be right. Not because of Philippe's entrance and exit points, but mostly because of the magic marker and Roast Beef's Groucho Marx-face (although I originally took those for prosthetics). It's the bloody glove, Philippe is the victim, and Harper's 27 Women is the white Ford Bronco. I think we will have to stay tuned for the next strip to find out who the Real Killers are. Or maybe we'll just get a return of the golf blog instead, to really keep the analogy going.

      I can't help but notice a prevalent theme of loss of innocence in Achewood lately.  One of the things I love about Achewood is it's emotional range - in addition to being funny, it can also be mysterious, surreal, darkly funny, and down right depressing at times.  Truly, it is not a comic for the faint of heart! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again, this strip does seem to offer a little consolation - sure, the contrast of the grownup's (are cats and stuffed animals grownups?) sleazy Friday night debauchery against Phillipe's bright and innocent dreams is a little disheartening... but, a future that allows for the opportunity of turning oneself into Groucho Marx on a drunken whim isn't all that bad of a future at all!  Perhaps, rather than seeing a sobering contrast between Phillipe's imagined special future and the dirty reality that actually awaits him, we're really seeing more of a mapping from childlike delight in the unattainable prospect of a trip to Disney world to the easily attained grownup delight in... um... getting puzzled on some brews at a strip club. <br/>

      No, I think you're on to something.  We have a (literal) backdrop of grind zombies, piss, and girls named Tyrone.  But Ray and Beef are taking part in the kind of foolishness that would thrill Philippe.  So, yeah, Philippe may have to lower his expectations a bit, and learn that children aren't  <em>so</em>  special that they're the only ones that enjoy drawing on Groucho eyebrows for a night on the town.

      Huuuuugs all around.  You can't be truly sad when reading a Phillipe strip.  Still, your analysis makes a great deal of sense.  Phillipe's pain in this strip is caused by his isolation, caused by his lack of worldly urges.  Ray's and Beef's pain is caused by their worldly urges.  Pain, regret, and death are what await us all.  Except Phillipe, who is Five.

      if this is true, a few questions arise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
one, will Six be a huge impact? will Philippe still run the Olympic torch? (for that matter, will everyone's future projections still come true? Beef singing and Ray losing his ears? is my avatar now viable to conscription to the flames?) i can hardly imagine Six being the same as Five. after all, they're COMPLETELY different numbers and Philippe knows it. (i suppose it can/will be argued that though his age may change, being A Special Boy never will.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
two, when the dogg  <em>is</em>  his birthday? <br/> 
(answer- it's in some blog that i'm not looking for right now.) <br/>

seven, which is after six. <br/>

      in very, very small subtext below the original story of Creation in Genesis, it speaks of how God made Philippe Five before anything else and for a time, it was Good. then God decided to make the Earth for Philippe to Enjoy and then said He wasn't "going to be selfish" and chose to make Man such as to share Philippe with.

      I think that's an effect of the lighting.  The left one is in shadow, so it only appears to be smaller.  Also, the model may be standing with her right shoulder slightly closer to the camera. <br/>

      Man, at first I thought Harpers' was advertising "Dangers," not "Dancers." To me, if a bar has pool, liquor, and dangers, then it seems likely that there will be one or two individuals of the vaginal persuasion there as well, though probably not the sort you can discuss Gaugin with, I'd say. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dangers would include that cool knife trick Bishop does from  <em>Aliens</em>  and bobbing for apples except its out of a flaming trash can, not to mention an amateur and spontaneous bout of tattooing.

      The worst thing about the "ignore user" feature is that it doesn't completely erase their comments from existence, it just greys them out - thus highlighting them even more and just making me curious to see the car wreck I know awaits. Its like the temptation to scroll below any youtube video and view the idiocy that lies beneath. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course I don't have to click on it, but I just can't resist you know - it's exactly the same with comments that have been lamed to oblivion. I need something more effective, more permanent here.

      Whenever I go into a bar, I like to carry a sign that says "FUCK." Because you know, sometimes yelling it just isn't that satisfying. Or, conversely, sometimes you just want a little love. Conclusion: a "FUCK" sign is a useful accessory for any night on the town.

      My local 20-screener used to be obvious about this kind of shit.  They would regularly just have black garbarge bags filled with popcorn (cooked the night before... <em>maybe</em> ) in the area by the poppers where, you know, you expect fresh popcorn to be sitting.  It was stale and flavorless, and you couldn't even mask it with "butter" since they'd barely put any on it when you asked.  And this is the most popular cinema in the immediate area. <br/>

They probably still do this; I just don't go to this theatre anymore.

      So it's not all thoroughly explained, so what? Strips never are, are they? We get to fill in gaps, adding to the fun. I'm not getting the amount of confusion this strip's causing. It's a bit of a surreal one, and a bit sad (and a little manic? anyone getting a manic tone?), but it makes as much sense as anything else. In life. Yeah, I like it. *decided*

      I agree. The sadness comes from the juxtaposition of childlike innocence with harsh reality. The innocents (Phillipe, the retarded man) conceive the world as a happy place, where broken eggs get better and that everybody values the child's happiness, and the unnerving sadness relies on the reader's knowledge that those things aren't necessarily so.

      This is exactly right.  This is why this strip is so sad.  Also a bit maudlin, but the more I read it, the more I like it.  Voted 5 for the best non-funny strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As an aside, I think this strip is way sadder if you are a parent yourself.  I think it reflects the way people think when they see their kids getting older.  So many times someone puts their own needs ahead of the kids (like putting on a movie instead of playing with the kid, or going out and leaving them with a babysitter.)  Then you realize the number of days when they are excited to see you and play with you are limited--and you've wasted so many already.

      I appreciate your unique perspective, but calling this "the best non-funny strip" makes me want to ask you, with no malice or asshole smirk of any kind, if you've read through everything. If by some chance you haven't, try out  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145829/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=06302005">this</a>  and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145829/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=07012005">this</a> . Not to say that they're necessarily "non-funny," but that the humor kind of flits around the edges of a larger territory.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
This one's decent, but I'm not about to stand up and defend it. Suffice it to say that it's the first time I've dipped below a 4 in a couple of weeks.

      Yeah, I've read those, and they didn't hit me the way this one did.  I've read the whole archive numerous times.

      this is not a bad strip. not at all. in fact, everyone struggling to decipher it only makes it better. the best art is never too literal- so why should onstad have to treat us like children? did cartilage head make perfect sense? or ever get a thorough explanation? no, so what exactly warrants giving this strip a low score? <br/> 
 <br/> 
i actually think this strip has a lot of meaning. my interpretation: onstad is contrasting the dreams of both children and grown men, to see what we wanted then and what we want now. philippe thinks he is old enough to go to disney land. the age of innocence. whereas any other achewood character considers a strip club to be their own disney land. at the same time, both beef and philippe are shown to share the same childlike innocence, though philippe has still yet to be corrupted by age. and i think the question is posed: what dreams came true?

Seriously, though - get rid of her. If you've taken her for a serious tour of the essential strips (and that's a big  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">IF</span> ) and she still finds this comic merely "cute," there's a real problem, there. I mean, on a  <em>deeper</em>  level than comics.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like the girl I was dating a long time ago who couldn't "get"  <em>Rushmore.</em>  I mean, yeah, it's just a movie. But it's such a basic sort of thing to "get." Not being able to kinda really indicated something deeply unsettling to me.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
People who like comics like  <em>Cyanide and Happiness</em>  will never stick around long. They have no attention span. Appreciation of character development and the general sense of patience which a comic like this sometimes demands is not a quality to be taken lightly.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, you're a goddamned teenager. Bone away. But stop telling us about it. It's lame. Or whatever.

      Not everyone will appreciate Achewood. And it's pointless to try and make someone like something when they just don't get it. I've had friends who used to try to make me love the object of their fandom as much as they did, and it just doesn't work, no matter how good the sex is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said,  <em>Cyanide And Happiness</em>  is not exactly a sophisticated strip. It's more of a vodka cooler, enjoyed by teenagers and soforth, whereas Achewood would be more like a nice Cabernet Sauvignon. One must develop a taste for it over time. It's complex, something to be enjoyed on many levels, and especially good with robust meat dishes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, if you post about having sex with your teenaged girlfriend any more, I will be forced to tell you what it's like to be on a Klondike streak. And believe me, it's boring.

      Well, he's seventeen. If you find your soulmate at the age of seventeen, you are in the minority. And if you were a completely mature and adult person at seventeen, you're in an even smaller minority. <br/>

Besides, he's said in the past that he liked her  <em>before</em>  it became known that she didn't like Achewood, so there's obviously other reasons he likes to be around her. (For instance, she could have great tits, or be the only girl willing to put out for him, or she could be otherwise a fantastic person.) And they've been together for what, two weeks, tops?

      As one who is technically still in the range of years known as adolescence, I completely agree. Maturity is a commodity that is in ridiculously low supply among teenagers, myself likely included. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plenty of couples that start in high school are doomed ones, because most high-schoolers don't want a relationship, they want something that'll moan when they hump it. I didn't get into my current relationship for sex, I got into it for friendship and companionship. And sex. I'll be honest. But not ONLY sex, is the point I'm trying to make here. I'm a sentimental kind of guy, and I fell for her hard. There's a reason it's working for us: Sex was an effect, not a cause. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can understand the euphoria that comes with the first time. It wasn't long ago that I was that guy. But I didn't announce it to the unsuspecting internet. Well, until now, I guess. Damn. There goes my argument.

      I have thought of a way to convince your girlfriend to like Achewood. Just show her all the strangers who read it who you've told about having sex with her.  <br/>

Nah there are a few posts towards the beginning that seem to try and describe the meaning or implications of this strip...

      Man I too think it is rad to have alcoholism but seriously, two drunk people having a public conversation on a comic strip messageboard is just NOT what we all came here to see. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Okay maybe some people did. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, though. God love you both but, "I'm this drunk", "Well I'm this drunk", "Oh but wait I'm THIS drunk", come on guys. You'd best have both regretted this in the morning. <br/>

      Oh yes, I regretted it. In my defense though, it WAS written at 3 A.M. on a Saturday (Norwegian time, bitches YEAH). Also, I guess it is felt that drunken posting on this particular strip is just keeping in style with this strip itself.

      <strong>Ahem.</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm going to reveal something about myself, because it is unnecessary to establishing my Internet Expertise on this subject. My name is not Bjorn, and I am not of Norse extraction. My name is Felipe, as I will prove later, (pronounced "Feh-leap" as the French.) However, this is a Spanish spelling of the name, and would be otherwise pronounced "Feh-lee-pay". I have had to correct many high school substitutes on this pronunciation. Likewise, when asked my name, I first say "Feh-leap", and then spell "F-E-L-I...", because most expect the French spelling, Philippe. This is because my name is actually Portuguese, and the sound is unpronounceable in the English language, so I simplify it to a phonetically pleasing substitute in the French. <br/> 
 <br/> 
ANYHOW: Philippe is a French name. You pronounce it "Feh-leep", with a sense of Gallic superiority. Done. <br/>

Phillipe is too young to go, indeed at a special age, in a place where the mere presence of children  <em>is special</em> .  So he has to go to a  <em>special place</em>  for kids.  Which is Disneyland. <br/> 
 <br/> 
P.S. - Only Lyle would eat something as skanky as movie nachos.

      Look, grasping this comic is like getting one of those SAT questions you don't need to have read the reading selection to get. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The comedic similarity between Philippe on the one hand, and Ray and Roast Beef on the other hand, rests on the fact that: <br/> 
 <br/> 
a) They have each found a way to use a black Magic Marker <br/> 
b) They are all talking animals <br/> 
c) In its own way, Philippe's idea of fun is revealed to be as pointless and empty as the grownups' <br/> 
d) They have each consumed drinks out of tall glasses

I hope it has moderate success. <br/> 
Because, can you imagine if Achewood became *gulp*  <em>mainstream</em> ? I mean, all Hot Topic Haley sportin' an ironic Philippe T-shirt. All Abercrombie Amber with her tiny shorts with 'Insert Rad Chilies Here' across the ass and her super tight top with "GOOOOOD TIIIIIIITS" across her boobs. All people coming out of the closet, telling their parents in a robotic voice 'I have known since I was twelve', all their parents ACTUALLY GETTING THE REFERENCE. All us in the assetbarrio rocking back and forth on a corner with a blank stare, repeating in a mumble "I knew it before it was cool. I knew it before it was cool." All Catgrl overreacting, but nobody caring, because nobody bothers to read the posts after the board's been flooded with "OMG ACHEWOOD IZ KEWL LOL" and "LYK, LITERALY LMAO" and even "THIS ACTUALLY WORKS!!!!! 1.) say the name of the boy/girl u like 2 times. 2.) now say the name of your best friend 5 times to urself. 3.) now post this onto 5 videos and then press F8 and then ur crushes name will APPEAR ON THE SCREEN! LAWL I TRIED IT IT TOTALY WURKS!"

      I'm gonna go ahead and throw a prediction out there:  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Achewood will remain on the fringes, no matter the level of success attained by the  <em>Great Outdoor Fight</em>  book. Our ranks will swell, of course. Maybe even considerably. But "Abercrombie Amber" will never get within ten miles of it. And if she does, she won't stay around long. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, you look at a very mainstream, very accessible sort of comic like, say,  <em>Ghost World.</em>  Yes, a million people bought it and probably several million saw the movie adaptation. But how many among them who weren't already familiar fans of Daniel Clowes went on to become avid readers of his prior work? Yes, probably pretty damn many, but not a lot relative to the millions who went into it not already being fans. Most of them saw it and enjoyed it and moved on, 'cause that's the way folks are, generally. And if something as down to earth and massively popular as  <em>Ghost World</em>  didn't have "Abercrombie Amber" sporting, say, a  <em>David Boring</em>  baby tee, I think it's pretty safe to assume that she won't be donning the above mentioned tiny shorts, either.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The nature and the humor of this comic just seemed so specialized. I think it might be household name-proof.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess we'll find out.

      No, the intersection's right, but since the Hot Topic circle is so much bigger than Achewood's, it results in about a quarter of a person overlapping. So, maybe some Achegirl got a pair of socks at Hot Topic after imbibing unwise amounts of alcoholic beverage.

      The cause of being the highest rated strip: Being the best <br/> 
 <br/> 
The cause of being the most viewed: being the funniest <br/>

The cause of being the most commented: a long hiatus between comics, a whiny bitch who wants everyone to know his feelings on the strip, and drunk/high people with nothing to do. <br/>

This strip certainly falls into the latter.

      You're currently my favorite troll. You're like a nega-poster, who thrives on lames instead of chubbies, and is aroused by being flaccid.  <br/>

      Considering the way he acts though, the chubby-lame ratio isn't as dramatic as you'd think, though (he has 160 chubs to 317 lames as of writing). <br/>

Plus the duck avatar is a nice touch. Throws you off when you see such a cute duck spewing all manner of vitriol. <br/>

      There's no need to commit to a schedule, but Onstad always seems to go though a lull this time of year, he'll be back on it soon enough.  No need to do anything rash to the schedule. <br/>

The reason I don't read Perry Bible Fellowship or Maakies is that there is no set schedule, and I forget to go if it's not updated freqently (and I go when Achewood's lagging and I need something, anything).  If there are fewer Achewoods, there will be fewer readers in the long run.

      yeah, she knows.  the brilliant thing about our relationship is that we don't have to pretend to understand each other's gender and it's okay to make fun of that concept.  we're kind of radical in that way, being all sympathetic to our differences and whatnot, you feminist PRICK. <br/>

      Yo, you can act however you want with the girlfriend you told us you don't want to deal with. I'm just saying that when you talk shit about the entire female gender, it's misogynistic.  <em>I'm just saying.</em> <br/>

      This is all part of Onstad's plan. He saw that the comment boards were becoming too crowded, too many people fighting for too few chubbies. Thus he has let this board fall into a state of anarchy in the hopes that we would turn against each other and thin out our own numbers. Soon, poster will fight poster until only the strongest survive, then Onstad will return and usher in a new golden age of Achewood! <br/>

      from the themes and sparsity of recent strips and the messages (especially about his current cold and when he said his circadian rhythm was based in Bangladesh or whatever), i think it's fair to conclude that Onstad is currently suffering a bout of depression, probably seasonal. his motivation and immunity are shot. i had this a few weeks ago ago.. had a bout of viral meningitis followed IMMEDIATELY by some pretty bad bronchitis, and let me tell you, even without the illness, i was in no mood to create. i was also in no mood to shower, sleep, or enjoy anybody's company, and there was nothing i could do about it but hold on to the knowledge that it would pass by Spring. i believe Chris is going through something similar. so let him be. don't give him any additional anxiety, the dude doesn't need it right now.

      Day 5: I tried...  I tried to tell them...  But they wouldn't listen to me...  Damn them...  DAMN THEIR EYES!  <br/>

They didn't believe me.... Strange creatures... The world in peril from unseen foes...  The death...  THE DARKNESS! Instead they jeered and threw me into this forsaken place...  A place of empty souls and fevered thoughts... reeking of foetor and decay!  Thinking me mad with delirium!  The fools cast away their hopes of salvation by locking me in this damned asylum! <br/>

      BECAUSE REGULAR SOUP IS FOR CHUMPS! What you want is a can of hearty chunky cream of chicken soup (with  <em>real</em>  chickeny chicken!) poured into a crunchy all beef taco smothered in nacho cheese, lettuce, tomato, and special Southwestern sauce; wrapped in a soft flour tortilla with a layer of re-fried beans in between; wrapped in a savory corn tortilla with a middle layer of Monterrey jack cheese; wrapped in a deep fried gordita shell smeared with a layer of special 'guacomolito' sauce; baked in a corn husk filled with pico de gallo; wrapped in an authentic Parisian crepe filled with egg, gruyere, sausage and portobello mushrooms; wrapped in a Chicago-style, deep-dish, meat lover's pizza; rolled up in a blueberry pancake; dipped in batter and deep fried until it's golden brown; and served in a commemorative tote bag filled with spicy vegetarian chili.

      i have done it. <br/> <br/> <br/> The MAN who RUINED LIVES and The WOMAN who MET HIM!! <br/> 
- A choose-the-mystventure/audio (not audio) novel! - <br/> <br/> <br/> a foreword (hella fanfiction.net stylez): <br/> 
Onstad owns these characters. i do not. <br/> 
If he so chose, he could sue me into oblivion for this as well as the other Achewood related things I've done but I hope he wouldn't, 'cos I think he is neat and he does stuff what is good. <br/> <br/> <br/> CHAPTER ONE: <br/> 
Poo Coffee and a Musical Number <br/> 
 <br/> 
A repo man stared at a slow-moving car that passed the 24-hour diner he was sitting at. A cool rain watered amber fields of grain in Topeka this 3am, but that was nowhere near here. "..." he scrunched up his nose at the cup of sludge the waitress had called 'his cuppa joe'. "Ugh. Good God. I gotta get out of this place." He waved the waitress, who wore 'DEN SE' on a tag, over to his booth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>IF YOU THINK HE ASKS FOR THE CHECK, KEEP READING.<br/>
IF YOU THINK HE ASKS FOR A NEW POT OF COFFEE, YOU ARE PROBABLY HIGH. (on pot)</em> <br/> <br/> <br/> "Sure thing, suga'." Denise said as she tore his stub out of her book. "L'be $5.83. This for here or to go?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
The man shook his head as he flipped open his wallet, thinking that though you can get the girl out of the fast-food lane you can't get her mind out of the frier. He pulled out a ten-spot and laid it and a few coins from his pockets on the table, not registering what the grand total was and pushed himself up, using the table to stablize himself. He'd begun to shake again and he was all outta pills. Damn but if he didn't hate his profession. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Denise had returned to her spot behind the counter and was busy mopping up the floor where the new girl had deposited a strawberry milkshake a few of minutes back when she noticed the amount on the table. <br/> <br/> <br/> <em>IF YOU THINK SHE ASKS HIM IF HE WANTS CHANGE, YOU ARE RIGHT.<br/>
IF YOU THINK THIS IS LAME, YOU ARE ALSO RIGHT. (so stop reading)</em> <br/> <br/> <br/> "'Scuse me, Sir!" she called out, "Don't you want change?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
The guy, whom she suddenly noticed was quivering like jello on a roller coaster (or like the Items in fattybeaver's avi,) turned around and began to speak in a whisper, "It's not that we don't care, <br/> 
we just know that the fight ain't fair. So we keep on waiting, waiting on the world to change." he pivoted on his heel again and went out into the last part of the night, leaving Denise a great tip and in wonder of when she should take her hams & bacon out of the oven for the early breakfast rush. <br/> <br/> <br/> there you have it, a short fic featuring Denise and her hams.

      Perhaps. But we do pay for it, in a roundabout way. We consume products; advertising shows us products we may wish to consume. Advertising pays for network television. <br/>

So basically, by as consumers making advertising profitable, we pay for network television.

      There are some people who have a right to say, as slalvation does here, that you should not complain about network TV shows for this reason or that reason.  Slalvation is not one of them, as he/she/it has  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145829/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua3tbtXB#comment_17">previously pissed on that proposition</a>  like the stultifying works of Edvard Grieg.

Somehow, such people can't figure out that their lames count as chubbies in my book.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, I'm starting to agree with sortelli and that other misanthrope, brokeaccount.  There are way more comments posted on this strip than is warranted by the strip itself.  Maybe we should resist the temptation to diddle in public, at least until the next strip appears?  That goes triple for you,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145829/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/one_comment?b=M^a11f09b8576e606bcb5038dfdb92fb821&amp;a=M^1397&amp;c=98">javonathan</a> .

      I don't say you should not complain about network TV shows. I was actually saying that something being free is no reason not to complain about it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And, looking through my inbox, the only "correspondence" we've had was you saying something I didn't even bother to respond to, and I lamed it because when I read it I thought, "What a dull comment. Why did he even bother saying that?" And I didn't mark it as lame in the hopes that you would know, and be hurt by it. I marked it as lame because I thought it was lame -- I really don't care what it means to you.

      I have found from experience that very few teachers actually expect good papers.  As long as you write coherent sentences and make it sound like you paid attention in class, you're already ahead of 60% the other students.  This is true in the American school system at least, where the gradual dumbing-down of society has caused teachers to lower their standards.  You don't have to be smart to stand out, just smarter than the guy next to you.  Here's another thing to consider:  think about how dumb the average American is, half of the country is dumber than that.

      We have nothing better to do until the next Achewood strip. I saw 'we' but this is my first comment on this strip. But it's generally true.

Achewood is like a dream where things aren't exactly how they should be, instead it's just how you feel they should be. <br/>

This strip makes sense in my gut, where all the important desicions are made.
