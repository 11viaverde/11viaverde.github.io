While I'm glad you obviously got  <em>something</em>  out of my rant, albeit, the part where I'm insulting how an apparently degenerate audience appears to be thinking (and, thus, affirmed by your attempt to belittle me), I'm only disappointed that it couldn't be what came before said comeback.

      Its just a comment board, and the fact that people actually discuss the comics at all makes this place much better than, say, a youtube comment page. But they are essentially the same thing. Expecting everyone to belly up and say something insightful and unique is a bit idealistic, and its an idealism that is irrelevant to other people's experience. I, for one, would like to read the word Koodge many, many times. Lets not pretend like this is a classroom, or people will stop hanging around.

      I think the sentiment is honest, but the expression of that sentiment is annoying. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I read something really funny, I'm often left with the punch-line repeating in my head. To me, repeating that punch-line is still really funny. To someone else (and, especially, in a medium where that repitition is written down -- even more so when it's written down as the first comment), it's just annoying, un-funny repitition. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I try and stop myself from making comments of that sort, but I can't fault someone for succumbing to the same temptation. Shit's funny. Sometimes it bears repeating.

      "Jump the shark" is one of those phrases that's become so overused that it's meaningless. A shark-jumping point is a point at which a continuing work of fiction has clearly, irretrievably gone into decline. I'm not saying that Achewood is beyond criticism, but I don't really think you can accuse it of jumping the shark based upon something posted yesterday, as you have nothing following by which to judge it. <br/>

      "Jumping the shark" refers to an episode of Happy Days in what many consider to be its decline.  In an effort for interesting stories, they have Fonzie literally jumping a shark tank with his motorcycle.  The moment was so infamous that the phrase became a common description for TV shows (and comics, and everything else it would seem) that have run low on ideas and have taken to using the ridiculous in an attempt to gain viewers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think Achewood has jumped the shark, but maybe it happened really early on and I just didn't notice.

      I kind of like it because I think it sets Dornheim up in a way that shows a propensity towards absurd thought processes, which if nothing else makes him more believable as Ray's half-brother.  <br/> 
I don't know. He looks fairly blue collar, an intelligent guy in his niche, so it strikes me as amusing that upon meeting his half-brother for the first time he goes so far as to imagine not just the explosion, but of said half brother running away naked and aflame. It shows that he has a bit of a silly streak in his thinking which I would not have expected upon being introduced to the character. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like the timing of the last two panels as well. I wouldn't say this is 5'd right off the bat for gratuitous amounts of koodge, but I chuckled. <br/>

      I think I was lamed either because I sounded too sarcastic (which I tried hard not to do but ended up doing so anyway) or because I was trying to start an actual conversation.  One of the two. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I didn't see Ray as the guy running away from the fire.  I thought it was maybe a test-subject or something like that, as the alt-text alluded specifically that they would  <em>not</em>  be exploring that vehicle's construction.  But that he was imagining it was Ray (maybe as some imagination-land justice for Ray driving an Escalade?) makes it funnier in the way you say.

      So, a car powered by a nuclear reactor would have an external combustion engine. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe partnering with Dornheim is not a good idea, but I can totally imagine Ray starting a company making cars powered by nuclear reactors. <br/>

      Indeed. I will add, though, that the engines classified as "external combustion" would function with any heat source. The steam turbine that drives a nuclear sub's propellor is no different in principle than the steam turbine that generates power in a coal-fired powerplant. It eats heat, and spits out rotation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And yes, this means you could stick an atomic reactor in an old-timey steam train. Wear some wicked goggles and travel all over the New West. Fend off bandits with your thirty-aught-six electro-fired rail rifle.

      My favorite aspect of Dornheim - besides this hairline that follows imaginary ears - is that he, unlike any other Achewood character I can think of, shows off his choppers when he speaks. I think it really emphasizes the seriousness of everything he says.

      Man, I totally wanted to say that.  I grew up in Motown, and every year in elementary school, when we learned about how Henry Ford loved all children and saved Jesus and America by inventing the internal combustion assembly line, we'd ask the teacher if there was such a thing as an <I>external</i> combustion engine, and the teacher would hem and haw and never answer.  Even our dads -- most of whom worked for one of the Big Three -- didn't know.  Finally, about two years ago, I saw a design for a Sterling Engine in Make magazine, and I finally had my answer.  Now, I'm waiting for the day that my son (currently a year-and-a-half old) asks that question.  The internal/External Engine Talk should be one of THE Father-Son Talks, right up there with the Sex Talk, the Cats-and-Fireworks Talk, the Bernoulli's Principle Talk, and the How-Does-an-Atomic-Bomb-Work Talk.

If you don't care about getting lames from the knee-jerk "my pop culture kung fu is better than yours" types, please continue to ask honest questions.  If being lamed for no good reason irritates you, it is best to assume the other fucker knows or remembers something you don't.  It might be related to Achewood, but half the time it's some random anime/video game/TV shit.  Searching the Achewood archive  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144729/https://www.ohnorobot.com/index.pl?e=0;n=0;m=0;d=0;Search=Search;b=0;comic=636;t=0">here</a>  might save you a little aggravation, and it will make your kung fu superior. <br/>

Before the BBCode nazis descend, let me note that it is very likely that the OhNoRobot link will not appear correctly due to the special characters in the search string.  I can't do anything about that. <br/>

      American Curl.  If you compare panels 3 and 4 you can see that Dornheim is basically pretty much a modified Ray. Which is not to say that interspecies mating would necessarily be unthinkable in the Achewoodiverse, but if Dornheim really is Ray's half brother he'd have to be at least half cat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe Ramses Luther mated with a bulldog.  Or a bison.  Or Steve Wozniak's sister.

      Well, I suppose I see why people like this strip, what with the explosion and the somewhat ridiculous exchange (feul economy of an oil fire is funny), but it's not really for me.  The name Dornheim sounds like it's  <em>too</em>  ridiculous, as in reachingly so.  I thought the punchline was going to be something ridiculous having to do with Dornheim having mentioned that Escalades' are put together in Mexico.  Although I am relieved by the alt text assurances that there will be no development of external-combustion cars.

      I've read mutiple comments saying the name Dornheim is just too ridiculous and I fail to see why. My job involves scheduling appointments and I regulary see names that simply should not exist. Naming your child after a town in Germany is far less ridiculous than naming your child Gay Cox.

      I would debate that.  Gay could be short for "Gaylord" if it's a man, and Gaye is actually not that unusual a name for a woman, and Cox is about a middle of the road common last name.  So Gay(e) Cox I would say is signifficantly less ridiculous than Dornheim Smuckles. Although I agree that Dornheim is probably a good bit less obviously ridiculous than some of those names hippies name their children.  I had a friend in high school named Oceania.

      My point was that combining that last and first name was ridiculous, not that each alone is. Gaylord Cox is almost worse. But I agree names like Starchild and Floorange are the main reason we need a good hippie holocaust.

Personally, I like the squiggley lines around the car as it's exploding, demonstrating a subtle shaking motion, with the hub caps and one of the front lights popping off. I also found it funny that the windshield appears to be only slightly cracked after such a violent explosion, but honestly, I just thought KOODGE was the funniest part, and zefiel, as a person spending his or her Monday analyzing a web comic and criticizing someone on said web comic's forum, maybe you should calm down a little bit. It's a web comic, not a freakin' literary explication. Must everyone enjoy and express their enjoyment for the comic in only a way that you find fitting? Please, don't make a religion out of a web comic forum, and if you must, don't make it such a "holier-than-thou" one.

      One of the most successful cars of early days, the Stanley Steamer, (not to be confused of course with the "Cleveland Steamer") had an external-combustion engine. <br/> 
     All steam engines are "external-combustion" engines in that the combustion of the fuel takes place in a combustion chamber located outside of the piston(s). Gas turbine engines are also typically external combustion engines in that the combustion takes place in a pressure vessel upstream of the power turbine. Sadly, these rarely say "KOOSH!" although that particular onomatopoeia may refer to a sound frequently associated with steam engines.  <br/> 
     Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the Stirling Cycle engine championed by Dean Kamen, which was allegedly supposed to be the primary power source for the Segway, which apparently no one cares about anymore. Thank Gord.
