      All right we are in the woods at night. It is a little cold, but not raining. We are walking home through some thick raspberry bushes and my friend is eating the raspberries. I am tired and hungry; I should not drive yet. I need to eat something with a lot of caffeine, like chocolate.  <em>My friend has a chocolate goddamn cake in his kitchen for eating!</em>  Oh that's gonna be awesome my leg is stuck in some thorns. We are in the damn woods late at night and there will be cake.

      Okay, so I just got high in Jake's van. I'm okay with that, so what if it's only like my third time getting high, I'll bet they've seen so many people worse at being high than I am. Unless they haven't... Maybe I am the worst person at being high these people have ever met! There has to be a worst! Someone always has to be the worst! Oh, okay, everyone's getting out of the van. God, I fully forgot we were even at the beach. I should go see what the ocean is like. For someone who lives on an island I don't spend much time with the Ocean. Wait, is Jake peeing into the ocean? Oh god, I should turn around. I really hope I didn't just see Jake's penis. What if Jake thinks I saw his penis? I should go tell Nikki that I didn't see Jake's penis, just in case they talk about it later. <br/> 
Just in case.

      Okay, I'm in my car. I just have to make my way home. I think I will drive by my childhood home. I am sad that this house is now in disrepair. I hope no one thinks I am some creep for driving so slowly. Oh man, I just looked at my childhood house. I am hungry as hell. This cheese looks good and so does this beef jerky.

      Stephen Malkmus just got off stage but he didn't play any pavement songs.  I am smoking this hollowed out and repacked Dutch Master as hard as I can, receiving only a headache in compensation.  Thom Yorke comes on stage and now its a spinning headache.  Radiohead's set is a blur, albeit a wonderful one, consequently followed by my making it all the way to my neighborhood two hours away my via my friend's sister's car at which point I proceed to vomit profusely out the window and maybe on the car a little bit, and am henceforth, six years later, still known as "the kid that threw up" to her, but I don't mind because she listens to Hoobastank.

      Man I was tripping some powerful acid with two of my friends and we were walking down the street that connected some of the off campus dorms to the actual universtity. Colors were jumping off cars and and plants were growing before our eyes when suddenly these bright, hot, eye burning colors started walking past us and before we knew it, a swarm of all blonde sorority girls wearing identical sets of clothes in HOT PINK, BURNING LIME GREEN and FLUORESCENT RETINAL SCRATCHING BLUE enveloped us and we drowned in a plethora of mind numbing colors, jiggling tits, round asses and the smell of overcompensating whore perfume. <br/>

      "i am (verb)" is so perfect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
when you are a person who is performing an action while under the influence of marijuana, this is EXACTLY what goes through your head. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"i am riding my bike.  that is acceptable.  oh, there is a street light up ahead.  i wonder if it will turn... oh my god it just turned red.  should i stop?  am i close enough to the light that it is necessary for me to stop at this point?  i should stop.  i do not want to be hit by a car.  wait: what if the light turns green?  what if i don't go fast enough when it turns green.  the cars will honk.  they will know.  they will know that i am high.  i do not want the cars to know that i am high.  but they will definitely know." <br/> 
 <br/> 
then the light turns green before i even get there, which is an event my brain will not know how to process.

      I've never understood the paranoia behind people thinking you're high. I mean, i've walked by cops in a gas station late at night while stoned out of my gourd and with my eyes just {i]terrible{/i] and as long as you aren't like, acting all fucking crazy, why would they give a shit? And that's cops. Most people are not cops, and are therefore even less of a threat.

      Maybe it has to do with low level general anxiety. If day to day you have to make an effort to rationalise basic situations so as to not freak out, walking around baked is a non issue because you always have to deal with that feeling that people are watching you and know something is wrong.

      Tea with SO MUCH HONEY sounds awesome!  The act of picking up the tea pot causes the tray to start tipping off the table. "OH NO!"  <br/> 
Although you think "I should stop this! everything is going to fall! It will land on the floor and I am in no state to clean it well", Your actions are to continue the process of pouring your tea. As the mug fills the weight is redistributed and the tray rights itself.  <br/>
