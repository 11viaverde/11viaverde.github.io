      He's not talking to an escort service. He's talking to whomever is keeping track of all the year's sex positions (because he would hire someone for that). <br/> 
He said he's going to be alone in the bathroom with the water running, which we know from  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101005111156/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=09192006">this strip</a>  means he'll not be using an escort. <br/> <br/> <br/> I know this reply is 3 years late, but I'm saying it anyway.

      I imagine that, since he's doing it for a year, he says the words a little differently each day. <br/> 
Maybe one day, a little Wayne Newton. Another day he's just laying on the couch muttering? I don't know man I'm outta gas.

      So, anyways...I think the chick was a bit creeped that Onstad had done a strip referencing her....and she said so.  <br/> 
Well, flash-forward, ..they made a movie about it, dint they? It's a chick-flick with Meryl Streep as Julia, and some cute Gen-X actress as the Julie. <br/> 
 And I think the actress did a good job portraying her as a boring mutt who basically siphons from the legend to feed her blog. <br/> 
 I told you all that to tell you this: <br/> 
 it was ironic to me that she got her  knickers in a twist about Onstad putting her in this cartoon! <br/>
