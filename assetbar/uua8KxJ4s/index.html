      the give and take here, the witty and sardonic banter, this stuff is a living breathing piece of modern art.  I'm not sure that everyone else sees it that way, but I experience it as such.

      Is there a way I can lame this strip in a way TPTB knew it meant they should actually change the way they think and lead their lives? This is bad, mean-spirited Achewood. I've been here since before Phillipe was standing on it (not possible) and I'm way not down with this strip. This is where I start to see the holes in Onstad's brain & it is the opposite of escapism aka comic strips.

Unfortunately there is always a steady population of people on any internet forum who devote themselves to making the forum experience feel like you're sitting under a damp cloth explaining Neitzche to the drooling victims of animal testing outside a neuroscience lab. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Though... i disagree. This is Nice Pete all over. <br/>

Also, there is something funny about horrible things happening to Teodor. <br/>

      As a guy that married into a Souther family, I just want to put it out there that my mother-in-law describes Southern Hospitality as the art of greeting a man with a smile an warm handshake prior to shoving a knife in each of his kidneys to make sure you're covered on the revenge you'll eventually have to take for his future social transgressions.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know what that has to do with this, I'm just mad because I'm out of beer.

      I think Pete has just finally lost the tiny scrap that was his remaining sanity.  <br/> 
The strip will now take a sudden dark turn in which Pete will kill off all of the characters but Teodor, who will escape to tell the world his story in the form of a comic strip.  <br/> 
and then it will be made into a movie directed by Tim Burton.

      He's not trying to hurt him. This is just the sort of jocular terrorizing that is done between friends and then laughed about later. The problem is merely that Nice Pete doesn't have the proper frame of reference and is otherwise incapable of telling when he is taking things into a disturbing, violent, and psychotic manner. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We've all had that friend who chased us around in his garage trying to set us on fire or who once shoved a fistful of grass into our eyes after it had just been sprayed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Driving off while your friend is taking a shit on someone's lawn actually could be a hilarious, if dickish, thing to do. Nice Pete's problem isn't what he's doing, it's that he's a sociopath. In this way he also is providing a mirror to the sociopathic nature of the similar things that we actually did to our friends.

      Me and some friends had a Jello Fight in my house (it sounds stupid but once a Jello Fight starts, the fun just consumes you and suddenly all of the Jello is gone).  Luckily, my dog will eat anything and was following us around the house, gobbling up all the Jello on the ground.  So we cleaned everything up except some that got on the ceiling.  My parents came home soon and my dog barfed up like two trays-worth of Jello in front of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Being young and innocent, I immediately caved and admitted everything to them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They wouldn't even let me eat it on Thanksgiving that year :(

      gournal, you are comparing a jello fight to slamming at a high velocity the alternate bare metal sides of a van into a person until the person is bruised, bloodied, and has a few dislocated finger joints.  You're comparing this to throwing jello at a person.  Unless there are razor blades in the jello, this does not seem like an apt comparison.

      I think most people do though.  I had a friend who once decided that the first person in a three way football toss to drop the ball was to be hit in the face with the ball while the other held the loser.  I don't remember anyone agreeing to the conditions but in any case I lost and was held with my arms behind my back as my other friend threw the ball point blank at my face.  A great fight ensued.  Ah, childhood.

      no no no that's not how you do it.  I saw on family guy a much better technique.  Don't get in a fight with the person on the spot.  Just let the person know that you will retaliate sometime in the future, wait until they are least expecting it, then shove the person in front of an oncoming bus.

      Okay. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I literally spent like... three and a half hours searching the internet. Finally I found a website called www.tineye.com/ that is a functional reverse image search engine, meaning you upload an image and it finds other versions of that image all over the internet.. it's supposed to help prevent plagiarism and people stealing your pictures or whatever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
LONG STORY SHORT: <br/> 
 <br/> 
https://images.scaryideas.com/7993.jpg <br/> 
 <br/> 
Upon closer inspection, those two little white things AREN'T the seal's teeth, and therefore the black area is not the inside of his mouth... he's actually a relatively normal looking seal. Which is good because it means he probably lived a long, happy life without a debilitating deformity... but now I feel like... I've spent all this time looking for the picture, and the picture I found wasn't what I thought it was. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm happy for the seal, but sad for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Regardless, mystery solved.

      Amusing, but I can't say I agree with you there. It seems to lack the external, inscrutable, and oppressive force driving the action and treating Teodor's life as meaningless. I mean, Nice Pete really is all of those things, but he's far too personal to really be Kafkaesque. His antagonists are always faceless, indifferently evil forces. They might manifest in the form of a nameless authority figure, but even then it's the impersonal nature that's essential. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In other words, close, but not existential enough.

      hopefully the math teacher is feamle, in fact, my vote is that she's like, one of those japanese cartoon line drawing sort of people, what are they called... anime or whatever...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
my vote is that she's 14 yrs old, and that she cheated to get the math teacher job, she lied about her age, and my vote is that it wasn't sex so much as it was rape, and not just rape, but like, rape and humiliation, like, Michael not so much coerced as brute force forced her onto the desk at the front of the class room, and duct taped her legs down, while all the other students were watching, and invited all the other students to take turns dildoing her, but not with dildos, but like, with highlighters and the stapler and such, and all the other students are giggling 14 yr old girls, and they're all in these really hot bikinis <br/> 
 <br/> 
sometimes when I molest girls I feel guilty because I'm like thinking to myself, this is so wrong, like for instance, if the girl is only 8 years old, I'm like, this is so wrong, this girl would be wayyy more molestable in another year or two or three, and here I am, basically, taking away the opportunity for another child molester somewhere out there, taking away that opportunity permanently, because I mean, sure, you can always remolest a child, but, you can only virinmolest a child once, and really, let's face it, molestation is all about the loss of innocence, sucking it up like a vampire, and so I mean, the only way to get that back would be to have one of those mind wipe devices like they have in the movie Men In Black. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well I do my best, anyway, to wipe her mind, my theory is that if I beat her about the head hard enough so that there's substantial bleeding, not from the sinuses, that's a given, but at least from the ears but preferably the scalp, that there you go, right, she shouldn't remember a damn thing.  I actually found myself recently being more turned on by the head beating more so than the rape/molestation act it's self, so I've had to tone it down a bit, or rather, I mean, wait until I'm sure I'm done with the molestation/rape, and that I'm thoroughly post coital before I start the mind wipe, to make sure I've lost sexual interest.  I don't want to turn into some kind of deviant freak, that's a path to avoid for sure.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I wish to fuck they'd hurry up with the holodeck development.  You know, like some kind of virtual environment where you can rape kids without having to have the guilt/anxiety of wondering if you are raping them too early, and without the fucking mess of the mind wipe.  How many fucking paper towels are we going to throw in land fills before we find a better, more environmentally friendly way, right?  amirite! <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you read this far, congratulations, there was something wrong with you, or if there wasn't, maybe now there is.

      oh come on for shit's sake would it help if it was a prison rape joke?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
A horse and an attractive 8yr old and an undercover cop walk into a bar, and the bartender says "why the long face" and the horse is like "I need some illegal narcotics" and the 8 yr old is like "my brother can hook you up" and the undercover cop immediately arrests and starts molesting the 8yr old and this cheers up the horse who starts laughing.  (prison rape jokes are always funny)  The cop is given a promotion for killing two birds with one stone - getting a narcotics dealer off the streets, and cheering up the horse.

      Hijinks almost always include the element or possibility that harm will come to someone. The difference is that usually as soon as someone comes to harm you stop and either laugh at them, run away, or try to get your stories straight before the cops show up. This all depends on the exact nature of what was done, how injured the person is, and whether or not they did or otherwise caused it to be done to themselves.

      i was fucking running 'round a track in my semi-youth one time and took a shit in my pants as i was rounding the last lap. i skipped into the bathroom to clean up and ended up ditching my underwear in the trash. thankfully no shit got onto my actual pants and i ended up finishing the day (i said it was the last lap but that's not entirely true. i remained out there for some time after my 'incident') holding back tears of shame and embarassment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i've never told anybody that before <br/>

      I once managed to convince my friend that it would be a good idea to take a spin down the road with him on a bike and me running on foot.  We made the first ~9 miles okay but on the return journey I was pulling over to the side of the road and losing it in the woods every hundred yards or so while he waited on his bike.     <br/>

      Nothin' against anyone, but I will never understand how someone between the ages of 6 and 70 can actually shit themselves. That's careless, you know? I mean, I know it can happen pretty easily if you're not thinking about it, but how could you not be thinking about it? It's  <em>shit. In your pants.</em>  I've been in the habit of kinda semi-clinching while farting for as long as I can remember, so horrified have I always been at the prospect of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You can say that this is a weird problem in and of itself. I think there's a lot of potential for comedy in making fun of me for this. But I will always be able to fire back with the fact that I haven't had a load of shit in my pants since about age four. So  <em>there.</em>

      Well, I'm not posting mid-dook or anything, but this little exchange did make remind me of something:  One of the most awesome things in the world has to be when you have yourself a movement, Taco Bell-aided or otherwise, but when you go about your normal cleanup routine the vehicle for said cleanup(paper, leaves, a rabbit's fur, etc.) comes away spotless. <br/>

      San Francisco has them on the street in various locations around town. While some are free a large number are pay. Apparently they see most of their usage as a place to do drugs and various abuses by the homeless. Charging a fee for them has not solved the problem. The best part is that the subway has semi-permanently shut down all of the bathrooms due to "security concerns". Now the proper procedure is to try to track down a station agent and harass them into giving you a free token to go back up onto the street and use the not particularly convenient pay toilet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Apparently we got them from France and while they might work there it is doubtless because they are not populated with Americans.

      Paris' pay toilets work somewhat better than that.  But to compensate they have garbage bags as opposed to cans so that everyone can see when a bomb is dropped in the trash.

      What we have are exactly the small, green, cylindrical  <em>sanisettes</em> . Wherever Paris gets them we must have contracted with as well. Fun fact: we also have news stands that look almost exactly the same! Apparently having giant advertising cylinders as well isn't a coincidence: they're erected by the same company to offset the cost of paying for the toilets which don't earn enough to pay for themselves. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It seems pretty apparent that they were put in not because of any pressing need, but because we wanted to rip off Paris and chose one of the worst ways in which to do so.

He can do anything else to almost anyone who knows him (except maybe Cornelius, who is old), and they will not press charges, because they know he will get out of prison eventually.
