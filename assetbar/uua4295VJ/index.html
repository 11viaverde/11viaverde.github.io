      From Columbia University's Fall 2010 Creative Writing Dept. course bulletin: <br/> <br/> <br/> "CREA W3307x. Fiction Seminar: The Unhinged Narrator. 3 pts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Prerequisites: Please see 612 Lewisohn for registration guidelines or go to https://www.columbia.edu/cu/writing <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some of the greatest works of fiction are narrated by characters who have become unhinged from the norms of society. They may stand apart from the mainstream because of willful eccentricity, madness, even social disgrace, but in each case their alienation provides them with a unique perspective, one that allows the reader to see the world they describe without the dulling lens of convention. We will explore what authors might gain by narrating their works from an "outsider" viewpoint, and we will study how the peculiar form and structure of these books reflects the modernist impulse in literature. This is a seminar designed for fiction writers, so we will spend time talking about not only the artistic merits of these books, but also about how the authors, who include Dostoevsky, Knut Hamsun, Jean Rhys, Denis Johnson, Joy Williams, Samuel Beckett and Amos Tutuola, achieve their specific effects. Over the course of the semester, we will use these texts as a springboard for writing original fiction."

      Could just be that if you said "Johnson, Williams and Beckett" no one would know who you were talking about. But since it says "Samuel Beckett" we know that it is by the inventor of the quantum leap accelerator, someone with a very interesting point of view indeed! He's even been a woman!

      For Teodor's sake I hope so. But on the other hand every foray into the afterlife so far has been superb, so I wouldn't mind another. What I really don't want is for Teodor to end up like Zell and Cory. That would be hard to handle.

      My experience regarding the sweet touch of flame as a thing of intimacy holds that the molotov is not proper, being uncontrollably messy.  More common and more rewarding is to swab an area of the beloved's body with rubbing alcohol being not overly generous so as to avoid pooling.  The irony of the intense cooling sensation immediately before a lit match is pressed against the skin setting it ablaze creates delight within paradox. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, flash paper, as commonly utilized by stage magicians, is another excellent choice, as there is a clear visual sign of where your burning is going to take place when the sweat adheres it to the skin.  It also has the added bonus of requiring less heat to ignite, so rather than a match the motion of snubbing out a lit cigarette against the paper (an act extremely entwined with the mystique of power and dominance) can set it ablaze. <br/>

Nobody gets their rocks off in the back of a van when a repurposed bottle of Eco Domani is brought into play.

      At first I wasn't convinced that this actually happened - but the van speed, the fact that teodor is actually following the action, and the fact that the blinds move are pretty convincing...  The only thing missing is screams, but there are lots of ways to explain that away.  This series has gone mad. <br/> 
Also, the format of this strip is just right for adding extra creepiness.

      I still think that's not entirely clear though - this could easily be Nice Pete's story, and he is telling you that he just drove on into the night, even though the shadows say otherwise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unless you meant to leave out the "not", in which case it's still more evidence that it is happening. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nevertheless, the more I think about this, the more I think that this is one of the few areas where images can tell a story that no amount of description could do justice.  In fact, I'm really curious to see how a literary translation of this would go.  It feels like it would be poe-ish, but would the shadow be described literally as existing and taking action (as I feel like a Poe narrator would do) or would it be more psychological with a description of little more than Nice Pete driving somewhere...  except I guess with details of events being dropped into the subtext without affecting Pete's actual mood until the climax of fire at the end, where suddenly everything becomes clear?  I'm not sure, but I guess the point I'm trying to make is, I really like this strip.

      I was not sure at first, but you have convinced me. The shadow is Nice Pete's physical self and the non-shadow Pete is his inner state. It's a good visual metaphor and, perhaps, a manifestation of the difficulty of drawing a smiling shadow driving a van.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In terms of a literary translation, it depends on who's narrating. Nice Pete would use an honest, Southern style, rich of description. Onstad would be all Nabokov.

      No, no, there are <i>conventions</i> to follow, here. Nice Pete is the third or fourth to die, having never (in retrospect) demonstrably killed someone. Ultimately it turns out Cornelius has been behind the slaughter, and as it turns out his ancient heart cannot withstand the strain as he lays the final cleaver-blow into Roast Beef's head <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then in the next storyline all the characters come back and behave as though nothing notable had happened.

      I remember someone a strip or two ago saying that if Nice Pete killed Teodor, the strip dynamic would have to change violently, but the more I think about it, the more I think it doesn't matter if he dies or not.  With regards to the character interactions, anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It seems like even if he survives this, there is almost no way the rest of the cast can sit idly by in quiet mistrust while Pete carries out living his daily routine.  The topic of the USB Killing Machine came up, and with respect to that, the ending was one of those typical comic back-where-we-started endings.  I mean - in the long shot, achewood tends to take more risks and leave more ends tied in uncomfortable knots, but that one was very tidy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it's time to deal with Pete for good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Additionally, I'd love to see Beef be the hero in this one.  Don't ask me how or why, but I feel like he will be the one to end the cycle of violence.  And of course, it's possible, even probably, that Pete will return from hell...  but his relation with the cast will be forever changed.

      I'm pretty much hoping it stays just between Teodor and Nice Pete. Nearly every storyline is about Roast Beef and/or Ray exploring their own personal quirks, while everyone else just wanders around reacting to Ray and Roast Beef. Teodor and Nice Pete in particular have been stuck just doing their one gimmick (Nice Pete) or whatever the hell minor action is needed to advance the plot (Teodor), and then dissapearing quietly without a fuss. Giving them some story-time to either develop interesting personalities independent of the main characters' egoes or just fucking murder each other brutally is the best thing possible.

      there are not blog posts, exactly. there are narratives about the characters, transcripts of conversations they have, graphic designs Teodor plays around with, etc. It's a lot of the content that would have been blog posts presented in a slightly different form.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
We also get previews of upcoming merchandise/concept art, alternate versions of strips, and general commentary from Mr. O.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're considering signing up, I'd strongly encourage you to do it, at least for a few months. There's over 800 entries so far, starting with a play-by-play of Beef and Molly's wedding. There are two Q&A threads where Chris allowed us to post questions for 24 hours then answered them all as quickly as he could.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The output has dropped from several times a day in the beginning to a few times a week, but I still feel like I get my money's worth out of it. Even just having access to the backlog is worth $3/month.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for Ratacatt's concern, I don't think anyone's been banned at all and there is a fair amount of criticism and disagreement.

      people are banned all the time dude.  in the paid section, any comment that gets three lames gets that account banned for 24 hours.  Every time the comment gets a new lame, the ban period resets to a fresh 24 hours.  So it can easily happen that by someone giving one lame to a comment you made last month, your account is banned for 24 hours. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The effect of this system is that anyone with any slightly unpopular ideas quickly gives up on the place.   <br/>

      Things look a little unstable, but in the grand scheme of things, it will balance out.

      there might be a recession, depression, or even a civil war or two.  Before WWI there were lots of optimists who thought that the wars of Europe were a thing of the past, that a new more sophisticated modern era was upon us... then after WWI the optimists were like "well, it's a good thing we finally got that out of our system.  We're set for good now."  And then whamo, WWII.  When you analyze frequency and distribution of wars on a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101017235421/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">statistical level</a> , you find that statistically speaking, optimism is not warranted...

      Hahaha war against the capitalists, that's great. Let's not even joke here, just off the top of my head I can name a dozen-odd executives who've personally destroyed millions of lives in the most public manner possible, this is not even hyperbole, you don't even have to get into guys like Cassano who just publicly fucked  <em>everybody</em>  for the sheer nihilistic evil of it and were rewarded beyond their wildest dreams. Nothing happened or will happen to any of them, while your life is quantifiably nastier, brutisher, shorter as a consequence of their bullshit the teenage sons of broken men who have lost everything to the vampires think it's radical edgy stuff to even hint in coy terms about how they might hypothetically raise a hand against their masters anonymously over the Internet.  <br/>

      Five years until instability for who? I mean, setting aside that the trouble in the offing right now is pretty much an entirely plutocrat-managed reversion to fascism, it ain't exactly the French Revolution anymore. We've heard this song played plenty of times in the past five decades, whenever some hellhole of a country works up the balls to throw off the yoke its masters just up and move to their Mediterranean villas with 3/4 of the country's assets, get to whoring it up and funding the counterrevolution. I'd say there's hope for a purge in a country with reach like America's but lol even when the American middle class was explicitly placed on the chopping block and it wasn't just the poor and browns anymore not one single person took a shot at a Goldman Sachs exec, dudes can just wander around downtown Manhattan in broad daylight laughing at the cattle. The only destabilizing element in the entire country is underwear bombers i.e. the most obvious CIA false ever(what, the biggest IWF battlefields in the world can't come up with  <em>one</em>  guy who knows how to make a bomb that goes off? Bored American teenagers with MW2 for technical experience do better every day.), and a few of the aforementioned fascist revivalists shooting Jews and crashing planes into tax offices. That's beyond pathetic.

      What if there was a business concern whose most profitable enterprise was loaning money?  To the leaders of both sides in a war.  Do you think it might behoove the operators of that business to make sure that every 50 years or so there is a war?  Not so much to "make sure", as that would be a little too obvious, but more to use the immense wealth and power they had accrued through the years to subtlety influence world politics so as to create opportunities for themselves.  If those "opportunities" result in 5 or 20 million dead people, well, it's not their fault.  They didn't pull any triggers, did they?

The military industrial complex are powerful compared to you and me, but they dare not defy those who hold the purse strings.  In 2010, no business, other than the odd hooker here and there, can operate without borrowed capital.  Government contract for $300M?

      randyleepublic  ...  the world is not as predictable or stable as you believe it to be.  There is no God in the universe, and there is no one person or group who controls the affairs of people.  Some people have more power than others, but the sands are constantly shifting.

      I agree that there is no one person or group.  The sands shift, yes indeed, but the mechanisms of tyranny continue to operate.  How is it that nearly every nation on earth now has a nearly identical monetary system?  Why is it that whenever you read about the problems of monetary systems, the blame for those problems is always fiat money vs. so-called sound money, i.e. gold backed currency, when this is obvious hogwash? <br/> 
 <br/> 
More, it is precisely the unpredictability and instability of the world that serve the powerful so well.  Not the middle management, they hate it, but the truly powerful.  E.G. in the most recent bubble bursting, everyone lost a lot of money, yes.  Well, not quite everyone.  Whoever decided when the bubble was to burst, made a huge amount of money.  Perhaps they didn't make money, but as long as they lost only a little, and their competitors, as well as the mass of humanity, lost much more, then as the cliche goes, it's all good!

      I disagree.  Military power is the ability to motivate millions of individuals to risk their lives carrying out your orders.  It is not done with money, although, of course, money plays a part.  Financial power is the ability to punish and reward a very small group of individuals.  The two are separate.  They are very far from mirror images of each other as in you example of the left and right hand.  They are separate spheres of influence controlled by different rulers.  There is now brain in the middle controlling both arms.  In the past they have even challenged each other, but not for a long time.  Financial power manipulates military power, but does not control it directly.  If I implied that such was the case, I apologize.

      Has anyone mentioned about the extra detail in the art in the first panels? <br/>

After the second read it really helps the reality of the story arc sink in. A detailed picture of a bruised and bloody character simply opening his eyes. So far the story has been a bloody comedy like A League of Gentlemen... only now has it turned into Psychoville.

hey by the way... it could be Pete's imagination that he's tossing a molotov in there, or, it could be that he really did toss a molotov in there, but Onstad is representing Pete as a sort of dichotomy, in that, there is Pete the person, and Pete's shadow...  The last panel demonstrates a connection between Pete and his shadow, yet at the same time, the shadow does sort of have a life of it's own.

      ... which is a pretty good representation of any human being. The man is a psychopath, but he is also just a man, not a diagnosis. Just like all of us he sometimes imagines things he doesn't actually do... and sometimes does things most people imagine he wouldn't. Unfortunately in Pete's case he has far less inhibition on doing what his urges tell him.

      I love the extra detail.  Also, the motor noise.  Notice how it suddenly dims when Pete opens the louvers on the door, and revs back up when he closes them?  Given O's use of onomatopoeia, I have to think this is deliberate--almost as if the sound is actually from T's perspective?   (I'm assuming the sound would reverberate less whenever it had an outlet.)  So not only is the representation of Pete split in two, but the representation of the total scene is split as well, into Pete's perceptions and T's perceptions.

      According to prevalent fantasy tropes, shadow fire only burns shadows.  So Theo and the old man's shadows are destroyed or maimed.  Probably just a nuisance more than anything, maybe like when Bart Simpson sold his soul to Millhouse for five bucks.

      I've thrown Molotov cocktails one time.  Walking home thru a gas station very stoned and very drunk from a party me and my friend saw a guy filling gas into a large bucket.  Naturally we approached him.  His first words as we walked up were 'wanna go throw some molotov cocktails?'.  Of course we said yes, and hopped into the back of his truck.  He drove us to his frat house (NIU) and we went downstairs with him.  They were doing some sort of ritual with the rushers and most of the group objected to us being there. The guy said 'It's cool' and introduced us as Dulger and Chauncy.  We still argue to this day as to who exactly was Dulger and who was Chauncy.  I prefer Dulger.  Anyway we filled up and threw at 4 cocktails at opposing frat houses.  Home by 5.  Good times.

      rminds me of this one time I was at a chineese food restauran an it was full of jews <br/>

anyway long story short, these black guys come in and the chinee guy can't understand them very well and lots of confusion <br/> 
 <br/> 
so I got they order and they got my order, and they come back 5 minutes later and I come back 5 minutes later and we cross paths in the parking lot <br/> 
 <br/> 
and long story short they invite me back to they place <br/> 
 <br/> 
they was blakc panthers <br/> 
 <br/> 
and afterwards we went out an' raped white chicks (this was in the 60s when this was more socially acceptable) <br/> 
 <br/> 
well I am white and they is black so I offered to rape a black chick but they said no it is only the white chicks we got to rape something about turning the tables on the oppressor or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
so I never did get to has sex with a black chick. <br/>

      I think you and I misunderstood this bit: <br/> 
"Our latest strip runs Friday evening, 7/2" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, since he's  <em>said</em>  the strip is going to run on Friday evening, it could hardly be said to be their  <em>latest strip</em>  if it appeared on Friday evening...  It would have to appear some time later.  A lot later, I'm guessing on the order of several weeks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, it's possible he'll give up on this plan to make the next strip be the latest one yet - so we may actually see it "any time now"...

      You just need to recalibrate your watch for the Onstad time zone.  First you synchronize it exactly to a GPS time source - then you adjust it to a week and a half in the past.  Then you set it on the table and smash it with a large hammer.  Then you pick up random bits and pieces and try to arrange them so they form words and numbers.  The first ten times you do this and succeed, you take the parts that were most useful to you in this exercise, carefully store them in a wooden box, which is then shipped to a random location on the Earth.  Finally, on the 21st iteration, if you're able to successfully form the few remaining watch parts into some numbers and letters, and these numbers and letters happen to spell out something roughly like what you thought the time was supposed to be, then you know it's time for a new comic.  If not, then you start the process over again from the beginning.

      Sometimes I wonder how Onstad comes up with his Pat-isms and then I find tidbits like this  <br/> 
"We eat lots of homemade probiotic foods. I found that my gut flora was badly out of balance (as it is for most people that have eaten processed foods) and I needed probiotics to repopulate my gut. They not only boost the health of the beneficial bacteria in the gut, they stimulate digestive juices for better digestion. I make lacto-fermented vegetables (process used to make traditional sauerkraut) from safe veggies and sea salt and eat them daily. I also drink beet kvass and fermented cabbage juice tonic (delicious, I swear!) for natural probiotics. Really easy to make, the varieties are limited only by imagination and no special equipment is required." <br/>

      thank you Randy for articulating what I have been saying for some time now, only your plea for sanity is more succinct and eloquent.  Matter of fact I've said it before also that I think [imgs off] is the best thing that could have happened to assetbar.  not just because of the animated gifs but because yes, a community can only go so far with text when everyone has images constantly distracting them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
personally, I ignore people whose animated avitars annoy me too much.  It's strictly a personal thing as to which avitars are annoying and which are not.  for some reason I got used to i_love_kate's avatar.  That I would have never expected.

      Does anyone else feel that Onstad's relationship with his readership is like that of a feckless, alcoholic husband and his long suffering wife. You're so angry with him while he's away drinking the dole money. Then he comes back, but he's just come in to get his coat, and he gives you some terrible excuse, and he tries to make a joke out of it. You swear you'll never forgive him, but then he turns up, three days later, with a bunch of flowers and presents for the children, and you honestly believe that this time it'll be different, this time he'll stay forever. Any one else feel like that?

      I..  We have a connection here, my friend.  This is true.  I've been checking every five minutes for the new comic, checking e-mail for subscriber update notifications, and waiting..  for some sign that he still loves me.  Anything.  Even if it's just a grunt and a half-asleep rolling-over-and-throwing-his-arm-around-me, I'll take it.. I need it.  Now, more than ever.

      If I didn't give him such a hard time all the time, things would be different. I know it's all my fault. I'm too stubborn, and he works so very, very hard...

      I've developed a theoy. Pete isn't going to kill Teodor. He's just pissed at him for trying to bail on dare night so he's locking him in and making him stay. The molotov shadow is just Nice Pete's imagination venting his anger through fantasy. Hilarity will ensue when Nice Pete opens the back of the van for the next dare (which will involve Ray and Beef) and they will all find Teodor with an old man's 10 inch dong in his mouth. I have to believe this is what will happen, because it is the least disturbing possible outcome my brain has conveived that could result from these circumstances.
