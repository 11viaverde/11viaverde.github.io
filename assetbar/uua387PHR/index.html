      Excessive length of post will also insure a sound laming. This isn't a judgement call. Just an observation. I don't think I've ever lamed falseprophet, but I sure do ignore the hell out of him when he rambles (see 2/5/08, if your lame threshold is high enough).

      Actually falseprophet's question was pretty legitimate. It seems to me that the people who use lames as some sort of personal vendetta are far better candidates for the kind of INTARNETS trolls you describe. Anytime I see a perfectly benign comment lamed up the wazoo, I can't imagine anything other than the same type of pre-adolescent pond scum that inhabit YouTube and such. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I think falseprophet's problem (and mine) is that the tone of his posts, while fairly reasonable and ordinary, doesn't jibe with the insular idiosyncratic one that the regular posters here have developed amongst themselves (along with a latent hostility to anyone who doesn't follow along). So yea, if you actually wanna discuss the strip directly rather than posting post-ironic one-liners or hyperbolic praise of Ray, you're probably better off refraining. <br/>

      Right on. There's a fine line between being chubby and being lame at times, but writing your posts in an unpalatable way will ensure that you end up on the wrong side of it. Come to think of it, dissing Achewood even in a sidelong manner (first post) and lashing out at Assetbar (second post) will do that too.

      I actually did not revert to speaking like Roast Beef to appease the lamers, more to annoy them, because I figured that hidden secretly in a compartment of the lames was derision at some of the posts I have made in the past. But that may be another aspect of my ego taking hold, which I admit I allow to have free reign on the internet like the geeks I expressed anger at earlier. Also, while I did shift into Beef mode, I have decided to start using punctuation to write them again or at least keep them to no longer than four lines if I do that. This may sound like some kind of proclamation from on high, but I don't mean it to be.

      What's fun about your comment is that it comes at the end of a really long discussion expounding upon precisely what it is about which you have no idea, so it reads as if you surveyed the explanations offered and just rejected them out of hand. I recognize that the events of reality do not correspond to my stated record.

      ... <em>so he had long forgotten the</em>  sensation that a glimpse of curved flesh can bring. He started to imagine what it would be like to caress those curves, running his fingers across the smooth young skin and through the rough, tangly body hair. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Suddenly, the sexual charge of the moment was broken by the sound of a small release of air, reminiscent of the sound made when the cap of a bottle of organic ginger ale is gently unscrewed. He was momentarily confused, but that familiar odor soon alerted him to what had happened. As a clean-living organic septuagenarian vegetarian, he knew that fragrance only too well. It was tantalizing to think that this nasal stimulation had emanated from between the soft young peaches, that had already captured his heart. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But he had to think fast. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Did somebody slaughter a cow in here?", he mustered. He correctly guessed that his disapproving tone would indicate his ethically conscious dietary persuasions.

      well, Beef's the only one who's "got" a woman, so... maybe?  And you've got a point about how little Teodor understands women, but I almost think Teodor was saying that Mr. Bear writes women well in the same way you might say that an erotic artist draws women well:  not necessarily realistically... but well.

      Teodor, having not had a girlfriend in a while, does not have the experience to properly criticize Cornelius's romance novel. Cornelius has been transcribing the dialogue of hardcore pornography for so long that he has mistaken the male gaze for the female. <br/>

Whereas Roast Beef is from Circumstances, Cornelius is from Era. Teodor is kind of Fat.

      I don't know, I'm going to have to stick up for Cornelius here.  Just because Teodor doesn't understand what it would mean to write women well, doesn't mean that Cornelius can't do it.  I'm pretty sure that his relationship with Iris Gambol colors his thoughts about women more than a few years of porn transcription.

      Indeed, although I enjoyed Falseprophet's and Spectre's articulate analyses, I think I agree with Earendil. Dime-store romance novels aren't about believable female characters. They require the barest shell of a female, enough for the reader to identify with, and a vividly-described male who is long on superficial characteristics but short on genuine attributes (which the reader might find unappealing). Descriptions of male lust are a major part of these books, as it's what the reader wants to have upon them. Not that I think Harlequin will be releasing this  <em>exact</em>  text...

      I will be honest and say that I don't read romance novels and I don't think I've ever red one, and I am not calling "nerd alert" or its gay equivalent on you if you have read them before, but I always assumed that a romance novel would have the woman as the main character and constantly be mystified by the male, as you describe at first. But then you say that descriptions of male lust are a major part and I would think that is not something you'd read in a novel primarily for females. Of course, that is based on analyses of English teachers who claim that  <em>Jane Eyre</em>  is the literary prototype that was copied over and over again, each one becoming less and less literary and more and more genre, like the dubbed cassette of a '70s album on eight track re-released on CD without being remastered, then made into an mp3 via line-in connection at 128 Kbps joint stereo.

      Hrm. I'm not sure I buy that; I think of Austen more as the great-grandmammy of the sit-com (I haven't read  <em>Jane Eyre</em>  so if it's significantly different from P&P and S&S please disregard my comments). Austen wasn't straight fantasy--it's kind of more in line with Shakespearean comedy, though certainly targeted at female readers. Romance novels can get rather bloodier, and are not targeted at virgins, though not targeted at people who have healthy sex lives, either. And yeah, I've read a few, and as with all such things YMMV.

      Austen's books were romance novels/social commentary on the catty, meaningless lives of many of the women in her era. romance novels, on the other hand, are escapist fantasies that are about as two dimensional as a Thomas Kinkaid painting. They follow a fixed formula, which goes petty much as follows: <br/> 
Girl, in her twenties, impetuous, stunningly beautiful, and coldhearted, meets boy, also in his twenties, who is incredibly talented at something, bitter about the opposite sex, and has long, flowing hair. The two are thrown together for an extended period of time and initially hate each other. Then, lust overwhelms and they "make love." There are lots of turgid members and heaving bosoms. Blah blah blah they get married. It is sad.

      Interesting. Whatever the lineage of descent, I think it's key to realise that in Jane Eyre, Jane is a very strong female character, and is much stronger than any other. Also, she does not seek male lust. Thus, if the description of the dimestore romance novel is correct, it has kind of flipped around, and become the opposite of Jane Eyre. <br/>

Jane is sassy.

      "Jane Eyre as transcendantal type of female power: we see that she can cross all boundaries, of space, time, class, and even divinity in her struggle with the rector who invites her to india, and in that resistance even to resist Jaganath himself. There is no evidence in Bronte's writing that Jane is intended to be bounded in time or space, let alone material composition."

      romance novel heroines are sassy. ALL of them. I think they took some of the basic elements of Austin and Bronte's plots and cheapened them with too many adverbs, like "throbbing," "heaving," and "swollen." Interestingly enough, in both genres, the inevitable end result is marriage. Plus, most heroines of romance novels start out strong and independent, but eventually their attraction to the male lead makes them realize that all they want is to be taken care of. You know, cave-man style. rough lovin and a warm body next tio you at night. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 In my defense, I was that savvy undergrad. I wrote so much on this shit in feminist lit classes that I still remember it all. Plus, the research.......so much Danielle Steele.......shoot me now.  <br/>

      I am beginning to realize that maybe there is something about not being able to chubby people indefinitely that actually brings people together on Assetbar. So many times I have participated in and been a party to a proxy-chubby for people who have run out. It is such a nice warm thing and is so different from other web 2.0s of low mind I have come across. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Assetbar is a loving hippie commune that somehow runs on trickle down economics, straight bringing people together. It is like Barack Obama if he were a web site.

      The thing is, the idea of organic food is great, but "organic" has become a label that supermarkets can stick on food without having to stick to any definition of the word - if you don't know what definition of organic they are using, the only thing you can definitely say about it is that it's more expensive.  <br/>

      These are Good Questions. I tend to think that if there were marshmallows, I would be inclined to replace the pectorally-enhanced dude with Mr. Sta-Puft. Perhaps another time. <br/>

I was also toying with the idea of having KISS in the background, but I felt this was off the point, as well as considerations for the professional level of Cornelius' work. <br/>

What's with the copy at the top, though? "...all harbor passions.."? I think I meant "all of us." Perhaps Skradley or Rowboat should do all my copy instead, as I'm just a silly art dork.

      That's a fun sentence. You can play around with it and make it  <em>almost</em>  work in myriad ways. I think all  passions produce harbors. I think all passions harbor produce.

Actually you can dis on it if you want, but I associate Esperanto with one of my past neighbors, a linguist who drank wine and played folk guitar.  His roommates were Mormon Jocks. <br/>

      Esperanto is so early twentieth century, Interlingua is the wave of the future for geeky linguist types.  It uses the most widely used word from a group of control languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese, with Russian and German as secondaries) to express a concept,such as automobile (english: automobile, french: automobile, spanish: automovil, portuguese: automovel, etc.).  It has no grammatic rules or verb tenses that don't occur in all of the control languages, i.e. no progressive verb tenses because they don't occur in French, no definite articles because they don't occur in Russian, etc.  Words originated from languages other than the controls are sometimes accepted, but only if their use in the controls demonstrates internationality (samurai from Japanese, etc.).  It has simple grammar rules with no exceptions.  Even for speakers of non-European languages, the simple vocabulary and grammar makes it a very easy language to learn.  It is wuite possibly the closest anyone has ever come to creating a perfect language.

      How does this pose a problem? <br/> 
The point of not using certain verb tenses and speech parts is to get rid of unnecessary, potentially confusing, words.  It is difficult to explain progressive tenses to a native French speaker, or definite articles to someone who speaks Russian, but when you really think about it, they are both unnecessary.  We just think they are important because we are used to them and don't know how not to use them.  By removing unnecessary parts of speech, the language is simplified, therefore easier to learn.  You can't write off an entire language based on inability to express concepts in the manner that you have grown used to.  As for Chinese, you might want to learn some, since their actions over the next few decades may very well determine the economic and political future of the world.

      There is no way to make a language that will confuse noone.  The idea behind a constructed international language is to make it the least confusing to the most possible people.  And I am speaking solely of diplomats, not population in general, so the fact that China has 20% of the world's population means nothing here.  Esperanto, Ido, Interlingua, etc. came out of the idea of an international language for business and politics, and since the nations with the most economic and political power are either European or speak European languages, it makes sense for the control languages to be European.  It's not euro-centric, it's practical.

      https://orezscu.blogspot.com/2007_01_01_archive.html that's the Teodor post; he says Whole Foods, which implies it's a different girl. However, he DOES mention the armpit hair, so either Chris made a mistake when he meant to connect the two, or it's not connected and we're simply reinforcing that girls who work at hoity-toity supermarkets don't shave 'em.

      same, but that might have fit better with the magical realism strips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
actually, i don't know if that book is magical realism, I am reading marquez's 100 Years of Solitude and it is so i assumed Love in the Time of Cholera was as well

      I wonder...what are MENSA's thoughts on Cornelius writing smut between his lectures? <br/>

I'm told MENSA views eroticism as unnecessary and deistracting, regardless of the involvement of organic foods.

      I'm disappointed this one isn't near a 5 anymore. The completely deluded reaction Téodor gives in panel 6 is misguided, and that's the joke. I wonder if people down-voted this comic because they think we're supposed to agree with him...

      4.2 is still high. I guess a lot of people voted 4. Although it is funny, sometimes voting 5 all the time simply detracts from the  <em>really</em>  funny ones.

      I agree. A ridiculous amount of the people who frequent this assetbar vote like 80-90% of the strips a 5, making the rating system hella ceiling effected. The fact that morypcaina thought that a 4.2 was disappointing, and the general trend of ratings I've seen around here suggests to me that you guys wouldn't know a Gaussian distribution if it kicked you in the rad chillies.

      I think what actually happens is the majority of people who vote fall into about a 5-to-1 ratio of people who vote five every time because they're totally crazy about achewood, to people who vote one anytime a strip isn't spectacular because they're jerks, and the rest of the people just don't vote at all and we get this sort of average

      I'm going to have to side with Moolah.  I think we all know that Achewood is awesome, so anything less than a 5 is not insulting, it's merely not THE BEST.  But eh.  The scale could be 1-20 and everyone would still be like "WTF WHY IS THIS A 19.7 GUYS COME ON."  (I blame my current enrollment in a Stats class)

      For all of you non-mathematicians out there, "Gaussian Distribution" is how a pretentious statistician says "bell curve".  I don't know the exact figure, but I'm going to guess that 99.7% of the strips fall between 3.6 and 4.8(not sure about this, but I've only seen 2 or 3 below 3.6, and maybe only 2 4.9s) , giving us a mean of 4.2 and a standard deviation of .2.  This means that 65% of all the strips are rated between 4.0 and 4.4 (within 1 standard deviation of the mean), 95% are between 3.8 and 4.6 (within 2 standard deviations), and 99.7% are between 3.6 and 4.2 (within 3 standard deviations of the mean).  This is, of course, assuming normal distribution, and I don't have the numbers on hand to determine whether or not that is the case.
