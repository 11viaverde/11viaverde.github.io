      Though it has rarely been acknowledged by the fanbase, Ray's early characterization is as a very intimidating sort of person. His later feats are less surprising in this light.

      Straight up to you. One of my favourite parts about Achewood is that all the characters are portrayed in both positive and negative lights. It makes them feel so much more real. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray is one of the best for this. So is Cornelius. And Teodor.

      Yeah, I think one of the reasons everyone was complaining so much about Achewood "sucking" last year was that there were like three storyarcs in a row where the only message was "look how cool/badass this character is" (Cornelius and Polly spring to mind). Todd arcs, of course, never have this problem, as it is impossible to portray Todd in a positive light.

      It's kind of self-righteous of him to quit the show because it offended him, after South Park offended countless bazillions of others.  <br/>

In conclusion, Ray is much cooler than Isaac Hayes.

      Guys, as a scientologist, I am very offended by this. My fellow scientologists keep telling me to quit achewood, and they won't listen when I tell them it's not a job and I need to Dianitize my thetans. Anyway, I'm leaving! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, the only Scientologist I ever knew was my friends dad, who yelled at us all because we were talking about Scientology like it may or may not be valid. I was actually playing the devil's advocate, saying it could be valid, yet he chose me for his zealous rantings. He told me I was and idiot with a small vocabulary, and tried to convince me that Scientology would cure me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He also called "the world's only white nigger" and asked my friend why he was hanging out with a white nigger.

      Ray is not a cat who thinks things through.  Ray is a cat who buys olives based on some kind of dice voodoo, and has a cool-sounding reason why he is out of olives but really it was because he did poorly at craps last night and although he could buy more olives he is ashamed to do so.

      The joke is that Teodor knows nothing about martinis, or alcoholic drinks at all. He is completely bluffing (and honestly, we've all been there). <br/>

Normally, either an olive or a twist of lemon would be considered acceptable.

      Early Achewood Ray is intimidating and if he didn't like you he would have called you a fancy man if you wanted a twist, but if you had said you wanted an olive he would have accused you of being of low class.  If 2002 Ray doesn't like you, there are no right answers.
