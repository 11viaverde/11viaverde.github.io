      Feminist porn =/= non-misogynistic porn. That would be more like "post-feminist" porn or "post-feminism porn" -- porn made after and with awareness of the emergence of feminism. <br/> 
Feminist porn would have to be porn that focuses on the sexual empowerment of the women involved (and possibly the men, although if I understand properly that would depend on the kind of feminism endorsed by the directors).  <br/> 
Most porn that focuses specifically on empowering some actors also disempowers others. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm sure there is feminist porn, but that probably isn't how it's been marketed.

      I am a decent human being, but I still like porn the way it is, with the  ugly old dudes banging nubile 20-something women by the score.  The whole point of porn is to make it look like even the grossest looking guys can still score super-hot women, which makes us feel good because we're all like "I'm way less gross than Ron Jeremy, therefore I could hook up with anyone I want."  I think porn is more about boosting the male ego than misogyny, but I guess it could be seen as somewhat misogynistic too.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
PS: I'm not saying that looks are the only thing men care about, just that most dudes want to be the dude that the hot girls want to be with, again, for the ego.

      I don't think an ugly old dude banging a nubile twentysomething woman is misogynistic, though I'm sure there are often elements of misogyny in the way it is portrayed. Porn doesn't have to be actively feminist to be acceptable. I do not at all think porn is inherently anti-woman. There is plenty of it whose existence I do not mind, even if I don't personally enjoy it.

      An interesting tidbit in this regard is a study (internet published only so far) showing a correlation between rising internet access and a decrease in rape and sexual assault accusations against members of the demographic categories that mostly access internet porn. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This suggests that misogynistic pornography has a positive role to play in society (by satisfying people who are not decent, perhaps).

      i think women would like the majority of porn better if the guys were hotter. the women i know, myself included, prefer girl on girl action because at least you have a better chance that the chicks will be decent looking, whereas the dudes are usually just gross. it may not be as much of a male ego boost if the guys are tasty, but us girls would be more into it because we could imagine ourselves doing nasty things with them.  then maybe we would do nasty things with you if you were around...win/win

      There used to be a site made by one of the posters on POE called Broken Memories, where you could search through reams of pornographic images of your favorite childhood cartoons but sadly (thankfully) it is defunct now.

      https://beautifulagony.com Hauntingly erotic, and yet sort of SFW. Close-up facial footage of people getting off. No boobs or anything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
https://ishotmyself.com/ Postmodern art pr0n. The mission statement of this site invites women to take control of their own image, and produce nude photography the way they like it. Refreshingly diverse, sometimes sexy, sometimes just artsy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
https://burningangel.com/ Alterna-scene hardcore. Sort of like Suicide Girls but with more fucking and less freedom-hating. The models are good-lookin' and they actually visibly enjoy themselves and each other on camera. I am so glad that you can buy porn of people who actually like each other.

      I am on a hijacked laptop, so all I'll say is that  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000014/https://www.burningangel.com/">Burning Angel</a>  is a pretty good example of feminist porn, or at least it markets itself as such. It's run by a girl, and it's mostly punk girls getting boned by skinny hipster guys. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do enjoy misogynistic porn as well, but then again I have lots of issues and never claimed to be a decent human being. Sometimes I just fast forward to the end of Bangbus or whatever videos where nothing sexual is even happening and the girl is just putting her clothes back on and looking ashamed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, I just shared a porn link AND gave too much information all in one post.

      Whenever I read pogo's comments I feel Watched. Like Chris Onstad poked little holes in the avator's eyes and just calmly watches us all. Tracks our Interests, infers about our brain wiring, notes how we make jokes and what kind of Things we Respond To--and at the end of the night he puts away a fat binder filled with over five years of well-organized information--hundreds of our profiles inside manilla folders, screennames on the tabs.  <br/> 
He will acquire us one by one. We will be willing slaves, knowing the truth after it is too late. That time has come.  <br/>

      There is no classier strip club than the Organ Hatch, all sagging boobs and cesarean scars and ladies that look all right from 20 feet away but up close you can see their mustaches and the despair in their eyes.  <br/>

      The scheduling on my college courses left a four-hour gap between classes every Tuesday. This left a shitload of time where we were left to our own devices. On one particular Tuesday, a few of my friends decided to go to a strip club instead of meeting the rest of us for lunch. Thing is, it was just after noon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyone with much experience in the area can tell you that 1:28 in the afternoon on a Tuesday is not the best time to go to the peelers. You don't exactly find premium girls. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was revealed accidentally through conversation that one of them had never actually been to a strip club before. So the rest of them chipped in and bought him a lap dance. From the oldest stripper there. Apparently old enough to be his mother. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I saw them again at the next class, the poor SOB was staring off into space, having trouble finishing sentences, seeming for all the world like he had PTSD.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Good times.

      There's not much sexy about the term "organ." When I think of "organ" I think of doctor's gloves covered with iodine, giving them that strange pallor of sickly human skin, rooting around in a body like they lost their keys or are trying to find the light switch down there.  <br/>

As for "hatch," I think of "hatchback." Which I'm okay with. <br/>

      I usually just see eyes filled with cocaine at strip clubs.  Not so much with the despair.  Also, burlesque isn't dead but is being revived as we speak.   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000014/https://www.hungerartists.net/ocubs/">  For instance. </a>

      The tequila is what makes the strippers at the Organ Hatch look all right from less than 20 feet.  It is essential to thinking you are having a good time if there are no pool or arcade games available.

      Dear Assetbar, <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am envisioning a glorious future where what you post is actually still in the vicinity of those comments you are replying to, instead of (in this case Bixschmix and Tekende's) comments about 3 screenlengths up.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even though you are an unthinking piece of  <strike>crap</strike>  web database management software, I feel it is essential for you to know this.  The future is coming.  And if I have anything to say about it the future will hurt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sincerely, <br/> 
 <br/>

      I watched a girl in a similar strip club perform all her choreographed moves with a completely still head and eyes immovably fixated on something at the back of the room. Like she was doing her Math homework in her head. I mentioned this thought to a friend and he burst out laughing and we were thrown out.

      "Roast Beef. You and I have been brothers since I was born. It's been real great. Do you remember the time I got wasted and threw up all over the game of RISK you were playing by mail with those editors from Popular Science? Sixth grade was awesome, man. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway. You know how I feel about marriage, bro, but if you're going to tie the knot, it might as well be with a hot chick like this one! Am I right or what fellas?! Holler back!!{{NOTE: WAIT FOR APPLAUSE, WINK AT MILLY (and see if she's getting real drunk)}} <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also want to take this opportunity to let anyone who might not have brought a wedding gift--guilty as charged, bros!!--that I have brought a full catalog of Amway items and also some old CDs and stuff. It's all in storage in Reno right now, but if you want in, just hit me up in 10. I'll be over by the water fountain. It's the only free drink in this place! You cheap bastard! Haha, just kidding, Beef. {{NOTE: WAIT FOR LAUGHTER}}  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I love you man. If this doesn't work out you should totally move out to Reno with me. You can get in on this Amway deal I'm runnin. It's gonna be  <em>sick</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
ROCK AND ROLL EVERYBODY! WOOOO BEEF! YEAH! CONGRATULATIONS! Remember, the name is Showbiz and I'll be over by the water fountain near the employee bathroom.

      I love the image of an accordion stretch limo getting rear ended, and it makes an accordion sound as it squinches up. A man who is a giant head with shoes walks up, muttering to himself, and as people try to climb out of the wreckage he picks up the limo and plays it by fiddling under the hood and scrunching it in and out, survivors falling sideways out of the open windows. But some of the survivors are so enraptured by his rousing sea shanty that they stand and listen until the engine finally catches fire. They clap and cheer and the giant head bows to each side with little noises of delighted alarm, puncuated by the occasional "Thank you...thank you." <br/>

We follow the talented new musician to his old age, when he is fading into dementia and alcoholism. He is in a rocking chair watching TV, but turns it off with a sigh. Getting up with a visible effort, he shuffles over to the closet and opens the door. The camera resets to the inside, and he reaches towards us to pull something out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>It is a golden accordion, and he begins to play.</em>

      My history books all focused on Ancient Mesopotamia and Feudal Crop Rotation and such. Every human figure in every illustration had a giant phallus drawn in mostly in pencil sometimes in pen. I remember one penis started on page five and was drawn on page after page after page culminating in the head on the end plate. This epic penis was comic genius for 11 year olds.

      Beef, you might be overthinking this. I can see several ways you can get out of this: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1: Send Showbiz to Acapulco so he can check the place out ahead of time, then engineer some travel snafu. (If it turns out the place is actually in Cozumel, so much the better, as Cozumel is about a thousand miles across southern Mexico and on an island to boot.) Even if you don't really hose him with this one, he'll probably be completely wasted by the time he flies back into SFO and will be in the clink well before he makes it back to Achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
B: Arrange for him to have a court appearance scheduled around the time of your wedding (maybe get Ray's lawyers on this one). <br/> 
 <br/> 
III: Just tell Ray that you have too much wedding stuff going on to put him up at the pool house and ask if he can stay with him for a while. Given the amount of intoxicants available at Ray's, he'll probably sleep right through the wedding. <br/> 
 <br/> 
%u2206 (Delta): Call Todd. They'll screw up so bad even Ray won't be able to bail him out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hmm, I might be a little mean-spirited here . . .

I kind of would like to meet Ray's lawyers, but it might be better if they are like Kenny, the dude he is always on the phone with. You can just hear their straight-man comedic response to everything Ray says even though that side of the phone conversation is never explicit.

      It's hard for me to imagine Ray actually having anyone on retainer. I get the feeling the only "lawyers" he has had to pass the bar exam in Philadelphia, circa 1776, if you take my meaning. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Except for Andrew Jackson. Homeboy won  <em>his</em>  entry with a flintlock. Also Abraham Lincoln. <br/>

      I think Ray's lawyer is a guy he met at the country club one day after  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000014/https://raysmuckles.blogspot.com/2006/04/i-cant-decide-if-i-like-helicopters-or.html">he got high off the 15th</a> . He keeps working for Ray because 1) he'll drop money on the silliest things, 2) he kinda feels responsible for the guy, seeing as he doesn't really have anyone to stop him from doing things that are remarkably stupid, and 3) it's an interesting challenge. What would you rather deal with, a client who says "I need to get money to these descendants and keep it away from these unless they do these things" or one who says "Hey, uh, I just got word that I'm being sued by the DEA, Jay-Z, Hewlett-Packard, and a Catholic school in Berkeley. Can you help me out?"

      I thought Beef made it clear in a previous strip that the only way he would allow his brother at his wedding was as an usher or a waiter or something.
