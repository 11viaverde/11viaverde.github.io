      You endorse cloves and Marlboro's in your profile, and then have the nerve to shit on Camels? I must call shenanigans. However, your posts are usually pretty reasonable, and I like your avatar, so I'll let you off with a warning this time.

      I enjoy marloboros because when i was younger, and a smoker (i quit after getting braces), those were really the only thing available. I have sort of the same thing with butter: i was raised on margarine, so butter always tastes a little  <em>off</em>  to me. I know i am probably a wrong person.

      I went on down to Conjunction Junction yesterday because I received a postcard in the mail with no mailing address that said "Do you know your function?" When I got there, I saw a girl in track pants and no top holding herself in the cold so that Jack Frost could not see her hardened nipples and as I approached her, I saw the words that described her wafting out of my mouth in the fog. I only got to word number eleven, and it was "slender." It was like The Electric Company but without the  disco. I said to her as I put my hands on her shoulders "There's no use, you're not going to find love here." She turned around and let her arms down and said "This was brought to you by the letter V." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I blinked and we were fucking on top of a mountain, and every few thrusts or so, I would ask her a question like "So are you in school right now?" or "How long have you been living in the city?" or "What's your major?" but she just kept staring at me without blinking. We went down from the mountain and into her house and I lived there with her until the baby was born. It was a boy and we named him Craig. I looked at her again and she said, "There's three in the family." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"'Cause it's a magic number," I replied. And that was the twelfth word. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A man and a woman had a little baby.

      I worked in an actuarial department for a year. Enough to put me off smoking for life. The only three factors used for life expectancy calculations on a big scale (all their policy holders, basically), were age, gender, and whether or not they smoked.

      This one makes me sad, but not in such a bad way.  It's cool the way the characters develop in such a way that you can feel disappointed about things like young Téodor breaking his dad's heart.

      honestly, this is not my favorite strip. Nice Pete sounds way too Roast Beef-like here - and it's not just that Onstad was still developing his voice, since Pete's voice still hasn't changed much from his first strips. I guess he just had trouble getting into character. <br/>
