      It's possible.  Not to mention whatever the hell else Nolan looks up.   <strong>Tigers giving birth and shit.</strong> * <br/> 
 <br/> 
But also - why would he have to bury it?  It's a diskette, you can just break it or burn it or something  <em>why in the hell am I picking this story apart I feel less of a man</em> <br/> <br/> <br/> *Oh sweet damn I just had an image of Lyle giving birth.  We can all imagine it.  He has a bottle of Jack in hand, and he's possibly throwing up at the same time.

      I have noticed this trend.  I've gotten chubbies for my "v-chub" posts, which doesn't make any sense at all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Late at night, I lie awake, and wonder if I should change my avatar.  I know it's earning me chubbies that  <em>I don't deserve.</em>   But... but... maybe I earned all of those chubbies by picking the right avatar?  I toss and turn, but in the end, I simply love the PNDT too much to change my avatar. <br/>

But maybe I've gotten another account so I can travel through assetbar, posting comments unnoticed and unchubbied.  Maybe...

      I've personally often wondered if Onstad himself has an anonymous account so as to intermingle with us.  It's possible, but I hope not for his sake.  I really hope he doesn't read the individual things we say at  <strong>all</strong> .  That's exactly the sorta thing to throw you off your game. <br/>

By writing this, I've pretty much solidified that I'm not Onstad in disguise.  Or was it a double-fake to make you  <em>think</em>  that....?

I just want to be clear on that point before somebody makes a play on words from a faulty foundation, e.g. "you're right, he really should have used his heads," when what they should be going for is something more on the order of "all those lames--he's really losing a lot of face."

      Your sentences are songs sung in the key of lie. Have you no curiosity? What if everyone's just been lying to you and it's actually like the best porno you'll ever see, with the rudest titties? You cannot afford to take that risk. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for lemonparty, all that requires is a quick google image search. You'll know it when you see it. Or you could just go to the site. I won't link to it here, but let's just say the domain name is straightforward, and it is apparently a nonprofit organization. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also forgot to mention Goatse and Harlequin Fetus. I tend to think knowledge is always better than ignorance no matter what the subject, and I've yet to come across anything that I actually wished I hadn't seen.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is an exception though, which is videos of animal cruelty. My girlfriend tried to send me that video of the Chinese woman stomping on a kitten with high heels (she watched a minute of it before stopping), but I tried to forget the very thought. Videos of cruelty to humans don't bother me as much for some reason, I think because there's always the possibility that it's an act or at the very least one has seen similar kinds of stuff acted out in movies.

      AchillesElbow, I gave you a chubby because we are internet twins. I feel the exact same way as you, shock pictures have never had much of an effect on me. After watching 2 girls 1 cup i was able to eat dinner, and I've seen goatse/tubgirl/lemonparty so many times I laugh when I see them. People have told me I'm fucked up for not thinking the pictures are gross, but I'm not fucked up. It just doesn't bother me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But what bothers me? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Animal cruelty. Zippocat nauseates me, and I do not even DARE touch the heelstomp video. Cats especially get to me, as I'm a cat person. I still feel bad for the dogs though. As far as human cruelty/gore... i've laughed at a picture of a guy whose face was hanging off due to a shotgun blast, the picture itself superimposed with the words "I LOL'D." <br/>

High five for being desensitized dicks (and a pat on the back for me, since i basically just reworded your post)

      I really didn't need to know about Zippocat, but ok. I think this dichotomy might be a common thing, because now that I think of it, there are more logical reasons. With the footage of people being executed or having their heads blown off, this is something that usually occurred on its own and was then documented by a third party, whereas with the animal videos, it was someone doing that just for the sake of taping it. Maybe I would be equally bothered by a snuff film that I definitely knew to be real, but I haven't tested this theory and have no particular desire to.

Here is this girl with some super-rare condition that gives her two faces.  And in her culture she is revered because she is seen as a reincarnation of the goddess Durga.  She will live a life of ease and adulation, not like the life of Joseph Merrick. <br/>

It frankly never occurred to me that people would be creeped out by the picture.  The short-sightedness of that is clear to me now, thus the decision to remove the picture.  (that, and the fact that I created the situation in such a way that I could change the picture.)

      I want to know what possessed the Shrovis-Bishopthorpe engineers to install a 5-1/4" floppy drive in their laptop. Did they think to install USB ports? Where do you even buy 5-1/4" floppy diskettes these days? Where  is the strip that has Cornelius asking Roast Beef for a 5-1/4" diskette? Because the only person in the neightbourhood likely to still have a few tucked away would be Roat Beef? Why would Mr. Teal request such a diskette rather than a USB thumb drive? <br/> 
 <br/> 
How could the Publican fit onto a 5-1/4" floppy? Exactly how much kiddie porn could you fit onto such a diskette? <br/>

i think i remember 5-1/4" capacity being less than the hard-case floppy. <br/>

technology-related story-- <br/> 
my old IBM 386 had both floppy drives (and a 4x Sound Blaster CD Drive!) and was the replacement for our Tandy. we still have the Tandy's screen, which weighs a kabillion pounds and though it requires you to position such as a writing utensil in its power switch, it still works great. the colors are sharp and contrast superb.

      The first 5-1/4" floppy drive could hold 98.5 KB per disk, later increased to 110 KB, and eventually 360 KB with the first "double density" drives by 1978.  In the early '80s, the first "quad density" drives were created, enabling the storage of 720 KB per disk.  In 1984, the first high-density disks were created, enabling the storage of an astounding 1200 KB of information, which was quite a lot, considering that hard drives at the time averaged 10-20 MB.

      Answer depends on the size of the oranges.  are we talking tangelos or navel oranges? <br/>

nevertheless, i can assure you that the number of oranges shall always be less than the number of lemons, due to the Greater Cornelian Citrus Fruit Reference.

      (I'm so sorry about this)  It's even more difficult than that.  It really depends on the sphere packing solution of the lemons relative to the oranges.  Since they are clearly not uniform (nor perfectly spherical), a straightforward lattice approach would fail miserably, and the old hexagonal method wouldn't be optimal either.  It is an unsolved problem in mathematics as to how many oranges you could fit into an n-lemon condom.

      I bet when he goes shopping or just out in public most people must flip the fuck out, all assuming he's there to bust them for something they didn't do. He goes to buy a sandwich and the sandwich vendor begins shrieking, "No! No, Mr. Hansen, I don't lust after little kid asses! No!" and stumbles out the back and starts sprinting away.

      Everyone involved in that show should be shamed to death.  I feel dirty just flipping past it on the TV.  That Chris Hansen is such a disgusting little turd; why he hasn't hung himself out of shame boggles the mind.  Everyone featured on it, either on camera or behind the camera, so to speak, is loathsome.  It makes me ill to think that people find entertaining an hour of sickening idiots entrapping other sickening idiots into making repulsive fantasies real.

      true - hell the Achewood strip it's self is sometimes surreal, fantastic, and dystopian in a fashion reminiscent of La Cité Des Enfants Perdus.  We assetbar users are perhaps like so many brains trapped in a jar, a jerry-rigged ASCII connection our only desperate light in an otherwise obscure existence, trapped in some maniacal artist's sinister plot to extract the seeds of our creativity...

      Firstly, my feelings on the strip:  Oh  <em>Hell</em>  no.  Tell me that didn't happen.  I'm really enjoying this arc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Secondly, on finally catching up to the real date: <br/> 
 <br/> 
I always do this.  Once a strip has penetrated the mush that I call a brain enough for me to actually pay attention to it, I go back and read the archives from the beginning. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This time though it was a little different, thanks to a lil' thing called Assetbar.  I usually ignore forums about comics, mainly because they're a click away and not visible on the same page. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But dammit, y'all are right there.   <em><strong>Right there, man.</strong></em>   So I start reading. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A virtual year later (about 2 weeks real time) I register an account and go back through what I've read, simply to deliver chubbies and lames.  That's all I'm doing.  That's all I'm going to do, I tell myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then, of course, slowly I start posting.  Sure, I'm 7 months behind everyone else and no one will read the damn things, but I'm posting regardless. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The intelligence of the average Achewood poster (or at least the regulars - you know who you are) is enough to draw me in again and again, not couting the few idiots out there ( <em>you</em>  don't know who you are, but everyone else does and mocks you terribly for it, much to the enjoyment of the rest of us). <br/> 
 <br/> 
So now at the end of it the Achewood experience isn't complete unless I flip through Assetbar to see what people have posted.  And since the comments have averaged about 500 since the beginning of this year, that%u2019s made the last 3-4 months go  <em>Hell of slow</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways I feel like I know you, and you don%u2019t know who the hell I am.  That  <em>may</em>  change.  But I thought you people should know that now you all are a part of the zeitgeist of Achewood to me.   <strong>This is a thing.</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thank you for your time, and I doubt I%u2019ll be this long or this nice to everyone again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>  This long, fawning spam is directed to the people using Assetbar, and in no way towards the actual Assetbar itself.  Preemptively anticipating Assetbar turning my BBcode to hash, I will say now what others have said before:  <strong>Screw you Assetbar.  Fuck you.</strong></em>

      Yeah man, I'm re-reading the archives right now, and reading the comments for every strip, so if anyone's still posting, I'll see it and have an opinion on it, and maybe, if you're really lucky, even reply to it.

      I remember that the only reason I got an account was because I was curious as to what Asherdan's lamed out posts read. Having initially complained about the lame/censorship system, I have slowly realized that this is all part of Assetbar's plan to draw in more people. Also, for someone who planned to destroy Assetbar in favor of the old messageboard, Asherdan has indirectly drawn more users than he could have imagined. How delightfully ironic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, welcome.

      I am drawn to the comments almost as much as the strip itself. I'm  <em>trying</em>  to catch up with the comments of 'yore, but it's slow going. <br/> 
I've also found myself boning up on my Photoshop skills just to make silly jokes for the regulars, waiting with terrified expectation to see if I made someone,  <em>anyone</em>  laugh, like  <strong>SO</strong>  many of these people have made me laugh. (I wonder if this could translate to 'graphic design' credits for night school...) <br/> 
It's a silly little thing, but it's a group of very diverse individuals, with VERY disparate backgrounds.  It's simultaneously my closest group of high school friends AND a virtual Benetton of tastes/experiences/backgrounds... <br/>

...and oh fuck I'm gushing.  Bloody wanker.   <br/>

      Not all floppy drives are like the ones on these  fancy, new-fangled 486s, with the 133 MHz processor and 4 MB of ram. Latch-type mechanisms were standard on  5.25" floppy drives, such as would use the style diskette that Cornelius is burying.  You would place the diskette into the slot, then flip a switch or latch mechanism to actually move the motor and reading equipment up to the disk, holding it in place and allowing the drive to read it.
