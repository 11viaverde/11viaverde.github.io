      I see as like arguing who is more man, a MMA champion or a hardened Special Forces veteran. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Throw them in a ring together, with rules and a referee, odds are extremely likely the MMA man will come out on top, for he is in the controlled element, ultimately just a game, in which he has specialized. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Reverse the situation, and drop the MMA guy naked into the wilderness, and he will likely be dead within a week. Drop him into a fire fight, and he will probably stand paralyzed with fear until he is cut down. Put him into hand-to-hand combat in an Afghani hovel, and his attempts to beat the other man into submission will be cut short when his enemy gouges out his eyes or caves in his skull with an improvised weapon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray proved himself the best man at the GOF. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cornelius proved himself the best man at  <em>life</em> .

      I still refuse to believe that the people in the show are actually undergoing all of that. They MIGHT be in the location claimed, I'll concede that is a possibility. But they are most certainly not starving and dirty. There's no doubt in my mind that they are provided plenty of food, water, a shower, a bed, etc.

      Just for perspective, when this strip was written, that would have been Jenna Morasca who won Survivor, famous for being extremely mean to a deaf girl and stripping for peanut butter.

      i like the point of the diminutive size of the characters as ray dismounts from the couch and has to look up at cornelius.  such small characters having such sass is hella comedy.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
however, this aspect of the achewood reality seems sometimes  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231062858/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=04292004">flexible</a> . (unless there are cat-sized grills and telephones and martini glasses in achewood, which is entirely probable.  maybe this particular couch is human-sized because ray is visiting cornelius at the onstad residence.  or maybe i'm thinking about this far too hard.)

That glare actually raised Corny's eyebrows. <br/>

Also, I'd like to point out (as someone already has) that these are  <em>cats</em>  sitting on a human-proportioned couch, so in that second-to-last panel, Ray is  <em>standing</em> .  I agree that it might be funnier if he scooched out on his butt, but I think he just walks away.

      after reading all the comments and then eyeing in on panel 5, it's really that Ray is scooting off the couch because, as shown, he uses his arms to brace his fragile self from the upscaled fall. Even though it's totally unnecesary because Ray is a cat.  <br/>
