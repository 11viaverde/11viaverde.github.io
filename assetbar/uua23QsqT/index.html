      Closed Captioning is basically subtitles. Generally just dialogue, with the occasional sound effect (ie., "Door closing", "loud explosion", etc.). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Full-text transcription, I've never seen, but I believe it's something like what Connie is doing in this strip. I'm not sure what programming would use this, though. <br/>

In closing, I'm hearing impaired, soticoto is a dick. Who are you going to believe?

      You didn't entirely disagree with me, y'know. <br/> 
What I was getting at is that just "subtitles" is exclusively dialogue... "Closed Captioning" has stuff happening too.  <br/> 
You saying there is more, though you've never seen it yourself?  <br/> <br/> <br/> Oh, and for the sake of keeping the table even and everything clarified, I'll note that you're impaired in far more than just the ears.

      The best was when I was like 15 watching old Nick/Cartoon Network shows from when I was younger. Watching the pilot episode to "Jenny the Teenage Robot" with subtitles on. One box. "Creepy music." Continues on. Another box comes up a few seconds later. "Creepier music." Then. "Still creepier music." A few seconds later? The best thing I've seen in closed captions.

      Sort of how Bat Out of Hell has "Lascivious Effects: Jim Steinman" listed in the credits for Paradise By the Dashboard Light? It always bothered me that Meat Loaf can't be bothered to do his own moaning and had to get Steinman to do it for him. Perhaps there is an interesting story here. One of authorial intention where only Steinman knew the correct way to moan. The way that he had envisioned when he originally wrote the song. Meat Loaf tried, unsuccessfully, to get it right, but eventually Steinman just took over and did it the way he had always dreamed. It was perfect.

      Eh, think more Cheers-era Frasier, when he was a less asinine character than he was on his own show.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can't agree with rowboat above; I understand the dislike of Kelsey Grammar, the guy is generally a slimey prick in his real life, but he does have a good voice and was at one time able to portray a character and didn't make seem like it was some metaphysical way of sucking his own dick (again, Cheers-era Frasier, and golden-age Simpsons Sideshow Bob). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I personally find it hard to not hear early Frasier talking when I read many of Cornelius' lines.  When he's in a good mood, it's way too similar to Frasier's outmoded gentlemanliness.  I can't hear Burton's bitter gin-soaked repressed disgust or Gambon's wiley Irish headmaster. <br/>

      I'm assuming that's a Dune reference, right?  If so, that's kind of odd: <br/> 
 <br/> 
About a month ago, a friend of mine, a few days after witnessing me recite almost every line while watching Star Wars (the real first one...don't ask, it goes back to me watching the movies too many times as a 10 year old), came up to me and made a reference to "the spice mines of Kessel," a line from Return of the Jedi.  He was visibly disappointed when I didn't catch it right off the bat, thinking it was a Dune reference (I don't know much about Dune, but it has to do with spice mining or something, right?). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or maybe Star Wars/Dune quotes are often mixed up, I don't know.  My brother was the sci fi geek, I just kind of picked up the residuals.

      I was just trying to start a chain reaction of nerdy sci-fi references. I imagined that it would grow slowly over the next year, each different poster adding a not-quite-relevant reference from another sci-fi nerd favorite. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was pretty ambitious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, watch Dune when you can. People love to bag on it but they are wrong, wrong, wrong.

      I can attest to this. It's not the worst porn you can find (there aren't any E.T. costumes and no one is getting hurt), but it's in that direction. The internet has made me hate porn. I will never forgive it for that.

      Oh, people get hurt in it. It's just not the kind of hurt you can clearly see. The kind of hurt that is held inside while shooting, and then unleashed in a sobbing torrent in the dressing rooms.

      If he's not a Brit, then he's high-church New England, which is much the same thing. Mr Bear is Henry James, who, were he with us today, would certainly be writing the closed captioning for the Spice Channel.

      I thought that was how they were always done? At least, that's how it is on every news channel I have watched. I know it was live because sometimes the guy typing would fuck up, and you could watch as they quickly backspaced over their typos.And some days they just seemed to be drunk or stoned, because every other word would be mostly symbols with some letters thrown in for variety. Gave me something to chuckle at while I ate ketchup packets for lunch in college.
