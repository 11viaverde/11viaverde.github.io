I thought it would be pretty bad to see two weeks of this, so it is good that it seems like it is skipping ahead in time.  However, now that I see it, I am not so sure that I don't want two weeks of this.

      Yeah, a lot of stuff can safely be glazed over, but every now and then it's nice to get a triple shot of something random. Then again, I wanted to see Vlad's 17 frames of "You talkink to me?", so maybe my opinion's in the minority.

      Asherdan made a point on another achewood messageboard (Touamb) that he was personally going to try and "make onstad hate assetbar"... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Him marking good messages as spam is just another part of his little plan. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I say mark Asherdan's messages as spam, because that's exactly what they are. He's over there laughing at all the lames he's accumulating (on purpose)

      I think now that the alt-text is clearly visible to all, people don't realize there was a time that it wasn't, and thus equate the alt-text posts with those posts that juts repeat a line from the strip. This is what I think. I think this.

      Ray saying "receptacle" makes me think his brain may somehow heal up stronger from all this, possibly in such a way that he will be able to accurately use words in conversation he does not in fact understand, like that kid in Rookie Of The Year but with words like "resplendent" instead of baseballs.

      I asked this to Chris once, He said the claws were necessary to show it was a cat's paw. I interpreted that as meaning that the claws come out when they exert a little pressure to hold onto something. (Not really applicable in this case, where the dice lie on the palm, but oh well.)

      Unfortunately, if there's one thing I've learned from this whole Assetbar thing, it's that people can read Achewood and nevertheless be complete dicks. <br/>

I'd like to see the whole chubby/lame system go away, I think.

      I do not mind Assetbar at all, and the chubby/lame system would be fine if Achewood readers would stop being so harsh, but they don't, so maybe, if you could only give chubbies and report spam, that would be better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, there was a post back up near the beginning that got 4 lames, and all it said was "Why is Ray wearing a turtleneck?" WHY WOULD YOU TRY TO DELETE THAT. If you want to be able to read even half of the comments on this board, you have to set your lame filter high, cause as it is,  <em>most</em>  comments get at least 3 lames. Of course, I'm sure this will get lamed and go down in a blaze of irony, but I, despite the fact that I'm at least 5 years younger than almost everyone on this forum, am mature enough to have some internet dignity. <br/>

      I was mighty tempted to lame this big block of text here, but then I read it instead and I guess you get a chubby. Little known fact: "Lame" is french for "edge" or "blade", so perhaps some readers think they are saying certain comments are "cutting edge stuff" when they mark it so.  <br/>

Consider yourself defeated, neonfreon. And I don't see what you have against the assetbar system, the only thing wrong with it if people like you who lame everything and make it impossible to see legitimate comments.

      Ha, ha - that's a very cute idea.  If you do this with a really kitty they get so furious in the cutest way!   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I actually really like the ones way back when the cats were a little more cat-like.  I really liked the weirdness of that.  The strip is still great, but great in a different way.

      In the face of the baseless and wanton use of the lame and the spam in this thread, one might want to hold back from giving a well-deserved lame for fear that it will be seen as just another out-of-line, unwarranted, drive-by laming.  However, rad-chillies definitely earned a lame here, if not a spam, from all people of good conscience.  S/he says s/he supports Onstad, while tearing him down personally and artistically.  Onstad posted three blogs today.  We get this stuff for free.  At least be polite to working artists, if you're not going to support them.

      well i feel dumb replying to this so late (i just discovered the 'inbox') but you guys totally misunderstood my comment.  I 'teared him down personally and artistically'? That's ridiculous.  i didn't say 'maybe he got high' in an insulting way, I guess it was more of a lame joke.  I guess you cannot mention the fact that a strip hasn't been posted without getting accused of hating on Onstad.  I genuinely thought that maybe he had written himself into a hole because I had no idea where he was going to go with it.  Sorry, I wish people could hear the tone of my voice when I say stuff online, maybe that would make things more clear...

      This strip totally reminds me of how I was before I was more honest about myself.  I was totally the kind of retard that thought publically liking peaches would let people know I was gay.  Or, like saying outloud that I knew what fois gras was.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also Ray's swollen muzzle is very cute. <br/>

Also, what is up with that medalion?  Do you think it's a religious icon?  If so Chris gets an extra gold star for "retard=religious zelot" commentary.   <br/>

2D6... What is it used for? <br/> 
Let us see now... <br/> 
 <br/> 
~ A Level 12 Monk's Unarmed damage. <br/> 
~ An unmodified Greatsword's (or Huge Longsword's) base Damage. <br/> 
~ Base damage done by the spell Flaming Sphere. <br/> 
~ Base damage dealt by passing through a Wall of Fire spell. <br/> 
~ Damage taken for falling 20 feet onto a hard surface. <br/> 
~ Damage per round for exposure to magma. <br/> 
~ Extra damage bonus of a Bane weapon against the relevant creature type, or of an alignment weapon against an opposite alignment target. <br/> 
~ Monopoly. <br/> <br/> <br/> Anything else? <br/> 
I'm not very good at thinking of non-D&D-related uses for 2D6. <br/> <br/> <br/>

      "Simple" Ray is adorable. And I always thought that peaches were a kind of "sexy" fruit. They are the only fruits that are both fuzzy  <em>and</em>  have a buttcrack.

      Getting very upset about nonsense, blood coming from places it should not come from. It seems that getting hit by a baseball for Ray is a lot like having a period for a woman.
