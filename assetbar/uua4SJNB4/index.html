      Todd's always got those really short lines that seem like they're indicating a constant trembling. It sort of has the effect of making him seem dirty, like he's emanating particles of grime from his body at all times.

      he's a squirrel. squirrels are sketchy, dodgey creatures. you ever watch one runnin' around? they all go this way, then that way. like physical stuttering. todd T squirrel just got a stutter like any other squirrel... and that's before accounting his narcotics and alcohol intake.

      Once I chased this squirrel and it ran partway up a tree trunk, then strafed around it. I ran around the tree to try and get at it, and rather than running  <em>up</em>  the tree it just continued to strafe  <em>around</em>  it in circles... and reversed direction when I tried chasing it the other way. <br/>

      I used to chase squirrels around the yard all the time. Then a few times it happened that I could have actually caught one (or at least touched/grabbed it momentarily) and I realized "what the hell was I planning to do with these squirrels once I caught them?"

      When I was nine years old we had to do outdoor fitness testing twice a year for gym class. I was running the 50-yard dash when a squirrel panicked and crossed my path at the exact wrong time. I had no time to react and ended up punting that squirrel at least 50 yards. It was not wearing a helmet.
