      Not brie in general. Just Ray's gooey variety and the way he's proddin' it. But really, though, everytime I sit on a crowded bench or have a blood test or use a flame thrower or eat lasagna or drive to work or call my mother I think of this scene. So it really doesn't mean much.

      frying brie would be considered extremely crass to a guy like ray, who will ditch a party if he sees someone holding their wine glass wrong.  brie is soft, but not that soft, so I think only heating explains why ray appears to be dipping into it like salsa con queso.

      I tried to stay out of it cause i think le chien kinda has a point, but now he's crossed a line I can't ignore.  My third grade math teacher spent most of the 1993-1994 academic year trying to drill into my thick skull that the alligator eats the larger amount of food.  His mouth is facing toward '25' instead of 'the group' so that means we're all less than 25 years old.

      I rather think he was a cult hero even when he was being reported for spam. His schtick grew out of the heady days of alt-text posting. Marking his slash posts as spam was as much a part of the game as chubbying first posts and laming repeats.  <br/> 
Also, if a situation changes, why should not our response change as well?

      the days when we posted alt texts are already "heady"?? wasn't that just like a month ago? it didn't seem very heady to me. it was headier when EVERYONE could mark stuff as spam, like what you see when you look at the comments for  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145551/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=10062005">this strip</a> , which i still think is the strip with the best comments ever, because of socks. that was kind of heady, i guess? maybe not. it is hard for things on a computer screen to be heady. <br/> 
 <br/> 
in any case, despite having more total chubbies than lames at this point, my account is still marked so that i can only post once every 24 hours. i don't know if this is because i have some 400 lames or because i have 7 posts marked as spam or because the powers that be know that otherwise i would pick a day to write the words "ENCROACH UPON MINE MUPPETLIKE TURD," and then click Post several thousand times, in the comments for a new strip (anybody else: please feel free to do this in my stead). <br/> 
 <br/> 
also, dear killerlimpet: if you are going to refer to my posts as "his schtick" then you can just crawl back into the VUX intruder you came from, dude

      "if you are going to refer to my posts as "his schtick" then you can just crawl back into the VUX intruder you came from, dude " <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was referring specifically to the series of posts containing slash fanfiction labeled as alt text (ie, 12 July 2007). This subset can be accurately described as a schtick; your posts in general can not.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also just enjoy describing things as "heady," it's an adjective that doesn't get used enough.  <br/> 
 <br/>

Why is it that a person can post the most pointless and inane comments on here as long as they're gushing in approval, but if a person wants to post a simple statement of dislike you have to elucidate and footnote?   <br/>

You know what? If people can just post quoted lines from the day's strip with no reason of explanation as to why they like it and get chubbied out the asshole, then chien can post a summary dismissal of a strip in the same manner and not be expected to "explain himself."

      Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly certain that we're here to discuss and celebrate the finer bits of this cartoon strip. Sure, people quote it wantonly, but we dig this comic.  It is natural.  Discuss can certainly mean critique and debate over artistic value, but you can't step into a room of fans with a turd in a basket and expect to be lauded.  Pissing on someone's parade is lame, no matter which way you serve it up.  And to me, it seems like this guy's job to do just that.

      True, but it's no less natural to make a bit of a smart ass quip when you don't like something, as well.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sure, this is a fan board, but please tell me that you don't all think that every comic is beyond criticism.  I think chien's comment is pretty accurate in general, and this is coming from some one who gives out 5's way too fucking much (look at my public view, even I'm embarrased).  Everybody knows now that, most of the time you post something negative, you're going to get lamed/burned/etc., but too often it seems way too vehement, fan-boyish.  Everybody who signs up to this thing probably likes the strip as a whole, so if someone makes a negative comment now and again, don't act like he's the damned devil for doing so.

      Man, I gave this strip a 2.  But summarily dismissing the entire board for their opinion is just being a dick.  That was a condescending comment, and it deserved to be lamed.  I agree that saying why you don't like a strip gets the communal axe far too often , but being a furious cock about it doesn't help the matter. <br/>

Good to see someone reasonable on the board, either way though.  Chubby for that.

      Well, my point was more that he had a pretty big statement and he didn't back it up at all.  That's fine, I had no bones with that, but I came in after he and Blastridus got into name-calling (I also found Blastridus' comment lame).  It was the "fuck off, you utter dick," which attitude I feel is getting a little too common, and I said so, as I've said here before.  In large I agree with both you and hellofyellin.

I've been a jackass. I'm really sorry.  I actually agree with your first post.  Onstad could do about anything on here and get some solid feedback just because he's Onstad, but that's because he built up a solid repertoire, you know? <br/>

Your second post was kind of rude, even if the guy before was wrong or being stupid. Hell, he probably just wanted to quote the strip as a comeback. I only got into it because your posts were...well, you know. <br/>

 <em>HOWEVER</em> , that doesn't give me the excuse to go off on you and fire up an argument. Over a god-damn  <em>comic</em>  strip.  <br/>

      It seems emmentalary now you mention it.  In fact, isn't there a whole cottage industry devoted to this?  Probably the same people who filmed a guy giving sherry to a goat, and a bishop breaking wind?  The whey I heard is they have arty directors such as Wes Anderson ( <em>Bottle Rocquefort</em> ) film them.

      I've seen  <em>Hotel Chevre</em> , and the tagline is actually in French, and translates to " <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145551/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uuactzlF0">Poached He Goat</a> " It's just a thin slice of life wedge precedes  <em>The Darjeeling Mimolette</em> .  It isn't that great, and it won't be shown with the film in theaters, so you might have to wait tilsit comes around on DVD and rennet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The best part is Natalie Portman with her  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145551/https://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/encyclopaedia!openframeset&amp;frame=Right&amp;Src=/edible.nsf/pages/pantysgawncheese!opendocument">panties gone</a> .

      More accurately, right click somewhere on the background of the webpage (not the image itself), and select "View Source", which brings up the html behind the page. Then type Ctrl F, to do a word search, and you can either search for words in the ALT text itself, or just search for "img title", which is where it will be located.

      Is it just me, or are there a lot of people here looking for a punchline in every strip?  That is very un-Achewood.  Its roots grow in anti-punchline soil.  The story arcs involve exposition, build-up, character development, etc., and may not include any punchlines.  See the "Beef Proposes to Molly" arc for a prime example.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again, I remember there were some who complained about that arc being too saccharine.  Whatever.  Onstad should ignore the polls, is all I'd say.

      Seriously. With greater Achewood exposure comes greater trending toward every strip getting a perfectly average vote, it seems. Is it mathematically inevitable that soon every strip will rate a 2.5/5?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I came for the absurdity, and stayed for the absurdity. The punchline strips are cool, but they're not the stock-in-trade of Achewood. People who vote otherwise aren't getting the scene yet.

      Indeed. Why, oh why did they not pick an anthem that has a tune that can be sung by human vocal cords? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, my nominee for Greatest National Anthem of All Time goes to  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145551/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Anthem_of_Russia">Russia</a> . After the USSR folded, they decided to use an instrumental with the depressingly generic title of " <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145551/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Patriotic_Song">Patriotic Song</a> " as an anthem, but then they decided hey, the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145551/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Mikhalkov">guy who wrote the lyrics to the Soviet anthem</a>  is still around, why not have him write new lyrics for Russia? And lo, it was done. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I agree with you about "America the Beautiful" and "O Canada." The phrase "the True North strong and free" is wonderfully evocative.

      She said in one of her blog posts that Beef said to her 'when you marry a guy, you marry his family' and she agreed.  She seems almost keen, certainly extremely steadfast, about having to deal with Showbiz.  Myself I think that's a bad attitude, but it seems Beef shares it too... although maybe Beef thinks paying off Showbiz's debt is one thing, but voluntarily inviting him to the wedding he'll only ruin is another. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I want to know is why is it when the 'biz is around Beef suddenly becomes uber-responsible?

      I'm guessing you have no siblings.  Their behavior might reflect on you because you were raised together, so their slightest misstep tends to shame you into overbearing responsibility.  Similarly with significant others, whom you have actively chosen to be with--their bad manners might be mistaken for the thing that attracted you.  Of course, yielding to the urge to correct is what reflects poorly on you in these situations, as it reveals a heart lacking in generosity toward a loved one. <br/>

      This is a comment.  I read it.  I read this comment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, the number of comments escalated, probably b/c of this: Assetbar started roughly in the spring of 2007, I think (I've been reading achewood for 4 or 5 years, but didn't join Assetbar right away).  In general, you'll probably notice more comments for any strips after that time, and the longer on it goes, and more people join, the more comments you'll see on the newer strips.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Add in the unfortunate fact that you rarely get a 5-strip-a-week effort from Onstad these days (in fact, it seems to average about 3 strips a week nowadays), and you wind up seeing conversations and comments piling up on a strip's 2nd day being featured as the newest one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, I'm not necessarily bitching about the less frequent new comics (that's purely based on my current perception; I haven't researched the archive or anything)
