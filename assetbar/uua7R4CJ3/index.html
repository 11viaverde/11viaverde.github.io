      The lead singer/guitarist guy is at Uni studying music and was attempting to put together a PHD on what the formula for the perfect pop song would be. I'm guessing he used Weezer as his experimentation (i.e. "Beverly Hills") <br/>

For the record, I think Pinkerton and the Blue Album are two of rock's seminal albums. I also think that their more recent stuff, save a few songs, is pretty much shit.

      Fuck Papa Roach. And all this Nu-metal bullshit. You can replace all of the lyrics with "broken home," "my daddy didn't love me," or (my personal favorite) "my girlfriend hates me because I'm a selfish asshole with a small ding-dong" and it totally works. I think that's the gist of what most of today's bands are saying anyway. Well, that's what I am hearing them say in my brain meats.

      I've been putting it off, because I know that they who hold the Keys to Achewood will sniff out my heresy, and hunt me for the disease that I am. But now I must make good my insane rantings! <br/> 
 <br/> 
What we have here in Achewood - and, by extension, in the rest of the world - is a question of Tribal Identity. We all belong to a tribe, or, at the very least aspire to. For Pat, people like Bono or Moby are tribal leaders, telling him (and other members of his tribe) the best way to do things. Some tribes, such as punk, don't really have firmly established leaders, but they do share enough of a common value-set that two tribe members could talk to each other and be fairly certain of getting along. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What we run into more and more, is that the prevailing tribes in the West, specifically America, are not about what you do, or what you believe, but about what you purchase. Nowhere is this more easily seen than the so-called "indie" tribe. They're readily identifiable by the clothes they wear, the music they listen to, even the coffee they drink. But scratch beyond the surface of this, and you'll find... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nothing. Nothing that's holding them together other than the granfaloon of being indie. They did not have to earn their identity, they did not have to strive for entrance to the tribe. They put it on as easily as their vintage shirts, and it leaves just as deep of an impact. It is a soft philosophy for a soft people, a tribe that requires little risks and gives little reward. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Compare this to the persecutions of the Jews, or early Christians. (I am forced to use religious "tribes" here - there are very few Western tribes nowadays, nowadays, outside of religion, that have the capability to temper a soul like good steel, save perhaps military tribes.) In both instances, it cost of identity with these tribes was murder...and people still gladly paid it. For them, the ultimate cost was more than balanced out by the prospect of ultimate payoff - But the stakes were high, and it took powerful refinement of the soul so that they could identify themselves with such a tribe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So what does this have to do with Achewood? Sadly, it shows the knuckleheads in a poor light. Each one of them has risked little, and gained little in return. Pat has taken up causes and wears the mantle of offenses that he never had to take the brunt of. Ray has never had to face hardship, and then had the good fortune (if you can call it that) to be able to throw cash at all his problems to make them go away. Cornelius has given up on his  virtuous aspirations as a herald of Truth, and has instead settled down to a steady stream of pap that nobody will miss. Lyle and Todd - you know they both checked out of the game, the moment it got a little too real. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Which leaves us with the two characters that stick out most in our minds - Beef and Phillipe. Phillipe (a character who is two young to have developed a tribe) we are drawn to, because we see several things. A constant and sure black-and-white approach to the world that all yearn for, but few find. An innocence that we all possessed before we were ever tried, tried to our very souls. And a sense of potential, of all the good that he could be, that comes off of him in palpable waves. But in the end, it's all just a cop-out anyway - Phillipe is five, and he will always remain five. Much like Tom Sawyer, he's idealized, and any fall from this pedestal would shatter his image in our minds. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then there is Roast Beef. He is from Circumstances. And Circumstances have become his tribe. It's a very lonely and selfish tribe, however. He doesn't seek help from his problems, not even when they get between him and Molly. He doesn't seek to change. He has bronzed his Circumstances, and wears them around his neck, proclaiming that Nobody can understand, Nobody can identify. Pride is not about having - it's about having more than everybody else. And Beef ego-boosts by having more problems than everybody else. Even when he's got depression. <br/> 
 <br/> 
How can this cast of soft, toothless boys go beyond what they are now? By removing Death as a motivator, the prime distilling quality of most non-religious lives is removed, and almost everybody becomes static characters, their only hopes reaching out for poor, fallible people to fulfill emotional needs that cannot be met that way. They must play out their dull, superficial lives, with no hope of reprieve. It makes me pity them, even as I laugh and commiserate.
