      That was possibly the most intricately crafted pun I have ever had the mis/fortune of laying my eyes open. At first I thought it was just a bit of a stretch, and that you were attempting to cash in on the whole pun business by making an unrelated pun - but, giving you the benefit of the doubt, I clicked upon the link. When I reached the part explaining that it meant bear, my mind was well and truly blown. I am in awe of your prowess. <br/>

What I mean to say is, have a chubby, good sir.

      <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Albrecht, who was not associated with any particular animal rights organization, later claimed that he was quoted out of context: According to Albrecht, he had filed suit against the head of the Leipzig Zoo in December 2006, for killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. The case was dismissed by the courts arguing that raising the animal by humans would have been inappropriate. Albrecht, who opposed that judgment, says he called for Knut's death not because he actually wanted to have the bear killed, but merely to call attention to the Leipzig decision, which would have granted the Berlin Zoo the right to kill the polar bear cub. Most international media, however, relied on Bild-Zeitung's version and reported Albrecht's request to have Knut killed out of context.</em></div>

The Kamchatka brown bear is one of the world's largest, with males growing to around three metres (10ft) and weighing up to 700kg (1,540lb). They can also reach speeds of up to 30mph (48km/h) despite their size. The peninsula, nine timezones east of Moscow and twice the size of Britain, is home to an estimated 16,000 bears  <br/>

      There was a russian man named Rudolph, a high ranking member of the KGB. One evening Rudolph and his wife, were walking along, and it began to snow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"My, my, look at the lovely snow," said his wife. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"No, that is not snow, that is rain!" replied Rudolph. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"No, no, no, this is snow," she said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Look, there is a palace guard, we will ask him." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rudolph went to the palace gaurd and said, "is it raining or snowing?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
The gaurd was no dummy, so he said "what do YOU think it is doing, rudolph?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rudolph replied, "raining." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The gaurd said "yes comrade, I was going to say raining, also!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
So Rudolph and his wife went walking off. The gaurd could just barely hear the KGB official say: "Rudolph, the Red, knows rain, dear." <br/>

      I always laugh when people laud Dickens and Shakespeare for their writing ability. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean their writing was written for the lowest common denominator in order to create the greatest amount of profit  <em>they weren't even trying to be famous in the future.</em> <br/>

      I'm just saying that they intentionally dumbed down their work in order to play to the most people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dickens was especially guilty of this. The Pickwick Papers was basically focus group tester in order to get the most amount of people to spend the most amount of money. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's just ironic that modern literary critics laud what in effect was the 18th century equivalent of three camera sitcoms.

      I put the phrase in quotation marks, which yielded one page of results. I noticed someone mentioning it was a Mr. Show quote, then re-Googled it in conjunction with Mr. Show to confirm it. The entire process took all of about forty-five seconds. I figured that since it was that easy, I would encourage you to try a little harder, and then a level-six shitstorm hit town, washing away several key senses of humor in the process.

      I googled the phrase and scanned through several pages of results, noticing that nothing referenced a TV show or movie, figured that maybe this was a modified reference (it seemed familiar, but maybe "Hawaii" wasn't in the original quote?), and, unthinkably, decided to ask what it might be from.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
You, of course, have much superior googlin' skills than I do, and found it.  You could've just given me the answer, but no, you had to be smarmy, indirect and patronizing.  So I give you a little shit back, don't go acting like you didn't ask for it.  If you didn't want a "shitstorm," try not being a prick and just answer somebody's simple question (I mean, shit, you didn't even say "google it," you actually put the link for shutupandgoogleit.com). <br/>

There's something very strange about that. I guess I don't really know any 19-year-olds anymore, so I shouldn't have any specific reason to be shocked that someone of that age could be familiar with Brad Neely without knowing Danny Elfman. Still, 19 or not, that's fucked up, and I say that as a great fan of both of them.

      well, all of my friends at the very least know who Danny Elfman is thanks to my frequent obsessive ravings, but other than a few of them downloading 'Little Girls' after I played it at a party none of them care nearly as much as they should. Mr. Neely's work is a completely different story, two of my friends and I discovered it separately but at about the same time. Now thanks to us WPDR is slowly but surely replacing the news of Nina's herpes as the quickest thing to spread through our community's youth.

      I hate that everyone associates The Nightmare Before Christmas with hot topic. It's like any time merchandise for anything gets sold there, it's instantly stupid and only for emo/scene kids.  <br/> 
TNBC is my all-time favorite movie, I've seen it hundreds of times and I'm definitely not one of the lame hot topic kids.

      As far as I know he is extremely popular, even if a lot of people don't know it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Wait....I guess that doesn't make any damn sense. I guess what I mean is that he's extremely rich and people the world over have an intimate knowledge of his work (by which I refer to his excellent, excellent film and television scores) even if they may not know his name or history. I mean, as popular as Tim Burton is, Danny Elfman is as well, just in a different way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Incidentally, his score for  <em>Edward Scissorhands</em>  may be my favorite from any movie, ever.

      Yeah, if you like I could give you 10,000 words on why it it  <em>not</em>  the case, and why our collective decision to continue teaching it that way is counterproductive to the full emancipation of the majority gender, and I really don't reckon that sociology is a dumb field of study it's just that our method of institutionalized learning has never been particularly good with that sort of work, but all of that can be found by other writers on the Internet and no one really wants it, not me you nor EatMoreKix, and I knew that last night but was drunk enough to figure everyone would just want a little snarky comment instead.

      I find your parallel between women and racial minorities... vaguely insensitive. The reason the shirt (even in such poor taste) works with women but not racial minorities is because women really aren't that bad off, considering. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Somehow, I think groups that have been enslaved as recently as 150 years ago - in this country no less - and could be beaten or killed publicly 35 years ago (and arguably still today) have it a bit rougher than women, whose biggest complaint today are that they make slightly less money in the workplace than men and have jokes made about them... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not a misogynist, I just think there's a perspective to these things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Also, "minority" is a lame phrase for what you mean. For instance, if the shirt had been about say, Italians - who are a minority, people would have been more confused than offended.)

      "Minority" is a lame word for a number of reasons, especially when applied to Asian women. But your statement that womens' "biggest complaint today are that they make slightly less money in the workplace than men and have jokes made about them" is a bit factually inaccurate. A tad. I think you'd find a deeper look into the crime statistics over the past 35 years educational.

      I'm not sure if you're talking about rape - but I was contemplating that after my post... I'm not really sure where I stand on it. Probably somewhere between "that's like saying 7-11 workers are discriminated against because they're victims of a certain type of crime as well" and "yeah, you have a completely valid point." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Regardless, I'm willing to bet (or I've been misled into thinking) that the correlations between your skin color and crime are stronger than the ones between your gender and crime. But of course, I'm no criminologist.

      God fucking damn it, I leave for one month and some syncopation jackass starts in with the Oppression Olympics. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Syncopation, dear, if you think women are not subject to violence because of their gender, please fire up the Googler and look up domestic violence, rape, and sex trafficking. Also, please consider women's gross underrepresentation in government and the millions of double standards we have to live up to that men don't before you tell me that we have nothing to complain about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then please expand your definition of "woman" to include non-white, non-American women, especially if you're going to be preaching to us all about racial oppression. Have you looked at what Latina women earn in comparison to white men? The difference is a bit bigger than "slightly less." Have you looked at the rights Saudi Arabian women have? Hint: those rights don't include voting or driving, rights which I think racial minorities have in this country (in fact, black men could vote before white women). <br/> 
 <br/> 
The truth is that the causes and effects of prejudice and oppression are complex and interlocking. To try and compare them is an exercise in futility and stupidity.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And are you a white dude sitting on the Internet telling us all how it is to be a woman and/or a racial minority? Because I think you may have just proved your own privileged, entitled ignorance.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Has this kind of shit just been breeding and swarming since I skipped town? Maybe it would be better for my health if I did not check back on Assetbar, even once a goddamn month.

(I know this was probably not the intended response but still. Thank you for being a good person on assetbar. Posts like these make me in small increments feel like I don't want to not wake up next time I go to sleep. The further this goes the more depressing it gets. Blargh.)

      I'm not going to respond to a lot of your more incendiary claims - people can sort out those things for themselves and I have a feeling I'm not going to convince you anything - but I do get the feeling you missed a large portion of my point. What I was trying to say was that being a party of a racial minority significantly raises your chances to have a lower quality of life. Gender just doesn't affect the numbers the way race does. Yes, it does impact certain aspects, such as victimhood of gender-based crimes, but it's just simply not an impact on the scale of race. As for being both, the problems are just compounded... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize you're sort of loved around here and that I'm probably signing my own internet death warrant by responding, but I want to make things clear. I'm not a racist or a misogynist, I just want to put things in perspective. I don't know how many people know about the Tulsa race riot (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_Race_Riots) outside of my state, but it is arguably the single most disgusting act of ignorance in the United States of the 20th century... and it's ridiculous to claim that something of that magnitude could have targeted women.

      Fuck that, don't apologize. Your post was quite reasonable and well-argued, and avoided lame cliched talking points like "privileged ignorance". Apparently if you are a white dude, you have no right to have an opinion on oppression. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Loneal actually made a couple of good points that I think were somewhat in agreement with what you were trying to say (which she was too busy being outraged to notice). Because I think what you meant is that gender  <em>on its own</em>  does not adequately explain oppression. And you know what, just to stir the pot a bit, neither does race. It is ridiculous to automatically put a female CEO whose six-figure salary is  <em>only</em>  75% of that of her male counterparts or a middle-class black guy who can attend Harvard and be elected president into the category of "oppressed minority" when there are people of all colors and genders who are living in poverty or dying of starvation.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
IMO, the fundamental source of oppression is class, both on a national and global scale. You can say that race and gender are exacerbating factors that become more and more prominent among the oppressed classes, as we see with the status of women in third-world countries, or the racism that abounds in poor rural areas. But those things are part of the superstructure, not the base. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This kind of bullshit is exactly what destroyed the Left in the 60's - forgetting the primacy of class and devolving into arguments over who gets "biggest victim" status. It is a selfish bourgeois attitude that demands recognition as a 'special' group instead of working to address the root causes of oppression for everyone.

Kidding. Anyway, I wasn't apologizing, just trying to duck out of a ridiculous argument. I THOUGHT loneal and I agreed on at least something, but, "I understood your point exactly. Your point is wrong." isn't exactly encouraging. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll say it very clearly here: I think both racial minorities and women have had  <em>extreme</em>  injustices done to them in the past - and continue to. It's just that one is worse than the other. One million is a very large number. It's just that one-million-and-one is still larger. You don't go to war against the other gender - that's guaranteed destruction of your tribe in a generation. But going to war against another color person? Much easier to justify. See where I'm coming from? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, the both gender and race are too entangled with class, wealth and power to be distinguished adequately for this little thought experiment - and probably irrelevant to those disparities which may be the real problem. So eh, whatcha gonna do?

      It seems to me you're speaking mainly of the US in discerning the differences between gender and race as they pertain to discrimination.   Bear in mind that A) independent analyses showed that during the run-off between Hillary and Barack, it was shown that the gender issue was MORE divisive than the race issue, and B) that in much of the developing world, women are very much worse off than men and subject to sex-based discrimination, repressions and violence.

      I believe that the gender issue is more divisive than the race issue during the primary season.  A lot of people--including my sister--think that women are plain catty and will be way too emotional.  And while it is true that men and women's minds are biologically different--true due to a priori stuff, and not just conditioning--they are only different due to a few things including sex drive and emotional intelligence.  Besides societal conditioning, I don't see why a woman would be less rational or capable of leading a country.  If women  <em>are</em>  less capable of leadership, it must be because it is not really much of an interest to a lot of women, and is perceived more as a male job.  Because women should cook and clean and make pretty things.

      "What I was trying to say was that being a party of a racial minority significantly raises your chances to have a lower quality of life. Gender just doesn't affect the numbers the way race does." I understood your point exactly. Your point is wrong. You honestly think being a woman doesn't affect quality of life? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Okay. Do you carry mace in your purse so you can fend off attackers? How many times have you been groped by a stranger (my count is 3 or 4, which is much lower than most women's)? Do you feel ashamed of your body because you've been told since you were young that vaginas are creepy and the hair you grow under your arms is disgusting (though the exact same hair is of course perfectly fine for men to have)? Have you been told you're "smart for a girl" or "I could have done better if I'd tried harder" for your academic achievements? Would anyone ever say you were at fault for your own rape? Do you have to  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100204022724/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubhOxoU7I9M">watch</a>   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100204022724/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSERFJ24nmk">commercials</a>  in which the punchline is that no one would ever want to be of your gender? Do you not get hired because it is assumed you will have children? If you do have children with a partner, are you the one who gives up the career? Are you called a slut if you have sex, but a prude if you don't? <br/> 
 <br/> 
And yeah, man, nothing bad has ever happened to women on a large scale. Except, I don't know, the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100204022724/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_homicides_in_Ciudad_Ju%C3%A1rez">Juarez Murders</a> ,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100204022724/https://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2006/03/30/unsolved_killings_terrorize_women_in_guatemala/">mass murders in Guatemala</a> , or various other large-scale killings that are happening today, not back in 1921. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, I'd be arguing the other side if someone was trying to say that women had it worse than racial minorities. Elbox, I can't believe you are accusing me of wanting "bigger victim" status, when the whole point of my post was to call that attitude out. Not to mention that you're arguing for "bigger victim" status based on class.

      Did he say being a woman "doesn't affect" quality of life, or merely that it affects it far less than other things do? Being called names and not being able to have as much sex as you want without universal approval does not compare to having your day-to-day survival threatened. And the examples of mass violence that you cited are all from third-world countries (which completely supports my earlier point), while the race riots happened right here in the first world. The point about class is that it's NOT a competition for victimhood precisely because class  <em>includes</em>  women and racial minorities based on the actual conditions of their lives rather than some imagined solidarity, and because the oppressed classes of the world are not a minority, but rather a huge majority. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm  not saying that we shouldn't pay attention to gender or race issues, but they should be kept in context and perspective because, just like you said, they are intertwined with everything else. Unfortunately people often make them the end-all-be-all of their political stance, like in the primaries, when people thought that either electing the first woman or the first black president was the most important thing in the world, even if both of them were nearly indistinguishable pro-corporate centrists and the white male Kucinich was a far more progressive candidate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I just thought your initial reaction and insults at syncopation were unwarranted. Unless someone actually means and says something to the effect of "women are inferior to men", how about we try holding off on calling them privileged ignorant misogynists for once?

      Unwarranted isn't the point; they were counterproductive. Presumably Loneal wants to persuade men to her viewpoint, unless she believes that the feminists will defeat the patriarchy with military force. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And, Loneal, you are not ignorant enough to pretend you think that "class" is separate from gender, nor are you unobservant enough to think that Achilles will fall for that. Trust me when I say this ain't flattery. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, Achilles, you know better than most that the First and Third Worlds can't be separated. As it happens --let me crane my neck-- ah, yes, there's the site of a Juarez femicide, he says from the comfort of his U.S. home.

      The way I see it, this is just me as a middle-class white woman talking--most all of the shit that is bad about being a woman, you can overcome.  Some if it, such as a propensity to be attacked or assaulted, that you can't do anything about, and it's incredibly unfortunate.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not ashamed of my body, though.  That's an individual thing--if a person is incapable of seeing past those caddish remarks and advertisements, then that is just the way it is.  If it wasn't advertisers telling them they aren't pretty enough, it would be advertisers telling them they aren't man enough.   I never bought into that line of thinking, and I really get a little insulted when it is suggested that women feel bad about themselves because of some men's remarks and Revlon ads.  Really?  Is that all it takes to get my little-lady mind all fucked up?  Of course not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rape, you're absolutely right on.  No one would contest that a man was "asking for it" if he was violently assaulted by another man.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
For what it's worth, I see a lot more commercials on television these days that revolve around a man being a slavering, oaffish manchild who needs to have his wife do everything for him.  Really though, as I said earlier, anyone who's entire perception of themselves is wrapped up in advertising doesn't really deserve to feel good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I agree that some systematic gender discrimination exists, but I don't think you can really DO anything about the rest.  Women will always be judged on their physicality, but that doesn't mean anything.  Whether a man wants to fuck me or not never sends my psyche into a whirl.  When I see beautiful women in magazines, I don't enter into some tailspin about how I'll never be pretty enough.  I'm insulted when it is suggested that I will, and I need to have certain things kept away from me, lest they destroy my ego.  Trust me, they won't.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I agree with you, mostly, and I think women do have it harder than men in general.  It is just that some of the particular feminist tropes seem patronizing.

      Man, I would love to do a lot of hugging on you Autre.  You've cleanly stated the opinions that my wife and I share about contemporary sexism in the country quite nicely.  It's far, far worse in other places of course, and was truly horrific in the states as recently as 50 years ago.  But now, a large part of the perceived sexism is in the eye of the beholder, and not being swayed by jackass opinions from others is not a sexism issue. <br/>

fuck off. it's not about insufficient standing. it's about some comments that were made which some people, myself included, found highly disagreeable. i didn't bother to respond because of how rudely i was smacked down. of course i know there are more women than men, for fuck's sake. and while it was perhaps legitimate for syncopation to take offense at what i said, his extreme underestimation of sexism was enough to make any self-respecting feminist bristle. i wasn't expecting loneal to swoop in and save the day, but i don't have the energy to argue shit like this, and i certainly couldn't do it as eloquently.

I don't like the stupid misogynist jokes, especially, and I don't think observing that women are not a numerical minority is especially insightful.  What I object to is the REPEATED drama and invective aimed at people who mean no particular offense and are just trying to have fun on a message board about a comic.

 <br/> 
Excerpt: "That women are so integrated on that most primal of levels probably explains why sexism is harder to see than other -isms which oppress people. If women are killed because of their sex it mostly doesn't happen in large public slaughterings but privately, one woman at a time, and in each case we wonder if the cause for the killing might not have been something personal, something unrelated to the gender of the victim. And note that while most racists don't have parents of the race they now hate, all misogynists do. -- It's all too close, too intimate, too hard to see because we lack the necessary distance, the necessary ability to see the possibly oppressed as a separate group." <br/> 
 <br/> 
And with that, I'm out. I'm going to go walk around alone at night since I don't have to fear any violence anymore, and then I'll probably go drop by the women's shelters to tell them their services are no longer needed. Oh, and then I'm going to plot against Oklahoma, which I apparently hate a lot?

      I can't believe you don't see the irony in posting what you just did in the context of this argument. That women are "integrated on the most primal levels" is not simply a veil that prevents us from seeing sexism, it's a very real fact of life that explains why sexism cannot be compared to other "isms". Being "integrated" is a privilege that far from everybody enjoys. If we lack the distance to see women as a separate group it is precisely because they are not a separate group. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"...we wonder if the cause for the killing might not have been something personal, something unrelated to the gender of the victim." - Do you think this is not the case most of the time? The two are not mutually exclusive - someone's gender determines the sort of personal relation that one has to them. Or do you actually believe that there are tons of men walking around (besides a few Buffalo Bill types) who just hate women for no other reason than that they have vaginas?

      Your victims of violent crime statistics don't mean much because "woman" and "non-white" are not mutually exclusive categories. If they were split up into "white women," "women of color," and "men of color" they might mean a little more, but we wouldn't know whether the women of color were victims of violent crime because of their gender or their race (or both; racism and sexism are  <em>intersecting ideas</em> ). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even then, those numbers are probably still pretty useless given the extremely low percentage of women who report being raped. Depending on the way that data was gathered, the fact that conviction rates for rapes are absurdly low might also skew those numbers. And of course the reason report/conviction rates are low is because victims of rape, unlike victims of virtually any other crime, are consistently accused of lying and of contributing to their own assault. And that happens because people habitually minimize violence against women, as has been happening throughout this entire thread.

      The Department of Justice site I was using is rather user-unfriendly, so I couldn't find the exact demographics I'd like. They tended to boil it down into "important" facts, but I couldn't find any kind of raw data in a centralized location. What I'd like to find is a version of  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100204022724/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4d/Lifetime_prevalence_of_incarceration.png">this</a>  for victims. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I said I that the numbers were  <em>interesting</em> , nothing more. You're right however: there is an established lean in the statistics. However, the DoJ estimates that 41.4% of all rapes are reported to police (2006). Consider that simple assault is reported only at the rate of 44.3%, and that theft is reported  <em>31.7%</em>  of the time, and I think either you know something the Department of Justice doesn't or you've been mislead. Going by their numbers (and there is no way to know their accuracy without the victims coming forward), rape is not drastically unreported. Take that as you will. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I found  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100204022724/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/34/SAT_by_sex.png">this</a>  while scouring the 'net. Probably says more about the test than the test takers, however. Reminds me of the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100204022724/https://epaa.asu.edu/epaa/v3n2.html">oarsmen-regatta analogy</a>  that was ostensibly biased (intentional or not) against lower-class families, especially blacks. Whether it was because of an intersection of demographic set or any other number of reasons, who knows.

      I once created a Facebook group to the effect of "I like my women like I like my coffee: disgusting."   I think it combines my dislike of coffee, and acceptance thereof only on the condition that it contains unacceptable amounts of sugar, with the notion that I can "only" appreciate the off-putting media ideal of the female form.   I think. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think I like creating enigmatic Facebook groups.

The perfect coffee is like the perfect woman: an idealized mix of mass-produced flavors, presented on a TV commercial, never to be sampled in this life or the next.

      Man, if you think Vonnegut is rambling and incoherent, I think upon reading any of his books, you would just dig up William S. Burroughs and just kick him square in the temple.  Don't even get me started on what you'd do to Pierre Guyotat.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Terrible, awful things.  Things even he would've never thought of.  Oh, the things you'd do! <br/>

It is okay not to like Vonnegut, I'm just surprised because so far the Venn diagram of Achewood readers vs. Vonnegut enthusiasts has pretty much been a perfect circle.

      I personally approach his stuff as though it were a collection of short stories and anecdotes surrounding an event or theme. On the note of science fiction, there are definitely elements of it, using the bizarre to draw parallels to dissociation brought on by war, post-industrial culture, etc... i've seen the term "science fiction minus the science"

      Chubbied for the link. I'm keeping that page open in a background tab 24-7 so I can get to it whenever I need it. Which is often. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or, come to think of it, I could widgetize it and keep it on my desktop. Then, I'll find a way to integrate it into Twitter, and also turn it into a Firefox extension. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then, I'll get sued by  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100204022724/https://scottcarver.info/">Scott Carver</a> , who created instantrimshot.com. My applications will be removed from the Internet in wake of a cease and desist order. A landmark intellectual property battle will ensue which will decide once and for all whether a crude, stock-art button and an anonymous 4Kb clip of three drum hits can qualify as "intellectual property."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It will be determined that I infringed on Carver's copyright by using the name "Instant Rimshot," and I will ordered to pay an undisclosed sum (equal to an estimate of his lost AdWords income during the time my appliations were available) in damages.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
One week later, they will reappear, newly christened "Rimshot On Demand." No one will care. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or, I could create those little applications and donate them to Carver, and establish my rep as a creator of pointless little applications without rancor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Alternately, these applications may already exist, rendering all of this speculation an even more pathetic waste of keystrokes than it already is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In conclusion: I need a life. And some sleep. And therapy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thank you and good night.

      This comic has been up for less than a day and already people are frustrated at the comments. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not to be rude, but you aren't PAYING for the privilege to post comments. If you were I would understand stuff like pogo's angry rant yesterday or daidai's hatred of puns. But you aren't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not that I'm saying that that's what aperson is trying to get across, some type of deep seated hatred of everyone here, this is just something that ways heavily on my mind.

      Chill, brah. Somewhere on this page I said something along the same lines as you, though in a much more understated way. The "hooker with a heart of gold" is an archetype that goes back to the ancient courtesans and runs through Baudelaire, Dostoyevsky, etc., all the way up to Sin City. Entirely fictional at this point, true, but even more interesting for what it reveals - perhaps a desperate need to cloak our base desires in noble sentiments? So if you're a fairly educated dude sitting in a nudie bar and feeling kind of ashamed for being there, you can comfort yourself with the idea that one of these strippers is maybe a wonderful, free-spirited, but troubled girl who dropped out of art school and is sick of dealing with all the drunken louts that come in while she waits unrealistically for someone like you to come and talk to her about Proust and try to take her away from this place - an offer which she, having been hurt too many times before, will at first refuse but eventually give in to when she is overpowered by her strange attraction to you - so much stronger than she could have ever dreamed during all those wasted years and forgettable flings! - and the two of you will get a nice loft in Bushwick and live a happy life where you help each other fulfill your mutual dreams, you by convincing her to finish her art degree, she by finally giving you the inspiration and confidence you need to finish your dissertation... <br/> 
 <br/> 
But really, you just want to look at their tits.

      Strippers are very respectable people, and they only do what they do to make our days less terrible.  They only grind on your crotch because they like it and you like it, not to make their X's jealous.  Never that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They would never try to guilt you into staying in a relationship with you, even after they went on a rant about how they stalk their X to get child support.  Not even after she yelled at your for being "paranoid" about wearing a condom.  Not even after you caught her poking holes in your rubber. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They are just women, trying to pay for their son's next birthday coke.  Cake, sorry.  They don't do coke.

      We just broke up like, last week.  Of course by "we" I mean "I" and by "broke up" I mean "deleted my number out of her phone, made heavy sexist to our waitress throughout dinner, begged for anal, then got in my car and left." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm glad you enjoyed my above cynicism, you are beautiful.
