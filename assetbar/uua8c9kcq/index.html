      Ah, good old Frist Psot - I remember when he won the gold medal for Norway in the 100 Meter Yak Lift event at the 1928 Olympics.  It was a great day for Norwegians everywhere, and pretty darned exciting for those of us who had never seen the underside of a yak before.

Seriously though, I want to say something about the strip, but what's left to say?  It's pretty much classic Achewood, just a new chapter in their lives.

      I'm not sure this is a good idea. I mean most of  <em>any</em>  given thread is already a commentary on itself. So instead of posting that commentary in actual posts, you'd just be having it here. Also, it will get weird if people respond to this post and then you change it and no one can see what they're responding to. But maybe I'm wrong, we'll see. Just stuff to keep in mind.

      This is true but irrelevant. In the time it takes for the light of the clock displaying "12 am" to reach your eyes, not to mention the processing time in your brain, it is already after midnight. Therefore 12:00 AM is 100%, definitively, 12 midnight, and not 12 noon.

      According to  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304225839/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achewood">this</a> , the font is "Blue Highway". <br/> 
 <br/> 
edwell doesn't  <em>always</em>  get the font right, mind you. Compare  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304225839/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=03232007">this</a>  to  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304225839/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uuacfm0Fn#comment_45">this</a> , for instance. And while you're at it, give the latter a chubby, why don't you (if you haven't already). As of March 3 2009, it only has 44. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(In fairness, I don't know the font either. But the fact that edwell got it wrong is no excuse, I guess.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
(I'm not trying to sound like a  <em>prick</em>  about the font - I just had to somehow segue from fonts to that glorious laughy-laugh creation of his.)

      Instead of looking up "mittelschmerz" like a smart person I decided to use some language-fu to figure out what it meant.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Okay. I know schmerz means pain or sorrow. Like weltschmerz, that's world sorrow. So "mittel" ... sounds kind of like the word middle in the English language, and English and German are part of the same language family, so that's likely to be correct. Ergo ... middle sorrow? Hm. Yeah, okay. Molly's gonna hit her mother until she has a mid-life crisis." <br/>

      Man, I remember the speech I gave at my brother's wedding. I prepared as soon as they started getting serious. The wedding was really informal, he and a few hungover friends just dressed up and went to the courthouse, and they didn't even let me know they were going to get married until about an hour beforehand, they had just said I should keep that day clear "for a surprise." Being as I turned 21 in three days I thought they had bought me a keg, so I showed up in my drinkin' pants and my Guinness rugby shirt. Not exactly a tux, tailored or not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, we were all standing around drinking gas station champagne before going to the courthouse and my speech went thusly (It is important to note that his wife is Spanish, as in from Madrid, and she is named Alex):  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"You know, when you first run into a relationship that really defines what love is to you, you really remember that moment. I remember when my mom was on the phone with Andrew when he was at college and she turned to me and said, 'Andrew has met this wonderful person at college, named Alex!' <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I said, 'Oh, that's completely great!' Then I turned away, but then thought and said, 'A... Alex is a chick, right?' and she said, 'IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE ANDREW IS YOUR BROTHER AND HE IS MY SON AND WE LOVE HIM' and then she dropped the phone and started crying and she locked herself in the bathroom and wouldn't come out no matter HOW many times I said I wanted dinner. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, later we found out that Alex was indeed a chick, and she was also Spanish. That added a certain 'cultural barrier' to the whole occasion of meeting her. I remember when she came to America she was very impressed by all kinds of things, such as running water, and the postal system, and it took us the  <em>longest time</em>  to convince her that our television was not full of ghosts.  <em>(From this point on Alex was giving me the finger.)</em>  But we managed to explain everything through a series of colorful drawings, so we got all that sorted out.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, these two are getting hitched, and they seem to love the hell out of each other and that's pretty okay to me, and it's a nice day out and everything's nice and all horseshit aside I can't think of anything better. I guess I could dress it all up with fancy language, but it doesn't need it, really. It's beautiful just as it is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, chin chin." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then we went to the courthouse and the judge was really leery about Alex getting married because he thought she was Mexican and they were doing it for her green card, even though she was half-raised in LA, and then we went to the wedding reception which turned out to be at the Fox and Hound down the street. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They have two wedding photos I really remember: one is of Alex in this beautiful red dress with a veil, lining up a shot at a pool table with a cigarette danging from the corner of her mouth and a glint in her eye. And there's another of them stuffing two hot wings into each other's faces, and I'm in the background looking retarded. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And that's how a wedding should be done.

      Well, I knew about an hour ahead of time. My parents live in a different city and their intent in getting married spontaneously and with a bunch of close friends around was that it wouldn't screw one side of the family over. Spain would have to come to America or America to Spain. (I was SO FUCKING ROOTING for having it in Spain just so I could go on someone else's dime. I went later, anyways, though.) <br/>

As to why they didn't tell the folks, fuck, I dunno. Just sissies, I guess.

      My brother is getting married not too long from now, and every fiber of my being wishes to totally crib off your speech.

      The one thing I came to a conclusion about for the speech I gave for my younger brother when he got married is that 1) All jokes must be clean, and 2) You make fun of the bride at your own peril.  Putting everything else aside, it's  <em>her</em>  day.  Or at least, she's the one that will hold the grudge for all eternity, or until the divorce. So this was my opening paragraph, with names changed to protect the innocent: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Good evening.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have to admit, that when (he) and (she) tapped me to be the best man for today, I had a few problems coming up with what I considered to be an appropriate toast. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I first thought about talking about part of my early life with (him), but then I decided against it, mostly because the only story that immediately came to mind was one where (my older brother) and I would shove (him) into a sleeping bag and take turns dragging him up the stairs. Which isn't too appropriate, unless your theme is: "Love hurts."

      In this exciting, modern era, the average American stands in fear of many looming dangers: Islamic extremists desire nothing more than to wipe us from the face of the planet, largely due to our wanton love affair with pork and pork products; Al Gore and Maynard James Keenan conspire to sink California into the ocean by means of "global warming"; and, of course, the ever-present threat, persistently belabored by the media, of being smothered by the Michelin Man. Clear and critical analysis of the facts surrounding the Michelin Man, however, reveal that he is no threat at all, but rather represents the pinnacle of truth, justice, and the American Way. His white, rubbery exterior mirrors his firm but forgiving personality; his ready smile serves as a window to his inner warmth; and his demonstrated concern for Americans and their vehicles cannot be overlooked. Most obvious of these traits, however, is that which lies on the surface: his physical appearance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At first glance, the Michelin Man looks frightening, a twisted cousin of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man (1). This comparison undoubtably strikes terror into the hearts of many Americans, who live in a world where there are no Ghostbusters to turn the Statue of Liberty into a walking monolith of freedom and safety. Closer investigation, however, reveals that the Michelin Man has no relation to the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man at all - most notably, he lacks Stay-Puft's trademark hat and scarf. In fact, in depth analysis reveals that M.M.'s closest relative is, in fact, Strong Sad, the least threatening creature to ever walk on soolnds (2). Clearly, Mr. Michelin is only distantly related to the Strong Sad, perhaps several generations back in their evolutionary tree, as Michelin has clearly evolved the ability to smile, as he so often demonstrates. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Michelin Man's bright, comforting smile acts as a window to his soul, revealing that he could not, in any way, be responsible for the depraved crushings so often attributed to him. It is a proven, scientific fact that people responsible for such horrific acts (e.g. Charles Manson, Ted Kazynski, the aforementioned Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man) are incapable of smiling, as their hearts are so twisted and black that a toothy grin is their anathema. More importantly, the Michelin Man's obvious love and concern for the American motorist is proof positive that he is not the crazed, craven compactor the biased media makes him out to be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Michelin Man, first and foremost, stands for the ability to transfer power from an internal combustion engine to the ground causing locomotion, through his greatest personal passion: the Tire/Tyre. In weather fair or foul, the Michelin Man stands ready, enfolding Americans in his protective wing and keeping them driving through all weather, fair or foul. Indeed, given that he is himself made of tires, the Michelin Man is a fantastic example of self-sacrifice in the name of the greater good. Far from being a maniacal masher, the Michelin Man is concerned with no less than the absolute safety and sure-traction of the American public. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To conclude, it is obvious that the Michelin Man is nothing more than the target of a smear campaign, a blatant attempt to impugn his character in order to keep him out of office. His pleasant, round physique, his friendly, beaming smile, and his clear desire to keep American streets safe are all obvious proof that he could not possibly be responsible for these serial stompings spread throughout our culture. <br/>

Dear M. snidedk, D.S., <br/> 
 <br/> 
The best you can do is an F, I hope that's okay. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The word count is not some frilly guideline it is the only count that matters.  The way I see it it is like the brown M&Ms.  You see, the contract between the professor and student is best served following the rubric to a T and the ability to find little details to make people think that you care about their needs is far more important than some paper about "getting cruised" by the "Michelin Man".  I hope you learn next time.  BTW, there will be no next time.

      Really? I'd invite it into my house, chat it up with some wine, and ask it questions about its life. I'd be sincere, but not overly interested, as I wouldn't want to scare it. I'd offer it a few cigarettes, a few more glasses of wine, and wait. It wouldn't be long until the Michelin Man would get too tired -- or too drunk -- to stay. I'd show him the door. He would walk towards it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would wrap the piano cord around its neck and drag him backwards (keeping my distance from the lashing rubbery elbows) towards his new home. Eventually, his air supply would dwindle, exhausting my new pal.  at this point I could tie his weakened limbs together with the ropes and toss him into the garage apartment. I lock him into the barren bedroom, and block the door. I would then go to sleep. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Te next morning, I would peep through the keyhole to ensure his continued slumber. Upon confirmation, I would open the door and place the heaters inside. The pre-prepared aluminum casings in the walls ensure that no heat escapes. Hours will pass as my Michelin Pal bakes. He will scream, but I will play loud music. It will be afternoon by the time he begins to melt, so my music will not disturb my neighbors.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once I had my puddle of animated rubber, I would create my masterpiece. Days and weeks may pass as I deftly remelt and carve my opus. It would be painstaking, and the screaming would become bothersome, but sacrifices must be made. Within a month I should be halfway done.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another month, and I begin the brainwashing. Ludovico's technique, but looping. I cannot afford to pin the eyes, my masterpiece shall be fragile. After five or six runthroughs of my films, I will have my precious army. My one-foot tall living recreations of the cereal mascots will be complete.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
At last, I will have my supper with Tony, Sam, Booberry, Captain Crunch, the fitness lady on the Special K boxes, the Trix Rabbit, Snap, and Pop.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Crackle will not be invited. He will remain in his room.

      That exchange by those two avatars makes me feel like I have stumbled into some Steampunk fiction. Perhaps Sir Frederick and his team of misfit Jesuits and telekinetic Pre-Raphaelite painters could battle against a semi mechanical Spring Heeled Jack who was driven to evil by a campaign of heartless laming conducted by persons unknown (Jack the Ripper? Oscar Wilde?)

      I've come up with an awesome new way to give Chris Onstad money. You ever see that movie  <em>Office Space</em>  where the dudes are not satisfied with their place of employment so they decide to steal from them using cyberpunk computer skills and interest rate-magic?  Well this is kind of like that except what you do is you go to California and have a conversation with a plastic surgeon about having a third liver placed inside of you that creates gold coins like from Mario Bros. You then rent a helicopter not unlike Airwolf and have a friend pilot it while you hang from underneath, fastened to it by duct tape, except you have one arm free so that when you fly over Onstad's house you can cut your belly open and the money will come down like rain of golden blood and all the good children will look up and see and shout towards the sky for the Dying Kidney Angel Man, all runnin around, jumpin up and down backpacks agape with wanting and mouths agape with laughter and that is the story of the first Halloween.

      I've been coming to this site nearly everyday who knows how many years, mooching off this guy, demanding to be entertained. Yet all I've done in return is bought one Huuugs shirt, one What The Hell People shirt, two pint glasses and a Current Baby Status book.  <br/> 
The first strip I saw was the one where Ray was yelling at LN for wearing pants that were just attached to his legs. I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes! So dammit! I think $3 a month from me to read some fucken awesome stories and see Mr. Onstad post comments along side us non-comic-writing-non-creative-types is not too bad. Here's to you Chris Onstad! Thanks for all the years of entertainments! Here's my bank account details! Knock yourself out! (Though please save me some money for food, cheers).

      And that's exactly why Ray folded on his speech. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maturity? What, you think Ray realized on his own that the speech he was giving was from his punk-ass ass man days? That he realized that in making a joke of his friend's nuptials he was basically admitting that he was not capable of making such a relationship step with any woman? Hell naw, that idea is purported by  <em>untermenschen</em> .  <br/> 
 <br/> 
You'd think Ray would have come to some kind of enlightenment when he got high and realized that getting in trouble was a fake idea, but for the first time in a long time, herd-morality got the better of him.

      Getting in trouble in the main is a fake idea, but I'd bet my bippy that low speeches in front of old school family at nuptial events would bring a shower of real grief on someone.  Whether it be the speechifier, the selector of the speechifier, or the soon-to-be missus of the speechifier is open for debate - in any case, I'd just as soon submit to the morality of the herd on this one.

      In other news, I love the look of wide-eyed wonderment on Phillipe's face. I like to imagine that Ray did in fact choose to read his original speech, and Phillipe is amazed and overjoyed to learn about Ray's endowment. IT'S POSSIBLE.

      Ray is  <em>sooooooooo</em>  lucky he tried his speech at the rehearsal dinner, I decided my speech was crap on my wedding day and tried to wing it. I was going to make a joke and that joke seemed so lame I couldn't bring myself to do it. It pretty much ended the same way as Rays, then my best man got up and used the same joke I rejected and got a huge laugh. Luckily my wife is a non-traditionalist and gave a great speech to finish up.

      Wedding rehearsals are quite possibly the most stupid thing in the world. By all means have a get-together the night before the wedding, but doing the speeches and vows? Dumb. <br/>

      Because the above is not really an example of irony; irony is when something is especially incongruous.  There must be some sort of gap between what you expect and what really happens, or what someone says and what they mean.  Alanis Morisette's song suffers from her listing several examples that have nothing to do with irony.  Similarly, Teodor not finishing his to-do list by the time he's got to start doing the stuff on it is funny, but it doesn't exactly fit into the definition of irony.  <br/> 
And neither does my face.

      Ray normally has almost no self-awareness.  In this instance, immediate feedback from an audience, on something important to him, was only enough to trigger a too-late realization.  But for Ray, even this must count as a tremendous insight.

greatwhite:"I liked this strip today, it was funny." <br/> 
Beefhaha:"Yeah, I liked it too. Reminded me of my wedding." <br/>

      You do realize there has always been trolling here, right?  If it isn't AIU, it's retardo, or asherdan, or whoever the fuck decides to step up to the place.  If there was a forum for complaining about AB, there would be some cockslice there to chat up how awesome it is, and how it's funnier than anything Orzenblatz is doing in the comic.  Trolls are a fundamental constant.  Just ignore them.

      Isn't there some other Achewood message board that is pretty much what you describe?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anybody who thinks this place is getting u-u-u-ultra trolled needs to venture out into the internet yonder.  We've got one or two that are more or less just lame, and a few that can actually produce a chortle more often than not.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, really, we've got it pretty good.  If you want to see a place ravaged by trolls, check out the Cars roleplaying community.   <br/>

      I have to say, coming from a family where at family reunions, if you are older than sixteen, you must be constantly holding alcohol in order to avoid endless questions such as "You aren't drinking, your liver ok?", "Oh my, are you sick, dear?", and "Where the fuck is your beer?" -- I cannot wait for the open-bar adventures at Beef's wedding. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even if weddings don't plan for an open bar, one usually appears, leading to wonderful misadventures and hysterical drunken-story sharing about stumbling relatives. Every one of my family weddings ends up like that, and if Achewood includes it -- that will be one hell of a strip.
