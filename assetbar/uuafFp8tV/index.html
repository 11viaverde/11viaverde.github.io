      I must disagree.  Because  <em>Gone with the Wind</em>  has plantation owners named "O'Hara," there is the erroneous assumption that the Irish (or other Celts) owned slaves.  It was only the landed Norman types that were slave owners.  Not the lowly working class Celts like Irish Catholics or the working Welsh depicted here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of note -- Black Americans had the right to vote and own land  <em>before</em>  the Catholics in Ireland.  Further, Many African-Americans have Irish surnames because they shared the ghetto as the two lowest rungs of American society (and inter-bred).  <br/>

      There was some, but any Irish American who tries to cast his lot along with African Americans in terms of historical subjugation is really,  <em>really</em>  reaching, I think. What they went through can be more easily likened to what the Morons dealt with. It wasn't pretty, but they didn't exactly come here in shackles or anything and the ensuing century was obviously much kinder.

      I was attempting to reference the Know Nothings, but I was worried that it was far too broad and subtle to be recognizable. Guess I was right. <br/>

"Homer vs. the 18th Amendment" is a great episode filled with classic moments, but I still say the St. Patrick's Day decorations at Moe's including a sign saying "No Irish Need Apply" was the best moment.

      Bit of a sweeping statement there. There's no denying that the Catholics were treated horrendously by both Cromwell and the crown but the Empire was built by Scots, Irish, English and Welsh and all took part in the slave trade. Both Scots Irish and the famine migrants fled to the colonies and the New World to start again, and owning slaves was a way of life for those successful. Slaves were traded in Cardiff and there were plenty of valley boyos running plantations in the southern states. It would be nice to say "only the English owned slaves" but it didn't happen like that.

      The perfect time to meet a stranger is 8 in the morning. If you like them, you can go for a walk in the park together at the nicest time of the day, and if you don't you can pretend you have to go to work. Sadly however no-one ever meets anyone else at 8am. We all meet each other late at night, in dingy pubs and nightclubs, and all we want to do is go home so that we can get up early and go for a walk in the park, on our own.

      I've been thinking the same thing all my life. The truth is, belgand, there are some people that are just not cut out for meeting people at loud drinking establishments, and we are those people. When I get drunk, I don't gather the courage to go up and talk to random people - instead I just get pensive and melancholy. I am also horrible at making conversation about topics that I'm not sincerely interested in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only time I can recently remember being on the receiving end of a random approach went something like this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>I am at a bar with some friends. I have just ordered a Brandy Alexander and am making my way back to the table.</em> <br/> 
Random Girl: *looks at me while mumbling something that I can't hear over the loud music* <br/> 
Me: ...huh? <br/> 
Girl: I said hi. <br/> 
Me: Oh. *pause* Um, hi? <br/> 
Girl: What's the matter, no one's ever just randomly said hi to you before? <br/> 
Me: No, doesn't really happen very often. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't remember what happened after that - I think I asked her name out of politeness and she answered something I didn't hear, she asked me if I had been to some pub or other to which I shook my head, and then she excused herself to go to the bathroom. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really cannot imagine it unfolding any other way.

      It is, perhaps, also complicated by my teetotaling nature. I do not, as a rule, go to bars or such unless there is some other reason to be there which often means I am in the company of friends who are drinking. Perhaps it is also relevant that I have been dating the same woman since I was 19 and thus have had no chance to try and pick people up in such a situation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, if someone just came up and started talking to me in basically any situation I would find it really weird and try to avoid speaking to them further. It's just... that's not something that people should be doing. It is impolite and bizarre. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've never fully understood how exactly people go about making friends, especially as adults where you don't really have a lot of opportunities to interact with people in such a way that you would have a chance to get to know one another first.

      I dig on the fact that you've been dating the same girl since 19 - I've been with the same girl since 17, and we're continuing the relationship through college.  This does make the whole meeting people a bit harder, but it's far from impossible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To be honest, you'll never meet ANYONE if you aren't at least a little bit open to strangers and random conversation.  Looking back, my good friends in college have been made from first random conversations and just hanging out/spending more time with people.  Group settings (hopefully not, but sometimes unavoidable, are bars and huge loud parties) are good places for this, but I've had people sit down at my table and strike up a conversation, or sit with people I didn't know very well from other meetings. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You just gotta be  <em>friendly</em>  in order to make a couple new friends.  No one even remembers what you first talked about, or really probably cares, unless it is super memorable.

      I don't know if AIU is joking or not, but Facebook and Myspace etc are terrible places to meet new people online.  The best thing to do is to get involved in an IRC channel or join some kind of forum.

      No, aperson has a pretty good point there, actually. Have you followed sje long, plummet? I like the little guy, but anybody can see that he needs to get off the internet. <br/>

And are you quite sure you wanna try to downplay or ignore the obvious and sweeping differences between, say, how aperson and I grew up and how, say, you and sje spent your time as little kids (last week)? The "internet generation" is about the least made-up thing I can think of.

      Thanks :) <br/> 
I honestly do have an Internet addiction (or, at least a problem).  And yeah, there is definitely an Internet generation.  I don't know how you can measure this, but it seems like the vast majority of the people online are between the ages 16 and 24.  Around that point (mid twenties), it seems to significantly drop off. <br/> 
I didn't, however, spend my entire time online as a kid though.  One and a half years ago I didn't know what a browser was and I only went on to do homework (which was almost never).  I was addicted to vidjo games and television back then.

      I don't know if I'm really an "out there" person. I mean, it all depends on the context. Most of the people who know me in real life except for two or three of my closest friends would probably describe me as relatively normal, if somewhat quirky and over-analytical. This is because I save all my really weird opinions and diatribes for venues like the Internet, where it is my tendency to magnify their weirdness, simply because it makes for more interesting conversation than "Dude, me too!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Regardless, belgand and I are significantly older than sje. The Internet didn't really become a way of life until I was in high school, and probably later for belgand. Meanwhile, I remember watching the other kids play in the yard when I was 5 and trying to figure out whether they experienced everything "in first-person" like I did.

      Not really. I was a BBS person in middle school. But, yeah, I get where you're coming from. I strongly remember the pre-Internet age. I certainly did my share of typing on a typewriter and I spent a lot of time looking things up in a card catalog. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had the same problems though. I remember being a little kid and standing around immobilized for a while because I was trying to work out how my body moved without me specifically thinking and directing every single motion it made. How I can walk just by kinda vaguely having an idea that I want to be somewhere over there and being basically out of the loop mentally about the whole thing. <br/>

I wasn't warped by the Internet any more than Frank Zappa was.

      I was a pretty philosophical minded kid (still am, I guess, even though I'm mostly too lazy to have a significant amount of knowledge on the subject) and I like learning, and have a somewhat solipsistic (not in the literal sense)view of the world, thinking that I am nothing now, but will become something important--necessarily--in the future, whether it be good or bad.  I've wondered how my body moved without me thinking and stuff.  It was more fun to me than going out and meeting people.  I have pretty much the social maturity of a twelve year old, and found out recently that peopel exist and can be fun to talk to, but they are less scary if you can't see their faces. <br/> 
Fine, I am out there.

      I think you and belgand compromise one group: those who are already weird when then come to the Innernet (and me too, I used to feel the earth rotating).  Another, perhaps larger group includes those who become weird because of the Innernet.

      I do not know why, because I'm not a very social person, but I have met a number of excellent women at drinking establishments (this is how I met my current girlfriend). Things always turned out best on more "chill" nights, when I got a bug up my arse and a couple of ciders in me and decided to make an absolute fool of myself for the fun of it and started singing "C is for cookie" at a rather pretty young lady. She totally dug it.

      'Course, a lot of present-day rap doesn't technically rhyme.  It's powered by couplets whose end words are either erroneously thought by the author to rhyme, or deemed by him/her/them to be close enough.  But so far I've avoided mentioning this to the many, many professional MCs I come across in my daily life.  It would be impolite.

      Are you referring to a rhyme like gat/back?  A couple of words that are not technically rhymes because the ending consonant is different?   <br/> 
It sounds a lot better than slant rhyme, such as "rhyming" the words "on" and "moon" or "bodies" and "ladies".   <br/> 
I hated that in English Lit.  It did not sound good at all.  Assonance>consonance.   <br/> 
And yes, it does sound close enough. <br/>

Slant rhymes sometimes work though because that's kind of how they used to pronounce things I think, like how sometimes been rhymes with bean or again with rain.  Stuff like that.

      But this isn't the case.  It's really not a dialectal thing. It's a type of device used in poetry, on purpose, even today.  Because I am from the same region that Emily Dickenson is from, and I really don't think that the language has changed so much in 150 someodd years.  The Great Vowel Shift was 400 years ago, I believe.   <br/> 
I mean, I'm not totally against the idea of consonance.  If can sound cool.  But assonance imitates actual rhymes so much better.  Maybe there is something I'm missing here, but I usually cringe when I see one used to replace a true rhyme.

 <em>I simply do not care for her poetry. I mainly find that her themes are ones that do not resonate with me, particularly the many that are devoted to religion and nature. Though not typically considered part of the movement itself this is one of the reasons why I generally do not care for most transcendentalist works either.</em>

      "Dialectal" is a word, the adjective form or "dialect", from what I can suss.  My problem is that I parsed it as "dialectical", which made it seem odd in the context.  But the word you used wasn't "dialectical".  In conclusion, I can't read, never mind, and carry on.  Please accept my apology for the inconvenience, and I await your knifing with resigned contrition.

Yessir.  It doesn't bother me much, as I've listened to my fair share of rap.  It would be interesting to hear some rap composed by hewing to the technicalities of rhyme and verse.  Actually, the results would likely be bad.  But probably pretty funny.

      I also find this strip to be lacking. The previous ones were good, but this seems predicated entirely on the idea that "stoned people are funny" an idea I find I almost never share finding them instead to be tedious and unpleasant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It actually causes me to look back at the rest of the arc and realize that we haven't really had much difference between strips of "LN invents something in History" and it's feeling a bit old. It's making me doubt my feelings on how much I liked the previous few.

      It's not clear whether Historical Wales had ever been pleased on a blunt. From the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>The medicinal and intoxicating properties of hemp have probably been known in Oriental countries from a very early period. An ancient Chinese herbal, part of which was written about the 5th century B.C., while the remainder is of still earlier date, notices the seed and flower-bearing kinds of hemp. Other early writers refer to hemp as a remedy. The medicinal and dietetic use of hemp spread through India, Persia and Arabia in the early middle ages. The use of hemp (bhang) in India was noticed by Garcia d'Orta in 1563. Berlu in his Treasury of Drugs  (1690) describes it as of "an infatuating quality and pernicious use."</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
And Wikipedia cites a source saying there are 4000-year-old burned cannabis seeds in Romania. So, again, unclear. <br/>

      Alright, I accept that, and there are going to be jokes that most people don't see as offensive at all, but a few people will see as highly offensive.  But there should be a reasonable expectation about things.  People reasonable shouldn't be so offended if someone asks if black people have brown cum, because such a thing can only be asked by a complete moron or a kid who just found out what semen is and is raising an honest question, or someone who is obviously parodying someone quite ignorant.  None of these suggest that black people are inferior or that they should be treated differently at all.  It doesn't promote a stereotype either. <br/> 
In fact, the only one of the three posts that were accused of being bigoted that I actually felt bad for is the "you stupid mexican" one. <br/> 
No one should be offended by someone posting a picture from a book from the 1970s (one that is probably fake, by the way) that shows women in their right roles, unless that someone is saying that is all right.  If you are offended by that, then you are letting yourself be offended.  Not that, you know, saying something offensive is necessarily bad.  It is offensive to say to a religious conservative that his views on gay marriage are dead wrong and are hurting america, but it's the truth.  I don't care what your religion is; being homosexual is not an abomination, and such a belief is stupid.  Of course, social tact counts for something. <br/> 
I know you're not trolling or flaming or anything, but I have to tell you that it's sje lowercase, and that I'm not doing a performance thing.  I haven't for quite a while. I used to be Assetbar Philippe, but now I just say what I want to say.  But a big part of my sense of humor is feigning ignorance, that is true, and I know I'm not that funny a guy, but I don't partricularly care about that. <br/> 
And also, there is no situation.  This isn't a big deal.  And honestly, you shouldn't have made this more public by posting it on the current comic thread. =/

      Merci-bien pour l'encouragement vis-a-vis l'ide d'immigre la bas.  Bof oui je dois bein faire ca plutot vite avant que je soit trop vielle.  J'ai deja 32ans.  J'ai appris en France au lycee.  Mon orthographe qui n'as jamais etait trop bein est desormais degolasse maintennant.  Il faut que je me force a re-etudier la langue.  C'est pas facile quand je lis LeMonde ou quelle quonque, je me sens comme Todd avec la tete qui s'explose... *SPLUT* <br/> 
Je suis pas decider si je veut immigre au Quebec ou bien au Canada.  Bien sur j'aime bien les Quebecois et la langue Quebecoise.  Mais il y aurrait plus d'opportuninite de point de vue travaille si je ne me limite pas au Quebec.  En ce moment je vais me trouver sans emploi dans un peu moins de 3 semainnes, donc c'est un bon opportunite pour prendre un peu de temps pour re-apprendre la langue, et trouver un emploi quelque pars au Canada.  J'ai travailler comme soudeur ici aux etats, c'est un metier qui n'est pas mon premier choix, mais bon c'est un metier qu'ils cherchent au Canada en ce moment, donc, probablement je vais faire ca.  N'importe quoi pour echapper ce pays ici qui est pret a s'imploder *SPLUT* :-)

      well yes okay yes I am AIU but if I am trolling it's not on purpose.  If randomly asking people about themselves is akin to yanking my penis out uninvited and wagging it around, well then I apologize. <br/>

As for my comments about and to lowercase sje57 there, hey, I personally don't feel real strongly one way or the other on sje being an asshole or not, on if his humor is appropriate or not.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was just trying to analyze the whole thing objectively because it's interesting on a theoretical level, to try to see multiple perspectives on the question, something which more people could use more practice on.  Everyone wants to see the world in exactly their own shade of gray.  Random guess:  The people who vociferously object to sje's humor are all Americans, right?  And sje is American, right? <br/>

      i'll tell you exactly what bothers me about sje's attempts at metahumor: they're lazy. just throwing out ironic misogyny and racial stereotypes are not funny; too many so-called "edgy" humorists get away with it by claiming to push boundaries and that those that are offended are "too p.c." no matter how ironic you think you're being, unless you're making some sort of comment about the inherent bigotry of the statement, you're either merely making noise, or, even worse, incidentally lending creedence to those who would use the language unironically.

      i'll refine my calling of the kid lazy with a case study: the lazy comedian has a rich character step in dog shit and the joke runs something akin to: holy shit, that guy stepped in dog shit! that's so funny because nobody likes to step in it, and he's rich, so he's really not used to it. we get a set up but no turn. we might giggle because the sight of a man stepping in dog shit is a little funny, but that's the end of the joke. <br/> 
 <br/> 
a better comedian starts from the same premise: a wealthy character steps in dog shit. but instead of the punchline being "ew, dog shit is gross," the character pulls out his iphone to take pictures of it, then calls his depressed friend to wax nostalgic. a much richer joke, in my mind. much funnier than saying: you stepped in doo doo as if it were some sort of irony. <br/> 
 <br/> 
as for the lending momentum to line of argument, i'm perfectly willing to admit that i'm not above the momentum, part of which makes it so much more frustrating. anyway, i've clearly fallen for trollbait here, and don't want to clutter the 'bar with more of this. my AIM's in my profile and will be for a few days if you'd like to take this argument up in earnest.

      interesting illustration.  hmm well thanks for the offer to chat on AIM but I can't; I would have to install AIM, and I can't; I got depression.  And I'm focused on other stuff right now, like reading about linux.  and re-learning French.  And washing my underwear and socks.  and fixing this A/C. <br/> 
 <br/> 
yeah, your illustration there is good.  It makes me think that perhaps when someone finds a lazy joke to be offensive, it's that combination of the N word (or similar concept) and laziness that is offensive in that laziness is evocative of bigotry and prejudice;  is not bigotry and prejudice derived from a lazy view of, if not the entire world, then one narrow area in it?   <br/>

      The wealthy man steps in dog shit, he looks down at his obviously expensive wingtip that is now ruined with this vile excrement, the camera moves in, slowly, lingering on this sight, relishing his discomfort and allowing us to enjoy a cathartic joy in seeing this bastard who can easily afford new shoes get taken down a bit. He brings his foot up as if to get a closer look exactly, perhaps he cannot believe that something like this could ever happen to him as he is wealthy and powerful and as he leans down to take a closer look he stretches out his tongue and licks it off his shoe taking the time to lap the last little bits off. With a furtive glance around him he walks off smiling and a bit flush. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He was not upset by the encounter. We build up his comeuppance only to break him further by this unpleasant activity having revealed his even more disgusting and unpleasant turbo secret. It is not nearly as we expected and we do not know entirely whether to laugh or be appalled.

      Yes, but the fundamental point by Tripleg is important. Humour generally comes from making new connections that had not yet occurred to you. You need to have something that breaks your expectations and shows a new way of looking at things. A pun, for example, shows a comparison between two meanings that perhaps was not originally perceived and the resulting observation is viewed as amusing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The important thing, however, is what does this have to do with eating shit?

      ACHEWOOD -- A proposal <br/> 
 <br/> 
so um, this sucks to post this here now, since a new strip will be posted probably in a few hours, and no one will really see this, or care, but I have to get this off my chest <br/> 
 <br/> 
right so, anyway, if you look at the 'old' Achewood strips and compare to the 'new' strips, really, I got to say that the 'old' strips have some cool qualities that the 'new' strips lack.  I'm not saying the new strips suck or anything, but, I like the old strips better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
so in the google interview (posted on youtube) wherein Onstad is interviewed in hushed tones by some mild-mannered stoner, Onstad makes reference to how yeah it would be nice to write a book or something (whatever the fuck he was talking about precisely, I forget, but that's not the point) but that he can't well walk away from the cash cow that is achewood.  And he didn't mean that in a vulgar or exploitative or post-modern-commercial sense, he meant that simply in an honest way;  he's got a kid, and a mortgage, and car payments, and food to buy, and a lifestyle to maintain, and so, he can't just willy nilly do whatever the fuck he wants.  Luckily he enjoys doing Achewood, and luckily Achewood brings in enough money for him to make ends meet (and hopefully save towards his retirement?)  <br/> 
anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I gotta say that his various strips on the subject of get-rick-quick schemes on the part of Ray et al. have been healthy for a good part of his audience...  Onstad has explored in Achewood the ridiculousness of not only money but also barter.  It's a crazy fucking world we live in, and we are all the better off for the insight, introspection, and sometimes generally random perspective afforded to us by Achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So anyway, I'm pretty confident that I'm right when I say that the difference between the 'old' Achewood and the more recent 'new' Achewood is that previously, in the beginning, Onstad was exploring the characters, getting to know them, and by this point, the characters have pretty much been worked out, leaving Onstad now with only situations and 'stories' to explore. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So what?  Well, the process of exploring characters, verily, of inventing characters, is a no-holds-barred creative process that can, and often does, lead anywhere.  It's much more flexible, the character and the context of the situation can each adapt to each other.  Along with this greater freedom and flexibility which it affords, this process inspires a much greater creativity.   This is why we got random shit like AirWolf and Keith Moon's head in a jar, and those random threads produces the best Achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So my proposal is this:  Kill Achewood now.  At the very least, have someone else do the art and most of the writing and have Onstad consult on it part time.  Take a break, Onstad, and develop a new strip with new characters, and take them any fucking place you want. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The saddest thing is to be trapped into doing the same job for your whole life.  That is where we are headed with Achewood today.  You see it again and again:  An artist takes the premise as far as it can go, and then tries to take it farther by introducing new characters and situations, but it doesn't work, because the premise is still the same.  The new character or the new situation distracts for just a little while from the overall established premise and from the overall fully developed characters who are the core of this premise, but the new characters and new situations never morph into a new premise.... And why should they?  that's not how writing generally works. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Charles Dickens didn't write Oliver Twist and then just keep writing it and introduce new characters and kill off old characters until the entire plot morphed into A Christmas Carol and then David Copperfield, Great Expectations, etc... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Achewood came out of nowhere, and that's why it was so good - Onstad was not shackled by already developed characters and situations. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I want to care about the characters, I want their story to be told, and I want these stories to matter to them, to further the development of the characters, to be germane to their lives and situations.  Story of Lyle sucked because this is shit that all happened in the past and was the kind of humor that appeals to someone who enjoys watching pro wrestling on TV.  Great Outdoor Fight was good, but a lot of people who thought it was awesome were thinking it was awesome, I think, in the same way that they watch gender stereotype premise slapstick BudWeiser commercials on youtube and find that funny.  Hey, if Onstad finds an audience and can make money okay great, but I enjoyed Great Outdoor Fight because it was just a fucking story, okay, with a plot.  This shit with Little Nephew is no such story because Onstad hasn't set us up with any kind of ... you know... plot... who the fuck is L'il Nephew, and why the fuck do we care about him anyway?  He was always just a prop for Ray, and now all of a sudden he's a character?  It doesn't work like that.  Now he's just a prop for these random people who talk funny which is in and of it's self a prop for this half-baked premise of... ??? <br/> 
 <br/> 
When Ray & Phillipe went back in time and visited Mark Twain, this was a character that was already established in our minds, somewhat, a character of popular culture.  I get the feeling that Molly's father may be quite developed in Onstad's mind, and he has just forgotten that his readers may not have the same imagination as he does, or can't read his mind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
okay I don't mean to rip on Onstad like that, I'm just sayin... what Onstad has done with for example Ray is nothing short of Amazing.  Even Molly is an interesting character.  But this Story of Lyle crap?  What the hell is that?  It's like Onstad is doing background research for an upcoming stint as a method actor and he's dragging me along at gunpoint.  Lyle is and can be a cool character, but we need a story, with a plot; please don't drag me along in a series of non-orthogonal disparate one-liners, each successive one more ridiculous and implausible than the last, until I feel like I'm watching back-to-back episodes of Full House without even the mercy of commercial breaks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I want to come along for the ride as characters endure the human experience.  The most ridiculous far-fetched plots... the time that Ray and Butter grew long legs and walked a heelacopter out in the desert to visit Edison:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110102224519/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=09292006">https://achewood.com/index.php?date=09292006</a>   That was real.  Reality.  Stone cold reality.  The emotions, the confusion, the introspection...  That's as real as it gets.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
To go from that to this present grade-B sitcom-quality thread wherein Urkle goes back in time and gets past Carl to unwittingly smoke a blunt... ya know... that's kinda rough. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Okay maybe I'm being mean there.  At it's worst Achewood is still better than crap American TV, and I recognize that Onstad's character research is special and cool and everything, but shit, Onstad, don't wear a cape!  Don't get a license plate that says "RENFAIR!"

      oh, also - what is this " <strong>we</strong>  did the lie thing again" business?  the strips are signed "Chris Onstad".  Who else is responsible for creating and posting new content?  Onstad, if you're going to be a jerk and lie about when you're posting new content, at least be man enough to take personal responsibility rather than trying to spread the blame to anonymous others.  Now millions of readers are thinking your wife or daughter (lord knows you couldn't afford such as an employee) must be to blame for your lack of punctuality and general chicken heartedness.
