      I call bullshit on all of you. There's no way salvia lasts 2 minutes unless you a) didn't inhale completely b) didn't hold it in at all  or c) it wasn't salvia. Salvia lasts (depending on user) 10 - 20 minutes. And mushrooms don't last 24 hours at all. If they did, they would be way more expensive than they are. Mushrooms visually last (depending on the strain) from 6 to 12 hours. The only thing that could cause someone to trip for 24 to 48 hours would be a copious amount of acid with the mushrooms, and I'm talking like 10 hits of hp blotters and and a half oz. of shrooms, at least. <br/>

      I once got destroyed by vodka and hash. I woke up in the morning with my pants, socks and shoes still on, but no shirt. I later found my shirt frozen solid in the fridge freezer. Apparently I'd had the forethought to soak it in water first so it'd freeze better. Also, I had written things like "I am such a genius" and "go see that movie" on my chest in permanent marker.  <br/>

Less impressively, on Sunday morning after killing just over half a 1.5 litre bottle of vodka, I woke up to find myself wearing just my bra and knickers, and hugging an Oasis bottle. Also, a lot of stuff from my laundry basket had been flung to various places in the room. THERE IS NO EXPLANATION.

      One morning. After many, many hours of drinking. My friends and I came home tackling each other and wrestling down the hall. My flatmate had two mussels in a fish tank that was never cleaned and never contained fish. My friend soaked his shirt up to the elbows and fried those little bastards up and ate them. Apparently captive mussels taste like RUBBER!

      I woke up the morning after prom in my friend's apartment (across the city from where I was the night before) with my tuxedo jacket and pants on, but no socks, shoes, underpants or shirt. i was spooning my friend, who was spooning my friend, and as i glanced at the clock I realized it was about 3 in the afternoon. I stumbled out into the living room and discovered more bottles of Stella, Tilt cans made into bongs, and half-finished cups of sake than I could imagine being around accidentally. <br/>

      There was this party at a friend's place, it was a fairly long time ago. We had drunk quite a lot, so I had to sleep over. In the morning I woke up with a heavy hangover, in the bedroom of that cute girl, all in foetal position. I flung the contents of her laundry basket all over the place, took her clothes off except her bra and knickers, and put her arms around an Oasis bottle. <br/>

      I once drank more whiskey than is strictly healthy for four men. I awoke in my kitchen with my head in the washing machine. The fridge door was open and basically all of the food was not only spoiled, but also squashed and beaten in some kind of drunken fury. <br/>

Interestingly, the pockets of my jeans were full of those little sachets of salt you get free with KFC meals.

      Oh yes.  That is a Thing.  My friend made a steamroller out of a shipping tube, a one-hitter, electrical tape, and that sticky putty stuff. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And speaking of weed in hats, I have an afro-ed friend who once got pulled over while smoking a blunt.  The cops searched his car, patted him down, but didn't find anything because he hid the blunt  <em>in his hair/</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, his name is Alvin.  I think that makes the story even better.

      I have made/taken part in making 2 bongs (Tinfoil, pen, plastic children's drink barrel/evian bottle, tinfoil, zipties, hot glue, both were really more bubblers than bongs), a steamroller (2-liter bottle, tape, bong slider we had around), and this really nice bowl from I think a pen, part of a tire gauge, and some duct tape.  At least one of those i then left, loaded, on the coffee table, near an open window, across the street from my roommate/landlord's aunt's house (No word on whether she came by and saw it).
