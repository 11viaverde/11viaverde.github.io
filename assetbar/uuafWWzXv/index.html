      It has always been clear that the characters know they are in a comic strip. See the strip at the start of the Ray In Hell story arc, where Teodor is telling Ray about what will happen in the next story.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray adressed this once in Ray's Place I think as well.

      I think that what's going on in that strip is that Onstad is portraying his characters as actors - it's a momentary fourth-wall breaking moment in which the characters know that they're in a story and know what's coming next, since they'll be acting in it. Overall, though, I think that 99.5% of the strips portray the characters as unaware that they're in a comic strip.
