[_] Heroic (crushed while protecting group of schoolchildren from stampeding escaped zoo creatures e.g. llamas) <br/> 
[X] Ironic (died of heart attack while participating in charity fun run dressed as giant angry cigarette) <br/>

      Your boobs are the Opposite of Lame.  Those who lamed you would have done so because you linked to a personal site of yours, thus making Assetbar less anonymous and, arguably, less intellectual/arty. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Meanwhile, I like yo skillz wif a camera and stuff.  And the fact that you actually take a lot of photos!  Not enough people do that.  Like, we go "oh, that'd be cool to take a photo of" but then it never happens.  The fact that you do it, and then pull out good lookin' stuff, is commendable.  And more specifically, I like your use of lighting, particuarly the "smoke" photo.

      Yeah that actually makes lots of sense! I did do that, but only when quite drunk and In The Spirit Of Experimentation (just after the handfacething), and then I guess when I was sober it just struck me as a sort of retarded and funny thing to have done so I left it... yeah this story isn't making me sound any better is it. So my point is yes I can see how that would make me look like a tool. Well, I suppose I should say a tit. Ho ho. I do still fancy a break from Ultra Peanut though, much as she suits me.  <br/>

      As far as I know Cornelius hasn't run out on any of his kids either. Cornelius would win the, "I'm ready to handle adult responsibility" Game.  <br/>

      Maybe it was a Waco Kid sort of thing <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like everybody kept challenging him to fights <br/> 
 <br/> 
And one day he hears somebody behind him say "put up your dukes", and he turns around with fists ready, and just as he's about to throw a bonecrushing punch he sees it's a six-year-old kid <br/> 
 <br/> 
So he had to leave to protect his family from the possibility of his being in prison for beating up a kid <br/>

      Here's a potentially contraversial remark. I heavily disliked Ulysses as a whole. It had some amazing moments but Joyce was far too much of a literary nerd to write a coherent piece. I suppose it's place is for other literary nerds. Apparently I don't measure up to that title.

      In one of the blogs, he said that he ate a bit of beef because the doctor told him to or something.

      I'll stand up for the champ and say initially he wasn't crapping on Pat's veganism.  He just pointed out that the guy wasn't eating much and wouldn't be able to drink properly.  He only got hostile when Pat complained about 'modern diet' concerns.  He should have lied and said he ate too much breakfast, or has a parasite, or has the nastiest case of the squirts ever.  Ramses would have shaken his head, sighed, and gone on with things quietly.

      It's sort of a presence thing, you know? It'd take stones to pull that on Nice Pete, but screwing with Pat is just obvious, crass, and unnecessary. He's so eminently pathetic; it's like slapping a petulant child. The situation calls for sneers and later derision. <br/>

All of this kind of points to him winning the GOF by simply beating down a lucky succession of asses; the man has science but no style. He thinks three dollars is a good price for wine. <br/>

      I think it depends on your expectations. Ramses does not have the flair and class of Cornelius, but he is not Cornelius, and does not want to be. If you imagine a socially awkward, two-fisted, strong and silent man of deeds, then Ramses is the paradigm of such a man. He's no sort of father but you'd be damn lucky to have him next to you in a machine gun nest. The fact that his children will always end up hating him is part of his magnificent pathos. It's not as though the man ran off to be happy on a beach in Bali; he's probably spent the last fifteen years eating beef jerky and listening to country and western. Some dudes are too hard to be happy, and only bring pain to those who try to love them.

Okay, looks like Crash (whatever that is) won Best Picture in 2006... <br/> 
 <br/> 
And it looks like Brokeback Mountain was also nominated for that award in the same year. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I will acknowledge that I knew without Google that Heath Ledger was in Brokeback Mountain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So apparently it's Brokeback Mountain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, to figure out who that pufferfish in the wedding dress is.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seems "Alma" was the name of Heath's character's wife in the movie.  (Sounds Mormon, but that's for other searches, other times!) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now let's go back to the IMDB listing ... who played "Alma" ... <br/>

 <br/> 
baffling <br/>

so how are The Jazz doing this year?

      The fact about the movie business or any popular culture, really, is that there can be a huge hit and 95% of the public does not have to be involved.  Thus with  <em>Brokeback Mountain.</em>   I don't go to the movies much, and when I do, it's usually for laughs.  Which I heard were minimal in  <em>Brokeback</em>  although I guess one of the guys is named Skippy or Wayne or something.  I forget.

      As a Melungeon, Emeril has a complicated face. It seems like he is smiling conversationally - not a common trait among modern Californians, but he is from stock with thoughts to occupy them between responses. <br/>

      It's alright. Sooner or later Roastbeef will notice his situation, and take a break from the reception to wheel him off to a little cottage hospital for defrocked priests and disappointed cooks and the like. Then Beef will leave on his honeymoon and one of the nurses will give Teodor a puzzle to do. He won't actually put any of the pieces together, just push them around the baize card table. Over time he will learn to move around and speak once more, but his laugh will never have joy in it again.

      Well, I didn't hear actual complaints about the steak or booze, though I'm sure certain alcoholic family members had a tough night of it. The fucking cupcakes, though, were roundly dissed. It became a Thing. And the location -- in the city, instead of the suburbs -- and the ceremony itself (a Quaker wedding) were complained about loudly by my husband's entire family, who actually had us move up the dessert service so they could leave earlier. They also refused to dance, even though our DJ was really great.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
After they left (we're talking like 25 people out of a 75-person wedding) the party, what was left of it, got a lot more fun. But my husbands' heart got a little broken. And I've been nursing a grudge ever since. I should really get over it, I know.

      I'm with you on the cupcakes.  A well made one is every bit as good as cake, and is perfectly single serve.  Also you can decorate in all sorts of cool ways with them.  If I had my way, they would be the only form of cake we ate.  Or made.  Fucking hate making normal cakes.  Kudos to you.

      That is exactly what I thought. When he finds out that Pat finds whisky to be uncouth then Ramses will have no choice but to lay hands on him. <br/>

Also Pat is clearly making a big show of things by taking only ONE roll, most likely in preparation for whining about how hungry he is later.

As for the racism: haven't you heard? Racism is funny now! If Ricky Gervais and Family Guy have taught us anything, it's that it's okay to be racist if you pretend you're laughing at  <em>the fact that an insensitive joke was told</em>  rather than the joke itself. Nobody's really racist any more, so it's okay! (Seriously though folks, this shit is getting old. You can't keep rolling out the same tired old bigoted fucking bullshit and excuse it on the basis that "we're laughing  <em>at</em>  the bigots, not  <em>with</em>  them!")

      My vitriol wasn't aimed at Gervais and Family Guy, it was aimed at gladi8orrex. I frequently find his garbled txtspk and hidden messages genuinely funny, but the  <em>blak peepl lol</em>  shtick is getting seriously fucking old. The subtext - assuming he isn't just a straight-up bigot - seems to be "Don't laugh at what he said, laugh at the fact that he said it." That's not a funny enough joke to justify some of the shit he says. I think a lot of people, some of them professional comedians, use the success of Ricky Gervais and Family Guy to justify some genuinely mean-spirited, offensive shit. You know, the kind of crap that idiot colleagues forward to every email account in the company, apparently thinking that since David Brent or Peter Griffin or Al Murray can say it on TV, racism is acceptable now. But Gervais et al. use racist/bigoted humour in order to tell bigger jokes about bigotry itself (not always successfully; Family Guy in particular seems to use the same "laugh at the fact that he said it" structure a mite too often - like, I know, Peter Griffin is an idiot, you already made that joke). They are not in themselves racist.

      The Exile gave the best summary of Family Guy I've read, as its #8 Reason they were Ashamed to be American: <br/> 
"Seth McFarlane. It isn't just that McFarlane's Family Guy shamelessly plagiarizes from The Simpsons, nor is it just the endless cheap references to bad pop culture icons. Family Guy is much worse and much more evil than that: an anti-Simpsons antidote for zombies who want to get rid of the annoying buzz of vestigial decency in their rotting heads. They want that decency removed, and Family Guy does it non-stop, scene by scene, undoing the unwanted education all those Simpson episodes forced down their throats with a spoonful of sugar. McFarlane's show reinforces their meanest, dumbest instincts. And it's a huge hit."

      You know what is amazing?  The day the threads after ignored comments NO LONGER interested me enough to unignore. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While it might be true that Gladbags is spoofing the racism, I don't know him.  I don't need to give someone the benefit of the doubt continually, and while I might miss the "Roasetered Befez" smiles, I wont miss the shudder as I finally decode what idiocy is hiding in poor grammer.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The biggest difference?  Ricky Gervais and some Family Guy is, ya know, um... funny.  Changing your schtick from "Undecipherable commentary" to "Racist fuckhead" is not. <br/>

I guess I have one thing to thank AIU for teaching me.  The ignore option works.

      I haven't seen enough Family Guy to comment on it, but the way Ricky Gervais makes racism funny is by expressing it very subtly and making everyone exceedingly uncomfortable about it.  He basically plays a guy who doesn't think he's racist but actually is.  The American version of the Office  fails at this somewhat, because they tend to have people be downright ignorant and offensive.  Basically, they have someone mock a ridiculous accent or say "No, don't eat the rice, it has monkey brains in it because Indians eat monkey brains!"  They basically make the racism so blatant that it is simultaneously less offensive and less funny.

      There were in the more primal days, but they were eaten by the ancestors of more successful tribes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The actual answer is I don't know, but I'm strongly willing to bet there weren't.  It almost certainly wouldn't have been a Eurasian group, as they were very strongly tied to domesticated animals.  Most domesticatable (sp?) species were wiped out in Australia and the Americas, so there is a tiny chance with those guys.  Some strange non-hunting tribe that can't milk anything and just tries it's damnedest to live off gathered berries (hard to farm without animals) and mushrooms.  No nuts, because until very recently nearly all nuts were poisonous.  Domesticated edible almonds and pecans were only around in the past few centuries.  I have no clue how they would get protein.  I still but 50 to 1 that there wasn't a seriously vegan culture ever.

      I've read that the Yanomamo, although not idealogical vegans, have a diet extremely low in animal proteins, as they moved from nomadic hunting to slash and burn agriculture without either adapting their hunting methods or adopting livestock. Men of low status can go months without any protein other than insects, and they have one of very few languages to differentiate hunger from lack of crops and hunger from lack of meat (I'm getting this from memory of a book I read some time ago so I can't swear to its accuracy). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, some new world crops like sump weed, pitseed goosefoot and quinoa (awesome names I feel), had very high levels of protein, which would have made a vegan diet feasible, and almonds were domesticated over 5000 years ago in the Levant.

      I forgot about quinoa, it's a magical thing.  That would cover a lot of protein content.  I still can't imagine a proper vegan diet making it for various minerals in any single part of the world (calcium and iron are tough).  A real vegetarian diet is easy to imagine, and I'm sure has historical precedent. <br/>

Loneal commenting on Finnegans Wake above make me want to let my pedant out too.  Almonds were not domesticated until recently.  They were cultivated, and found edible, but domestication involved being about to control breeding and reproduction, which required grafting, which is much younger than 5000 years.  There are some methods of leeching out the poison (prussic acid or cyanide, I don't remember which) or you can just roast the fuck outta the nuts.  But that isn't domestication.

      I don't want to be the guy having an argument about almonds on the internet, but here I am directing you towards the wikipedia page on the said nut (or drupe), and also towards Jared Diamond's Guns Germs and Steel, which has a very good chapter on the domestication of the almond.

      I've read that one.  And yes, they ate it and grew them.  He makes the distinction that being able to grow it is not the same as domesticating it.  He talks about how long it took to invent grafting techniques, which are required to exert genetic control over trees.  Grafting wasn't mastered until around two or three thousand years ago if I remember, and the almond took a while after that to be properly safe for eating. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Diamond's statement in that book was that there was a genetic mutation that allowed for safe almonds, and that people were able to grow them based on planting the safe seeds.  That's pretty ignorant of the method of pollination, and he's been called on it.  His evidence is mostly the fact that there have been almonds found in Egyption tombs and such since 5000 years ago, which is far from scientifically sound.  There is no account of a safe grafting technique from that era, and unless they had a way to absolutely ensure which pollen went to which tree, they couldn't possibly have managed to actually grow domestically. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Underlying message here is not to believe everything in that book.  It's a great intro to some deep geography/sociology links, but his methods are debatable even by sociological standards.

      It's a big feast and dude is eating just a single roll.  That is gonna get people's attention.  Ramses didn't pick on the guy, just axed him a straight-forward question.

      I think it's a combination of Pat being extremely pick-on-able, and Ramses being the kind of guy who just can't resist picking on him.

      Pat was probably standing there with an empty plate and a pissy-face, however, sort of a silent protest.

      I think Ramses is one helluva cool and tough guy, but that he perhaps gets a bit too much cred.  My reasoning is that when we first met him he was telling Ray and Beef that they had absolutely no choice but to finish TGOF with a severe beat down of Beef.  He didn't take into account the possibilities Ray saw. "I'll see ONE of you later"  were his parting words.  Ray's response was "Bring on the goddamn jeeps!  Become the ruling body dude!"  I'm not saying Ramses isn't cool as ice or worthy of a lot of respect, I just think Ray is the real man. <br/> 
 <br/> 
BTW, since this is my first posting, I want to say that Achewood in its entirety is unbelievably great, but Cartilage Head, The Great Outdoor Fight, and the Phillepe/Transfer Station (which were consecutive, are probably the greatest series of web comics ever.  I am a bigtime reader of classic lit., and I swear, those three arcs border on Steinbeck, Woolf, Chekhov talent.  That might sound gushing, but I believe it. <br/>

      Ramses is a monster truck. Ray is a dune buggy. Both have different strengths and weaknesses. Ramses drives over the mountain, Ray find the abandoned train tunnel through it.

      I prefer to think that Ramses is a hammer, and Ray is a multi-tool with <br/> 
- a pair of wire cutters,  <br/> 
- one of those plumber's snake things, and <br/> 
- a wallet with $600 million in it.

      It is undeniable that when we first saw a meeting of Ray and Ramses, Ray basically kicked his ass, yes.
