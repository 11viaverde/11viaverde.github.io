      People who feel the need to fuck with telemarketers really need to find more things to do in their spare time, like jack off or something.  It has to be more rewarding.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
When a telemarketer calls me, I simply says "thanks, I'm not interested" or "Sorry, I'm pretty busy right now" and hang up shortly after.  I don't want them eating up my time, but I also don't want to be overtly rude to them, because many of them are precisely what you said: people just trying to make it through their day.  Their job already sucks, why in the fuck would I want to make it any worse for them?

      Because I don't want to receive their calls. I don't want to be sold yet another product or service. I did not give them my phone number and ask for a sales pitch. So why not waste a little of their time if it amuses you? Why not inconvenience the people who make a living inconveniencing the public?

      Yeah, because these guys are making the big $ calling you.  Why vent at the little guy?  Are you the kind of person who yells at the cashier at a store because the prices are too high, as if they have anything to do with it?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're big into impotent rage, then go ahead, I guess.

Man how could I NOT pull a Telemarketers Anonymous on the guy? I think I'm too nice. <br/>

      Once many years ago, when my mother was merely a child, a telemarketer called my grandfather. The telemarketer was selling windows glass, or something to do with windows at any rate. My grandfather then launched into this big long story about how he and his family were all mole people who couldn't have windows becuse they lived underground and sunlight would pretty much destroy their eyes. Apparently he just went on and on, providing the salesman with lots of details about being a mole person. Eventually the telemarketer hung up.
