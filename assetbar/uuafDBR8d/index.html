      Well, I'm seeing a good trip here. <br/> 
I have no doubt that Onstad drawing a bad trip would leave us all mentally scarred for life, so it is probably just as well he doesn't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
... Duuuude... this is bringing me back to the time where I had a really bad trip and spent two hours just tying my shoe-laces (on one shoe) because my memory kept cutting out every 2 seconds and I'd forget what I was doing. I was hella terrified of everything, and just wanted to get my shoes on so I could run outside and escape. In the end I just collapsed on the kitchen floor with one shoe tied and closed my eyes until it all went away.

      Canadian weed. Not sure if that was what did it, but it was quite different to the sort I was used to from back in Wales. Its effects were most unwelcome and made for a thoroughly unpleasant experience. It was quite strong, at that. <br/>

      Yeah, I actually don't know how someone really has a bad trip on weed. I mean, sure, maybe you get so high that you black out and do a bunch of very stupid shit, like laugh ferociously at the laughter setting on a keyboard, or eat far too much of the host's food, but I've never had a 'bad' trip. Then again, I know people who say they have too, so it's probably possible.

      Could be that the plants had been fed strange chemicals, or grown up under different conditions to scew the ratios of the right natural chems in them. Could have just been that there was more thc per volume than I was used to. Might not have been the weed itself at all, but due to the fact I was smoking it outside in Canada in the middle of winter. Who is to really say? <br/> <br/> <br/> Fact was... weed I'd had before had generally just mellowed me and screwed with my balance before, but that particular case seriously screwed up my memory for an indeterminate amount of time.

      I'm not 100% sure about this, and no one is going to be reading this comment by now, but "expression of habitation" sounds very much like a particular concept from Heidegger's "Building, Dwelling, Thinking." Onstad has mentioned Foucault before so he must be at least familiar with this sort of stuff - I wonder if this was actually what was on his mind while he was writing the strip. <br/>

      Though Ray does have a crush on being high, I get the impression that he's not exactly a habitual "toker." He seems to depend on Teodor to smoke him out (which, being the multi-millionaire that he is, seems kind of shabby - but that's a story for another time). I don't care how good their stuff is over there, if you get stoned all the time, you stop acting like this eventually (unless it's laced with PCP, or something - but that's a story for another time). However, this is exactly what it's like to the occasional user, especially if the shit is "The Fire." This arc makes me jealous and nostalgic for the times when I was just starting out and even the shittiest Mexican brick weed (which was all there was, then) would send me into this sort of intense reverie for hours. Don't get me wrong - my love affair with weed continues. But my behavior is much closer to that of Teodor; definitely having a good time, but totally (and hopelessly) under control.

      Two great things that aren't simply "L@@K INTO YOUR PAST": Teodor's speech-bubble is actually behind his head, because it doesn't matter what he is saying - Ray is talking about CAMPING. Also. How great is it that you can always hear the dialogue in your head, spot-on, as it should sound? Talent. Pure unbridled. How else could you laugh for so fucking long at a line like "I'm gonna go into the garage and smell metal stuff. Instead."?
