      I don't to be too pedantic about this, because this is a  <em>self-regulatory</em>  forum on the  <em>internet</em> , a comparatively vibrant one, and the thing democracy does best is disappoint you about human behavior.  But I do wish some of the angrier threads could be collapsed or something, or that, just once in a while, people wouldn't feed the trolls just because work is boring.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Again, this is not to be pedantic, because fuck if I haven't posted some pictures of horses with dogs' heads and other shit.  But far more often than not, we do manage to elevate this forum out of the usual genetic refuse of anonymous internet posting and it  <em>would</em>  be nice if we, somehow, managed to not be total dicks more often.

      There is only one viewed strip, so it is not the same account that has already posted a few times recently.  However, this does not mean that the person isn't part of the achewood teacm.  I think that it is still likely that this is a person we should listen to.  What the person is saying does make perfect sense.  I'm sorry, all, for posting that picture of the Doug/Skeeter/Patti Wobbly H.  I won't do it again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let it be known, though, that a lot of traffic, probably, is from us Assetbarians checking new comments.  However, traffic does not neccessarily mean more people buying from the store.  It does mean more loyalty, however. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do hope that the new forums will be made quickly, and is somewhat organized.  We can just have two threads, even.  One can be random, the other can be comic discussion.  Because I really love the randomness of it all, but I can understand how people can be annoyed by a bunch of nonsense while other people just want discussion of the comic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I thought that Assetbar was Onstad's creation.  Isn't Achewood the only contractee?  I can't find any others. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess I'll going to TOUAMB, or whatever it's called.   <br/>

      This is bullshit, y'all. I met one Assetbar developer at the launch party and have emailed with another, and they were talking about expanding and improving Assetbar/Fanflow, partially to keep out trolls like this AIU fool who is posing as admin right now. I somehow doubt Onstad would have invited his Assetbar dudes to the launch party if he were about to cut them off.

      Also, since I am up near the top of the page here, I just want to say that if any other Assetbastards are going to the GOF launch party on Saturday, you should come say hi to me, because I don't know what you look like, but you probably know what I look like from my old avaticon. I will take the form of a small blond girl with a nose ring, standing next to a tall, thin, goateed boy.

      Someone called Marc Antony "king of the goats" in an episode of Rome that I watched last night, referring to his pronounced and wild libido, which seems superficially appropriate, what with the horns/hooves/beards, but really "king of the goats"? He wasn't eating a hockey stick, tire, etc., he was hitting on a houseservant. "King of the rabbits", maybe? If rabbits had impressive horns, they'd dominate the sexual simile scene.

      Goats are pretty fuckin' awesome.  Seriously.  I'd much rather be "King of the Goats" than "King of the Rabbits". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know which throne would be more unstable.  On the one hand, a male goats' weapons are rather obvious and they butt heads to fight for ze wimmenz.  But on the other hand, rabbits can be pretty damned violent, if  <em>Watership Down</em>  tells us nothing else.  Plus, there'd be  <em>so many of them !</em>   And you're life-span would be much shorter. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sure, King of the Rabbits would get hella more sexin' - but how much more than the average peasant?  They're frikkin' rabbits, after all*  And after a while it'd surely mean nothing anymore, sorta like if you were a pornstar: surely, a sure-fire way to ruin your sex life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
King of the Goats all the way. <br/> <br/> <br/> *See also: King of the Squirrels.  Totally unprotected and  <em>everything.</em>

      Believe it or not, I had no idea where this was from.  I am not one who is a fan of anime in general.  Not against it, just not really into it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am, however, a fan of the wonderful calibre of wrestling from the Far East.  And upon spying on another forum an avatar of some kind of anime wherein a chick was giving a dude a Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex -  <em>I just had to have it .</em> <br/>

No, no: the moves that chicks made up 15 years ago, most white guys in Western Wrestling are still shit scared to do. <br/> <br/> <br/> (for further knowledge as to why this move really hurts and most guys are too pussy to do it, realise that your arms are what breaks your fall and keeps you from being winded.  From that height, you're gonna have a bad headache if you fuck it up just a bit.)

      If my understanding is correct it would most accurately be "Suck my penis, cuckold". Not a common insult in English, but I guess if one is to assume that the spouse is a metaphorical the concept of insulting one's masculinity and sexual prowess is pretty standard.

      Yep, it sure does put a glint in my eye and syrup on my sundae. Slams some song in my throat and slips some sweat on my palm. Pumps some gas in guts and slides a bit of polish on my prosthetics. An Astair in my tap-step and some wild geese in my winnebago. Some dangerous, cancerous additives in my moisturizer and some Italian accent in my barber's semi-coherent, enraged mutterings. Packs some cordite in my Easter Eggs and puts some curry on my cowlick. Puts some moral ambiguity in my overwritten noir-pastiche short stories and some Roma tomatoes in my garnish.  <br/>

      Dude, that last post was a bit harsher than meant. I was literially laughing my head off as I wrote it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd have said so sooner, but part of having a life to really live means not being in front of the 'puter 24/7, so now is the soonest I've been able to get back with ya'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let me clean up a little with ya'. I'll start by saying what is so for me: I almost always enjoy reading your posts. Your voice and input have made a difference for me in reading comments before I even had an account here. You are one of the last folks here I would want to authentically offend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My only question: If the "catty" remarks really put you off that much, why would you  <em>start</em>  with a threat, especially one as ineffectual as that, before you tried just sharing with me how that strikes you? Or was it just meant for humor? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dude, help me understand.

I've finally caught up with all the comments I'd never looked at since the handfaceweekend when my inbox turned into a non-negotiable wasteland. I discovered that a couple of months back I gained a stalker by the name of atticusonline, who may or may not still be stalking me, and that an uncomfortable number of my posts seem to have been chubbied purely because of my Redhead Female status. Seriously. One time, someone said something, and I said "Ditto." and got like four chubbies for it! Come on, guys. Come on.

      No way! Its not like I'm trying to piece together two closely related sentences together. I just made a complex sentence. If you used a period or a semicolon it wouldn't flow as well; it would be all choppy.

      It was a joke.  I get what you're saying in that language changes over time, but there is good change and bad change.  The changes that are happening to the language are happening due to lack of knowledge or people not giving a shit about their language.  These are not changes that are coming up naturally, people are just disregarding any sort of convention.

      No, that's what I'm saying.  I think that a lot, if not all, of the changes that happened naturally happened because of people defying convention. <br/> 
Contractions used to be slang once.  Now they are accepted in everything except formal papers. <br/>

      What really pisses up my leg is that facebook uses "they" to refer to a single person  <em>whose gender is right on their profile</em> /. "Social networking" sites are obviously only free in exchange for tons of clandestine data mining, so don't fucking act like you don't know! I'm softening on the singular "they" thing, but I prefer to just switch between "he" and "she". It's funny how shocked people are to hear someone simply say "she" when referring to a non-specific singular person.

      That's because dudes are the default gender and ladies are a special case. Even though women make up slightly more than 50% of the world's population. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like "they" because for me, gender equality trumps grammar. I wish there were a grammatically correct version, though. That "ze" and "hir" stuff is pretty interesting, but it's not widespread enough for me to use without getting stares even more incredulous than the non-specific-she stares.

      True, but "ze" and "hir" aren't gender-neutral as far as I understand them; they're used by some transgendered people who feel they fit their non male/female gender identity. Because of that, they're poor selections for a  <em>universal</em>  gender-neutral pronoun. That's one of the attractions of the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100112110337/https://www.utne.com/2008-01-14/GreatWriting/Peep-Yo-Baltimore-Students-Invent-Gender-Neutral-Pronoun.aspx?blogid=38">"yo"</a>  phenomenon I wrote about a bit further down. I sympathize with your position that gender equality trumps grammatical accuracy, but I have to admit my inner pro-feminist is still duking it out with my inner grammarian.

      Yeah that is the main use of "ze" and "hir" right now, but I think that's simply because even the people who are queer and feminist and shit still usually identify as a certain gender. There's no reason "ze" and "hir" wouldn't find greater use in a society where gender became less important. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also just read this book where they used "person" instead of he or she and "per" instead of him or her, which I thought was kinda cool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And that "yo" stuff is pretty cool, too! Any effort toward gender equality is pretty cool as far as I'm concerned.

      Yea, a lot of the philosophy papers I read specifically use "she" as a general/neutral pronoun. But I don't think this is an improvement - it strikes me as a contrived attempt at political correctness and calls obvious attention to the problem. I would gladly use 'they' if my professors considered it correct; until then I will continue to use 'he' precisely on the basis that it comes naturally and it's what I've absorbed reading everyone from Plato to Oscar Wilde.

      Not wrong.  Look up Barr bodies somewhere reliable.  Women have 45 functional chromosomes, and one inactive in the Barr body attached to the side of the nucleus.  You can see it for yourself if you have the right stain and a really good microscope.

      Not quite correct; it doesn't float off.  Rather, methyl groups are attached to the histone (protein that holds DNA together), which has the effect of severely reducing expression. The main reason for this is that the Y chromosome has very little genetic material; in order for both males and females to be functional, there has to be some sort of equalization. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One cool effect of x-inactivation is that it doesn't happen until after a few cell divisions, so that one x can be active in one patch of cells and another can express a different x.  Calico cats are a result of this (they get weird patches of colors.)

      Translation: <br/> 
 <em>"Cliques may make you 50% more popular, but daybreak steals 20% of that," says ol' handyman.  "Reconsider that, walrus."</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Commentary: <br/> 
 <br/> 
In this passage, Gladiator Rex reflects on a pivotal moment in his youth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As he paced through the streets, contemplating the devil's offer to make him beautiful and popular for the night of the ball, Glad ran into the village handyman, who gave him the best advice any lad had ever received. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glad turned down the devil's offer, went to the ball dressed in his normal rags, and was teased by the popular children.  He sneaked outside, removed the rags, doused them in kerosene, and used them to set the building ablaze.  As the partygoers' screams filled the night, and Glad ran away as fast as his legs could carry him, he heard the handyman's voice whispering in his head: " <em>That'll do, walrus.  That'll do.</em> "

      Some of these grammar rules being put forth here seem needlessly picky.  What is everyone's opinion on dialectic speech?  For instance, the use of "ax" instead of "ask" or "runnin'" instead of "running" or "cah" instead of "car"? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't have any problem with it, personally.  As long as someone's intended speech is clear, that is, what they're getting at, I see no problem with grammar inaccuracies or any other conventional language error. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I feel that language is not some stasis rock, it's something that evolves and changes over time, along with the people who speak it.  While it is funny when people make awful mistakes, I think we all have to acknowledge that improper grammar does not necessarily make someone an idiot, and getting angry about words being used in a different manner than was intended in the 1700s is like yelling at the tide to stop coming towards you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Either we speak the languages of today, or we remain mute.

      I've spoken here before about accents and whatnot (my first post, as a matter of fact). I speak with a dialect (the stereotypical New York accent) and I probably more often than not say "ax" and other things, but the words I'm saying, say if they were written down, are in pretty dern good English, and I think that's more than enough (I also happen to be an English major).  I throw in little flourishes in my speech, which are a result of my parents and aunts and uncles ("yous" is my favorite, albeit least conscious), but I think we all do, and it's forgivable.

      For spoken English (or, like, message-board English), I pretty much think everything goes. Sometimes it is hilarious and/or annoying when people use a word that has a specific definition when they mean to use another word with a specific definition. But I am down with accents and ain't and y'all and whatever. Non-standard forms of English usually have their own internal rules, and slang is a form of playing with language, not raping it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Written English requires more adherence to standard formal grammar. I am not a huge stickler about ending sentences with prepositions and shit, but for me to take a newspaper article or an academic paper seriously, it has to be written in fairly standard English.

      Agreed about articles and whatnot.  But you brought up a good point about message-board English.  Everyone on this site takes linguistic cues from a cat that doesn't use punctuation, and beyond that, has more vernacular chops than J. D. Salinger.  This site above most should be excused for all our "hell of"s and "all such as"s.

      <em>The lack of a proper singular non gender specific pronoun</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
The word "it" has exactly the properties you describe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, yes, we find the use of "it" on people to be dehumanizing, but only because we're used to thinking of people as gendered and objects as ungendered. In French or German, the pronouns don't have such connotative power because even tables and chairs are given genders!

      Yet, in French they have a perfectly good neutral pronoun for use on people: "on" literal means "one", and is always used in third person sigular conjugations, but can be used in place of I, You (singular & plural), He, She and We, depending on context: "On fait qu'on peut" means "One does what one can", but could replace "I do what I can", "you do what you can", "we do what we can", etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Transgender types often make exclusive use of "on" to refer to themselves and other Transgenders. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Despite this relatively useful neutral gender pronoun, one of the worst things you can call another man in France is "P.D." (said just like "payday"), which is a euphemistic abbreviation of a technical term for a homosexual.

      this 'maybe' she speaks of makes me wonder if isn't the teacher getting taught. i'm sure skrad would have something to say about that. <br/>

plus also, stating that "they didn't know that they couldn't" puts another bee in my bonnet. since when was one unable to invent a new word? waiting for the wankers at Webster's to agree to toss something in with McJob (seriously?) and that new verb 'google'...doesn't seem to be worth the time. <br/>

then again, languages are always changing. i read it in a book once upon a time.

      Well, from what I know of French (which admittedly isn't much) "on" is pretty much exactly equivalent to "one," which means that most people wouldn't use it as a gender-neutral pronoun in everyday speech.  People sometimes use "one" in English to refer to themselves, but that seems to be considered pretentious and awkward.

"To continue with the German genders: a tree is male, its buds are female, its leaves are neuter; horses are sexless, dogs are male, cats are female -- tomcats included, of course; a person's mouth, neck, bosom, elbows, fingers, nails, feet, and body are of the male sex, and his head is male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it, and not according to the sex of the individual who wears it -- for in Germany all the women either male heads or sexless ones; a person's nose, lips, shoulders, breast, hands, and toes are of the female sex; and his hair, ears, eyes, chin, legs, knees, heart, and conscience haven't any sex at all. The inventor of the language probably got what he knew about a conscience from hearsay." <br/>

      Oh God, Mark Twain made me lol: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"For instance, the same sound, sie, means you, and it means she, and it means her, and it means it, and it means they, and it means them. Think of the ragged poverty of a language which has to make one word do the work of six -- and a poor little weak thing of only three letters at that. But mainly, think of the exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is trying to convey. This explains why, whenever a person says sie to me, I generally try to kill him, if a stranger."

      Gender in language, realistically, means jack shit.  It doesn't represent "gender" as we know it - it's just that when different dialects are developing into languages, the easiest non-adjective modifiers that come to hand when describing something are the ones we already have at least two of: sex.  It's being economical with ones speaking, more than anything - something you can't hold against any language, as it is the essence of evolution. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Prime example: in some African languages, there can be up to  <strong>12 different gender modifiers.</strong>   Now, in our linguistic class, we tried - we really did - but even after you bring in all the various diaspora of gender and sex classification, you struggle to get up to 12.  And I doubt that there'd be a large enough amount of transvestites or post-op trannies in small African tribes to necessitate a gender modifier in non-related nouns for the common language, anyway.

      My first thought is that they'd be categories like horses have, where age/sexual status come into it, as they do kinda affect who you are.  In that case you can multiply pre-pubescent, mature, past fertile, or unknown, by male, female, and both(/neuter), giving 12 different options.

      Yeah yeah I suppose blah blah blah,  <strong>REGARDLESS</strong> , the point stands: language genders simply employ the use of sexual genders etc because they are a useful enough analogy for what they are meaning to modify.  Not a perfect one, nor do they generally have any meaning beyond just keeping the communication flowing well.

      Yeah, for some reason I've always thought of "it" as meaning something which is not male or female, rather than unknown.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know if it's all that easy to change the way people speak English, I'd be fine with either making "it" less specific than people generally consider it, or using another word (xe, on, yo, ze, they, etc.). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also appreciate French's tu, a purely singular "you" but from what I gather it's more informal than "vous" which is closer in usage to the English "you".

      No, the English 'you' is closer to the informal usage, though it encompasses both. A lot of European languages have two second-person pronouns. In Russian (vi) and French (vous), the plural "you" is also used for the formal singular "you". In Spanish, they use "usted", which is conjugated like the third person.

      Believe it or not it's possible and legal to get a sex-change operation in Iran.  <br/>

It's still dangerous, illegal or potentially fatal to be gay, or even a cross-dresser, but apparently their interpretation of the Koran does allow for gender reassignment surgery.  <br/>

      I thought English was pretty unusual in that it has lost its plural "you".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
We used to have "thee" and "thou", but they morphed into the multipurpose "you".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some parts of the English-speaking world have come up with substitutes such as "youse" and "y'all". <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some regard these as mutilations of English, but they seem like examples of useful colloquialism - filling  a gap in the language, rather than simply mangling a word out of laziness or ignorance.

      OK. Talkin' French without le Chat? <br/> 
 <br/> 
French Tu-Toi form is singular second person, but is further modified by  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">never</span>  being used for a person of higher rank (except God or a close family member like Daddy) or an unknown person. Vous-votre form is plural second person, so it is always used if more than one "you" is being addressed, but is also used where tu-toi is too familiar. In many parts of France, you will only use the Tu-toi form if A) you are speaking to a clearly social inferior such as a child, B) you have been tu-toi'ed by the other speaker, and even then it might be wise only after C) you've gotten permission. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Historically, thou-thee form in English is equivalent to tu-toi, and vous is the actual origin of English "You". Of course, today one only finds thou-thee in use among closed religious societies (like the Amish) or in religious context amoung those who just like the King James version better. So, for all intents and purposes, You is the only You Enlgish has for plural vs. singular, formal vs. familiar use. <br/> 
 <br/> 
German uses the third person plural "Se" for a formal you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Spanish uses "usted" (conjugated third person singular) for formal second person singular and "ustedes" (conjugated third person plural) for formal second person plural.

Language change is natural.   If you want to ascribe some of it to people being lazy or ignorant about standard usage, fine, but it's still going to happen.   And although there are some conventions - like the correct use of apostrophes - that everyone agrees ought to be followed, many linguistic prescriptions are bunk.   By bunk I mean that they're not actually followed in writing or casual speech consistently, even by everyone who propounds them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There comes a time in any linguistic change process where some people will claim a certain usage is right, some claim it to be wrong, and many are in the middle.   In the case of apostrophes, the standard rules apply, so use them right!   But what's the last time you cooked dinner wearing a napron and them set the apkins on the table?   Those words were once correct, and the change was due to "laziness" - people putting the "n" in the wrong place when saying "an apron" and "a napkin" - but the line has long since been crossed beyond which our current forms are standard.   Is it rape, a crime against the language, to say the words we now use?   No, and the world has not exploded!   No one gives half a damn! <br/> 
 <br/> 
The point is:  Who the hell is anyone to judge linguistic "errors" and those who commit them as irremeably Satanic?   At best, you're a copy editor legitimately correcting dumb mistakes before public viewing of material.   At worst, you've actually got little sense of the history of English or the reasons behind many of our so-called rules.   Well, worse than that, you're just saying "Ha ha, you're a cretin and an idiot and I'm smarter than you," which is pretty nasty behavior. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I used to care about bad apostrophes!   Still do!   But I learned to save my actual feelings for things that matter in life.

      Wise words well stated.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, I still regard Merriam Webster as a cheap little (gender neutral) whore of a dictionary for including words like 'irregardless' with the caveat that 'some' regard it as an error. The upshot of this is that the Firefox's spell-check recognises 'irregardless' and refuses to underline it in red.  <br/> 
It's a slippery slope. <br/> 
 <br/> 
More seriously, misuse of words - such as using 'enormity' as a form of 'enormous' - does degrade the language by adding ambiguity and diluting the meaning of a handy word.  <br/>

Incidentally, Tina's use of "must of" sparked a similar debate last week. What with her behaviour during Ray's emergency and Beef's assessment of her afterwards, I think Onstad must of used the phrase to mark Tina as being of Low Mind.

      In the case of words like "enormity" not meaning "enormousness" and (let's say) "noisome" not meaning noisy, and so on, I certainly agree that it's cool to know the "true" (historical) meanings and use them right.   Having a big vocabulary is the Stuff!   I would even say, in general, that people oughtn't to use "big" words if they are unsure of what they mean.   Of course, everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and also, if one has only ever heard/seen "enormity" in the context of the size of something, how can one be blamed for using it wrong?   Is it really the responsibility of everyone who knows the truth about certain word meanings, usage, etc. to cram it down the throats of those who don't?   (Even if not, I admit it can be tempting, if rude.)   Also, not all who make mistakes are mistaken; I for one sure enjoy sometimes speaking non-standardly (say, double negatives), for the greater range of expression it offers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In general, let's keep the true meaning of words around for as long as we can - as long as there's a chance other people will know what we're saying - because that's cool!   But when a grammar rule is ancient history ("never end a sentence with a preposition" is someone's stupid idea of applying Latin rules to English, and has never been followed consistently by anyone in the history of our language), or impossibly obscure, drop it.   I don't expect anyone to think that "cathode" ought to mean "the way down," even though that's the literal meaning in Greek; neither should someone bug the flip out if I say "mis-chee-vi-ous" instead of "mis-che-vous."   To all the talk among the "educated" about shooting and murdering those who speak differently than they do - grammar rage - I say, chill a bit.   Live and let live.   I'll go on saying the room was noisome and mean it was stinky, you'll go on thinking I meant it was loud, I'll sit here being right and you'll be wrong, and the world will go on.

 <br/> 
But seriously, I think people take the narrow, short-term history approach at language, and you're logically taking the long-term.  But it makes sense on both sides: people want to be correct in their time, obviously.  If ending a sentence with "at" is wrong now, they want to follow the rules.  When in 500 years that might be negligible when English becomes something else, things will be different.  So, I don't know, that's language...?  I follow the current rules is all I can say.

      The reason that I have particular scorn for the misuse of 'enormity' is that it's very rarely used or misused in conversation.  <br/> 
The people who do misuse it in writing or speaking are mainly journalists, or some other class of folks who are paid for their ability to write and/or speak words and thus should know better. They can be blamed for using 'enormity' wrongly, as well as for other people (those in your example) doing so as well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, there's a big difference between speaking and writing when it comes to the development of language. Colloquial English can change with amazing rapidity, but the fact that the spoken language is anchored to a fairly strict (if irregular) set of rules for the written means that it doesn't mutate so rapidly that it becomes unintelligible a few generations or centuries down the line.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
We can still read Shakespeare and even Chaucer with relative ease because of this. I suspect (but don't know for sure) that Shakespeare's plays would have been much harder to understand when performed in Elizabethan English. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now that i think of it, I don't think I ever grumble or act the prick about spoken English of any stripe. It's only mistakes in writing (and almost always in writing that's intended for public display) that actually get my angry-glands juiced.

      I think fair's fair with "enormity". The fact is, it's just a less awkward word than "enormousness", and 99% of people construe it to mean "the noun form of enormous".  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100112110337/https://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1673/">Apparently</a> , use in a sense other than "vast wickedness" dates back at least to Samuel Richardson's  <em>Clarissa</em> , published in 1748. If you want to be semantically safe, you can make sure to use it to describe only figurative enormousness -- "the enormity of the task before us" would be better than "the enormity of the elephant".

      I get that you're just going with the descriptive rather than prescriptive view of language, but that doesn't mean "anything goes". Some linguistic changes are merely changes of preference and that's fine. But complexity and precision are integral parts of a language. In this case, the misuse of the apostrophe makes it impossible to distinguish between plural, singular possessive, and plural possessive. When I first saw that sign, I thought "The Window Guy's what?" There is a similar problem with a lot of the slang that people are trying to get accepted as valid dialects - for example, saying "he done did this" obliterates any possible distinction between the simple past, present perfect, and pluperfect tenses. Sure, people can get by with day-to-day communication using these simplified and bastardized forms, but having them ingrained will prevent them from being able to either process or express more complex and precise information. There's a reason that incorrect usage and slang are prevalent mainly among economically disadvantaged groups.

      When grammatical format of a language (dialect, whatever) does not permit information to be expressed using some particular tense or aspect or whatever, one can express it a different way!   Do you ever feel the lack of a standard future imperative construction in English?   No, because you can say things periphrastically, like "Go to the store and buy me some milk" to convey the same thing.   Do you feel impoverished and unable to express yourself well because of the lack of this form?   No. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course having standards for Standard English is good, and of course some linguistic change obscures distinctions which once were there (in linguistic terminology, making distinctions "opaque"), but that has happened a billion times in the evolution of all the world's languages.   What happens is, new ways of making distinctions evolve.   Languages, contrary to many people's perceptions, don't go from being very complex and expressive to being lackluster and worthless for communication.   It's all in what you make of the language you have available.

      Rape doesn't work, regardless of culture, legality or social acceptance. It is an invalidation of someone's essential being. That has no workability. Please get that I am not saying it is "right" or "wrong" or "moral" or "immoral". I make no such claim and have no such stand. What is moral changes in time. What works doesn't. Things that dehumanize don't work. Not really. Not in the big picture.

      I think you would be hard-pressed to find someone more against rape than I am, but I do not understand what you mean by saying it "doesn't work." Toward what end does it "not work"? The point of rape is to dehumanize and degrade, and in that respect it "works" very well.

      Things that dehumanize and degrade have no workability to them. It may be effective towards these ends (and so in the use of venacular it "works"). That's not the use of the word I am making. It simply doesn't work if it dehumanizes or degrades. Period. Don't understand it, just get it.

      I think I get it. For something to "work" means that it achieves the desired ends. Lechatbotte's worldview, informed as it is by inspirational speakers, simply cannot accommodate the idea that some people can actually desire to dehumanize and degrade others because everyone is actually good and special inside, so people that do bad things don't really  <em>want</em>  to do them. At the same time, he doesn't want to use words like "moral", since that would be too reminiscent of oppressive organized religion and constrictive rationalistic Western philosophy. So instead, he redefines the word "work" in a slippery way and exhorts you not to subject it to logical analysis but just 'get it' on some spiritual level. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't have anything against lechatbotte, but sloppy philosophy just offends me on a deeply personal level. Correct me if my interpretation is wrong.

      Hey Acheman! So, let me submit that you haven't fully gotten me, but I'm not surprised. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So: I completely get that all some folks are up to in thier lives is to dehumanize and degrade others, and that they actually (gasp!)  <em>want</em>  to do these things. It destroys workability in their lives, but how many people have you known who had lives that really worked? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let me get really bold and possibly offensive here: Not only is that what some people are up to, I DON'T KNOW A SOUL LIVING who hasn't spent at least a major part of their lives dehumanizing and degrading others! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your assumption is that my failure to give in completely to cynacism and resignation comes from some sort of "motivational-speaker" (hear "elevator music" of human speech) understanding of human nature. Quite the contrary! I really get that basic, dirty, unmentionable aspect of human nature that we would rather club someone to death than be proven wrong! Man, I get it! I just don't make it mean anything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is  <em>only</em>  in the face of this reality of what it is to be human that a selfish asshole like me can choose to be generous and kind! (And, I still don't make it mean anything.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
You find my philosophy sloppy only because you don't get it fully enough to get it. Nothing wrong with that! Just try on that there's more here than meets the eye. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The people in life who get to have full understanding of things are the ones who are sitting there doing nothing but watching.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
When you watch a game of tag, you can see everything, and criticize those who get tagged. But when you are actually in the game, playing all out, you don't have time for understanding! You have to "get" as best you can where each of the players are, and do your best not to be or stay "it". The result is not only that you have more fun than the spectator, you also really have gotten something about that game that no spectator will ever have. You "get" it, and it's better than any understanding it could be! <br/> 
 <br/> 
You can be as logical as you like (I wasted a huge amount of my life in such persuits), but no spectator has the impact on the outcome of a game of tag that a below-average participant has.  <em>He's in the game!</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Try it on, see what fits.

      When I say "Cute!" it means I really found it to be amusing. When I say "Cute." it is much less commited. <br/>

Sometimes the only way to break with what you may otherwise automatically hear is to alter the structure just lightly enough to have be heard. Quotes do that. I pretty sure that it had nothing to do with being or seeming sagacious, as I am only that in a joke!

      Well, you said it's not a matter of what's right or wrong, but what "works", which could only be taken to mean allowing a society to function on a long-term basis. But then you redefined workability so as to make it indistinguishable from what people usually call morality. That's some pretty convoluted word usage right there.

      What works is independant of time and place. Morality is always shifting. Things that were moral a hundred years ago in Africa don't fit four hundred years ago in Norway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But what works always does, always has, always will - and never comes from a context of valid vs. invalid, right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, moral vs. immoral. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All of those are part of the context most people live in: "There is something wrong here, and it needs to be fixed." <br/> 
 <br/> 
What if there isn't anything wrong? What if it's just the way it should be? And shouldn't be? What if instead of trying to fix and change, we just did things - things that work - because we choose them, not to get somewhere, but just because we choose them. <br/>

      You are not making sense. You're just speaking in vague, roundabout cliches and koans. If there's nothing wrong and everything's just the way it should be, then rape and murder aren't wrong, because people choose them. Define what you mean by "works" and we can go from there.

      Again, I never said there was anything wrong with rape and murder. Further, I never said there was anything right with not raping and not murdering. I said that rape (and murder if you wish) don't work. Just that simple. Anything that dehumanizes doesn't work. <br/>

When you find someone whose life is really working (not a function of fame, wealth or importance), you will see in play what I'm talking about. <br/>

      LCB: if you're going to use words like 'work' in that unusual way (I've never seen that usage before), you need to explain what your implied and unstated goals are. i.e: what are the results for which things that 'work' are efficacious? <br/> 
 <br/> 
For example, if the goal is to obtain some other peoples' property, a campaign of ethnic cleansing can 'work' quite effectively. If the goal is to satisfy one's sexual urges in the absence of a consensual partner, then for some people (rapists) rape 'works'.

      Aperson: I wish I had the skill to just  <em>give</em>  it to you! It doesn't happen that way. Here there is an effort to understand me that lacks the key to be able to. It has more to do with being then understanding, but keep grappling with it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, who you have to  <em>be</em>  to obtain other peoples' property thru ethnic cleansing  <em>is</em>  why it doesn't work. Who you have to be to satisfy your procreational urges thru rape is why it doesn't work. (Authentically, rape is typically more about power and control than a need for sex.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Most people seek power to be and control. They feel like it gives them a standing when in fact they are standing on an illusion. Coercive power may get some results, but in the long run it doesn't work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Authentic power blossoms in language, but is brought about by who you are being in speaking. It only works when what you say happens without compulsion or coercion. You say it, and it happens. Ghandi says "No more war", and then the war ends. It wasn't what he said, but who he was being. (Don't worry if it doens't all make sense. Just sit with it, and let it be awhile, and see what you get.)

      Okay, I think I'd possibly be gleaning a bit more from your posts if I understood all this "working" actually referred to. What is this abstract but doubtless valuable element that one cannot achieve through rape, theft or the forceful attainment of political power? Is it happiness? Moral satisfaction? But no, this discussion isn't about morality. So what is it that defines whether an action "works" or not? If you would elaborate, I'm sure we would all tap our noses, nod our heads with a wry smile and say "Oh, that Chat Botte is one clever biscuit." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Does something by definition not "work" if it's unlikely that a protagonist in the Harry Potter books would do it? Or are you just labouring under the naive presumption that while all the successful rapists and dictators in the world may  <em>seem</em>  to be happy, they are all in fact suffering from deep, surpressed emotional turmoil that renders all of their evil actions less than worthwhile?

      I_Love_Kate: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Years ago my mother used to say to me, she'd say, 'In this world, . . . you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.' Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant. You may quote me."  <br/> <br/> <br/> If you really got  <em>who</em>  you are, who  <em>we</em>  are, and what it's all about, these questions would not concern you (as they don't concern me). Consider that the results you get in life is not equal to your  <em>experience</em>  of life. How often have we heard of depressed and suicidal people who appear to have it all, the absolute dream life, and yet whose experience of life is dismal? And then there are folks who don't appear to have anything like an ideal life, whose days are filled with mind numbing, back breaking work, but who are always content and happy. What do they know? Who  <em>are</em>  they that nothing brings them down? <br/> 
 <br/> 
In that vein, it really doesn't matter to me, or make a difference for me if you consider me a raving lunatic or a "clever biscuit". It's not about me! If I can impart any part of the contentment and workability of my life to others,  <em>that</em>  matters! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am all about contributing to others' workability and ways of being, while accepting them just the ways they are, and just the ways they aren't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, sit with the ways of being in play here, and stop getting stuck on the doing. We always think that it's the doing that gets us the results we seek. I submit that doing only gets us the results we get. Other ways of being create new ways of doing, and hold the key to getting the results we want.

      Chubbied for the effort, and especially the final, absolutely authentic self-inspection. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ya' know, I_Love_Kate, there's an interesting thing that humans do - I don't mean just some humans, but pretty much all of us:  Whenever we are handed any piece of information or asertion, we take that brick to the "wall of knowledge" we've been building since birth, and find a likely spot to shove it and force it to fit. It doesn't matter if that brick  <em>belongs</em>  anywhere near our wall, we will not rest 'til we make it fit! That's what's happened here. I invite you to take the brick I gave you out of the wall (it doesn't belong where you put it), and just let it sit in your lap awhile. It's the beginning of a new wall for you! Some things take time. Just keep asking the questions. If I ever actually achieve "enlightenment", it will be from asking the right questions at the right times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm no guru. I'm just another human being. I can lay claim to some awareness - and I'm glad to have it! I can share with you its possibilities, and point the way to it. I can't make you drink the water! <br/> 
 <br/> 
While I grant my posts are long, they aren't unnecessarily so. I wish it could be said in shorter form! I avoid no questions, but constantly feel my answers being avoided. There's nothing wrong here!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am fully involved in an active and stimulating life. I can think of little that would suit me less than inhabiting a mountain peak visited but rarely by peasants! Frankly, I enjoy talking too much for such a lifestyle! And the things I say have a much more direct application and use then obscure koans! (Although I'm sure the ocelot is grateful, not having butterfly shit in his ear and all.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Age is not important. I would hope for all of you to exceed my awareness much earlier in life! What remarkable lives you would have!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only reason my futhering the conversation looks to you like a paraphrase is that you keep shoving my bricks into the same place. I request you stop doing that, not because it is "wrong" to do it, but because it is causing you frustration. Please, just sit with them, allow them to not belong to the wall you already have. Ponder what they might mean. Give it a day or two. Then we'll talk more if you wish.

      How does the concept of "work" apply to dilemmas?  Situations where inaction is as bad as any choice you may make?  Is that just life sticking it your face, telling you that you may no longer be pure, you will choke on hot sweaty life, and it will change you?

      On the off chance that curiosity gets the better of you: <br/> 
 <br/> 
A) If you ever make "perfect sense" of it, you really aren't "getting" it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
B) Ever notice this happening a lot in your life? People hand you things to ponder, and if they don't fit the wall you've already got, then you simply dismiss the source? Think about what you are missing in being this way about it! Get that I'm not making you wrong. Just something to look at in your life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
C) I wish I had been half as informed and up on it at your age! Let me acknowledge you for being someone who at an early age has already been in the inquiry for some time and already able to express yourself the way you do. Kudos. <br/> 
 <br/> 
D) Batshot? Brilliant! <br/> 
 <br/> 
E) It  <em>can</em>  be understood, but won't be if shoved into your existing wall at random locations. Taken the way it is given, you might surprise yourself! But this is not something you have practice in doing.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
You have learned enough to feel you can relate all new bricks to the ones you already have. You no longer ask the questions, but assume you know. From there, you will  <em>never</em>  get it. (Some folks never will. Some days I forget what I got! What it is to be human.)  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Please note I'm not making you wrong here either. It's an invitation (not an obligation) to keep asking the questions! And to be patient with yourself. I really get that this is asking you to be ways you haven't been before, and that can be annoying. <br/> 
 <br/> 
F) I'll keep reading your posts with interest and admiration, and a solid pull for you having a remarkable life that works!

      Lechatbotte, I'd like you to look at what you've written above through the eyes of someone who is not yourself, and then see why someone would maybe be inclined to call you a nonsense-spouting hippie who's listened to one too many motivational speakers. I don't care about whatever point we were arguing anymore. Just for future reference: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. Drop the condescension. It's made worse by the fact that you completely deny it and seem to be unaware of it. (As soon as you do, I will drop mine) <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. If you cannot state what you are saying in simple logical points, you are not actually saying anything. You may think you are, but you're not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. Restating whatever you've already said in a roundabout metaphor does not add anything to the conversation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
4. You're completely free to go on thinking how sad it is that we're all trapped in our narrow rational mindset and how beautiful and enlightening it would be if we would just stop trying to  <em>understand</em>  and just  <em>be</em>  and then we could all hold hands, and I will go on thinking that you've deluded yourself into a bullshit approach to life because it was considered cool during the time you were growing up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
5. However, if you decide to use written language, which is after all a logical means of communication, please follow its conventions: use words the way they are defined and expect people to demand evidence for your claims. Otherwise, you are free to try to send us all waves of positive aura or whatever to make us see things your way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is all.

      Acheman, I'm not condescending when I say that you really tickle me! Chubby for making me laugh! <br/> 
 <br/> 
1) If I came off at all condenscending, let me clean that up! It may come across in my weak use of words, or my stilted (what was it? oh yes: "quaint and slightly archaic") phrases, but there is none of it in my space here.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am in complete awe of the level of intelligence and presentation that I find here. I am the one who misspells randomly in every post, and smack my head in shame. Nothing but much love and respect over here with the booted cat! <br/> 
 <br/> 
And you never struck me as condescending. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2) If you cannot grasp that any logical system (simple or otherwise)  <em>must</em>  possess blind spots, and give thought that perhaps there might be something there, then please don't change lanes in front of me anytime soon! <br/> 
 <br/> 
3) That all you heard was restatement, and not creating something anew and at a greater depth, may very well explain why this remains opaque to you. There's nothing wrong here, but I would suggest that giving up being "right" about me may hold a breakthrough for you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
4) I don't pity you, or find your situation sad. You are no more trapped - and possibly a great deal less so - then any other human being! I don't get a pass either. Being aware makes me responsible, that's all. But you all occur to me as complete, whole, perfect human beings. Yes, even the "troll". I count myself blessed to be part of this community. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And as for hippies and what was cool in my growing up time, you really speak outside your knowledge. I am one of the squarest guys around. Always have been. My big teen rebellion was not going to church for a year. My body is so unaccustomed to drugs and such that an Advil makes me sleepy. The only reason to bring it up is to show your pigeonhole for me for what it is - not very well connected to reality. Pigeonholes never are. <br/> 
 <br/> 
5) You don't have to accept this, and it won't matter if you do, but I take  <em>very</em>  seriously my communications, whether written or spoken. That's the only reason I'm still responding in this conversation. [b]All we ever have is the precious eternal milli-second that is our NOW and our conversations. Our reality arises in language. Our relationship exist in it. Everything is intimately tied to it. If you think language is logical, then you've never met it on a drunken night's fugue! It  <em>can</em>  be logical, but is under no obligation to be such at any given time. It is what makes my relatedness to you as powerful over untold hundreds and thousands of miles as I would have if we were face to face. I "get" you - in language! <br/> 
 <br/> 
But if that then becomes a demand to return to the lemming field of the resigned and cynical, I decline your request. And invite you to join me instead in possibility of possibility. But you'll never get there "being right" (whether or not you are). You'll never get there changing what I say to match your criteria, or pigeonholing me without proper evidence (clue: there is no proper evidence).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let what I've said be received the way I said it. X = X. Stop adding your take on it (y) to it and thinking that it's still the same thing. Or not. Your choice. Either way, I'm grateful to be able to make your acquaintence, and get a good laugh from your wonderful way with words! Thank you! <br/> 
 <br/> 
(I tried creating a wave of positive aura, but I just knocked my plant over.)

Those guys wouldn't have me, and frankly, they scare the shit out of me! Let me go on record saying that I think Tom Cruise is a tool and a lemming, and I pity him. No matter how much I enjoyed  <em>Battlefield Earth</em>  (the book, the movie was only so-so), Mr. Hubbard was a right proper shister and fraud. <br/>

 <em>Dyanetics</em>  contains some workable ideas, but the way in which it is put into practice by the organisation is not workable. Le Chat recommends staying far, far away from this!

      Chatbot, you are not a moral relativist, so stop pretending to be one. Rape and murder are wrong. You know this, I know this, we all know this. "Workability" is a nonsense term. In every conventional sense of the word, rape and murder  <em>do</em>  "work," which is why society has existed for thousands of years with rape and murder in it.

If you choose a context of "there's something wrong here" or "what's wrong here" then that is so. That is not my context. In my context, no matter what results you can obtain through rape and murder, they don't work. And it's absolutely  <em>not</em>  about right and wrong.

      That way of being is precisely the price you pay! (Mind ya' we're talking murder here, not self defense or something.)  <br/>

Stone cold murderers can't undo what they've done, and may never undo who they've become. (But we can always hope!)

I was just joking with loneal, as I'm sure she knows, and I am nothing like a motivational speaker.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Consider that everytime you dangle that useless title around my neck, you alter the way you hear me in ways that block you from actually hearing and getting what I'm saying. Please observe that none of what I have said has been aimed at motivating  <em>any</em>  kind of action (except perhaps skimming, skipping and laming), and I'm not particularly effective at the speaking of it. (I wish I had more skills in putting into words the "being" in question.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
What Loneal acknowledges is my way of being, which is why she isn't inclined to give me a properly earned slapping. Her "getting" the way I  <em>am</em>  about this  <em><strong>is</strong></em>  the breakthrough I seek. That this way of being is available to her, you, or anyone who wants it is my point.

      I got that! You also got the way I was being with you. You  <em>really</em>  got it!

      More philosophy, less motivational speakers? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Try more being, less understanding. I know you've got no clue what that means, but I invite you to an inquiry into it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, every time you create what I say as being "motivational speaker" stuff, you make it harder to ever get what I'm actually saying. There's nothing wrong with that - you may never get what I'm saying! But I invite you to try on a different listening, and see what's there for you then.

      Okay, fair enough. I'm sorry to keep bringing it up. It's just that the way you debate is very reminiscent of it. You never make a straightforward argument. Rather, you keep going around in circles and restating what you have already said. And you redefine words so as to render your point impervious to logical analysis. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Can we just admit that you are making a base assertion when you say "the kind of person you have to be to dehumanize people just doesn't WORK". You're saying that on some basic level, whether spiritual or psychological or whatever, a person whose aim is to degrade others is fundamentally incomplete. That's a fine thing to believe: I just want you to admit that this is simply an assertion of opinion, and you would have saved us all a headache if you'd simply stated it as such without trying to couch it in the absolute objective language of 'works'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To speak of someone being fundamentally incomplete in this way is essentially the same as saying that their morality is wrong. You don't get to choose your context.

      The context is decisive, and I  <em>absolutely</em>  and  <em>unfailingly</em>  get to choose it! But that choice isn't always readily transferable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You also get to choose your context, and if you insist on it being a conversation about truth vs. (what? error? falsity?) non-truth, right vs. wrong or moral vs. immoral, then that will be the conversation you had, regardless of what I was saying. And there's nothing  <em>wrong</em>  with that! It is a  <strong>valid</strong>  human view. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Will it help if I say that my context is all made up and isn't "the Truth"? Because I am completely aligned with that. But then,  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">all</span>  contexts are made up, and none of them acheive an absolutely perfect knowledge of everything as it actually is and actually isn't  <em><strong>right now</strong></em>  in reality! We all have a more or less invented and imperfect connection to reality! We're all certain that our connection is  <em>at least</em>  twice as good as anyone else on earth. That's one reason why we think we can make some things "work" that don't. Welcome to the human race! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do like what you've said about being "incomplete" and will ponder it. Thank you!

      Lechatbote:  There has to be *some* context.  A human is part machine, part programming.  The machine is the body, the DNA.  The programming is the culture.  There can be so many possible variations in culture that it is really hard, and I would say for any practical purposes impossible, to find a 'universal context.'  You can't even point to physical pain as a universal constant...  Generally people are 'hurt' by things which cause physical pain, but then, in probably ALL cultures, we have rituals which inflict physical pain upon us, and we consider ourselves better off for it.  I think that pain is an essential part of the human experience.  Jack London really captured something in _To Build A Fire._  And then there is death, and in some cultures, death is in some contexts considered honorable and is looked forward to.  All cultures seem to encourage the taking of one's own life in some context or other, be it the heroic Catholic soldier who flings himself into the line of fire in the name of God and Country, or the self-less Buddhist monk who refuses to cooperate with the Chineese and renounce his religion thus ensuring that he will die in a Chineese labor camp. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are aspiring to find a universal context which is free from the convoluted and corrupt and hypocritical ideology which human cultures tend to manufacture.  If you have been working at this for any amount of time then you are no doubt further along this path, that is to say more enlightened, than most of us who simply go about our business and never introspect beyond a superficial level, or at least never in a way that would truly challenge all the institutional dogma that envelops us constantly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But whatever culture and context you can imagine, be it any that have come before in history or some sci-fi postulate of our imagination, is still a culture.  I acknowledge that we can go a great distance towards achieving a better less hypocritical more universal culture/context...  We can go a long ways towards ridding ourselves of all of this hypocrisy, this jealousy, bitterness and ridicule. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Who knows, maybe one day human culture will progress to the point where we are all a bunch of buddhist monks meditating on a mountaintop in a totally balanced zen state.  Myself, that is probably not my thing, you will probably have to pry my mcdunulds chezeburgr frm my cul ded paws, but who knows, maybe my kids or my grand kids might go for it.  So yeah maybe one day human culture will arrive at that, will get as close to being a non-culture as is possible.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But you can't get there from here, and indeed, it's dangerous to try to.  You are trying to give life to a meme of contextlessness, and I think that it is only likely to be misunderstood by many, including possibly even yourself.  Certainly, how many dangerous and damaging religious are based on the paradox of not reasoning and simply trusting one's intuition?  Pretty much all of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am all for moving towards having less context, less fucked up culture, towards moving towards accepting more universal context as the basis for culture, towards going for a culture which more directly and more universally supports the machine which is the body and the building blocks of the self which are the parts of the brain and which supports the self's need for social connection, and love, and attention, and interaction.  I'm all for promoting all that.  The only way to achieve this in yourself and to promote this in others, I think, is to be self aware, and to be aware of others, and of the general context, the general culture, that these others are programmed with...  How do you get there from here?  small steps, perhaps, smaller steps.  It won't happen in one giant leap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Everyone has their own cultural programming and semantics which is the only window their inner self has on the world.  It seems as if you are proposing that we set aside this abstruse filter of the world and go for something a lot more direct and universal.  You know what would help this quest?  A lot of shrooms, LSD, and high-grade pot.  And probably less alcohol.  <br/>

Thank you so much for grappling with my writings and really striving to get it! I appreciate it, and thourouly enjoyed your response. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will make a few notes: Got the whole "human machine" part. It is essential to where I stand. (May I add that I outright  <em>loved</em>  London's  <em>To Build a Fire</em> ?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let me just say for the record that there will  <em>always</em>  be a context and a culture. I'm not resistent to this in the least! I also can't imagine being satisfied in a meditative monk lifestyle, although, who knows? The main reason that a universal context or culture evades us is precisely our lack of belief that it is possibile. Also, avoiding pain and reality leads to many more problems than accepting them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Further, change has never been the answer. The more things change, the more they do not change. History tells us this over and over and over (and over) again. Yet we still think we can change things! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not asking anyone to not reason, but suggesting that we miss a lot by making it the only approach we have to learning things. Watching tag, and writing all about it, will never give you what playing tag will. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Small steps will never get you there, but you are welcome to try it! If it will happen at all, it will be a giant leap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Awareness  <em>is</em>  the name of the game, and the solution to many of the challenges you postulate. When you really get who you are at the level of world, and I mean  <em>really</em>  get it, it all becomes so much clearer.

      You know, lechatbotte, when I went on too long about what I was thinking, about a year ago, I got lamed all to hell and fostered a little cult of spiteful lame-fairies who followed me around until I stopped posting most of the time.

      Thanks for the advice! I really appreciate your wanting to spare others from your previous situation.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've noted my lame to chubby ratio dropping from these long ones. Some things are worth risking it all on! There are thousands, tens of thousands, of readers here who never post. They aren't all reading the comments, but the ones who do only communicate through lames and chubbies. If just one of them, the vast faceless, nameless mass, gets something from reading me that helps them get a life that works, it would be worth being lamed to oblivion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's not to say that I set out with that in mind. I frankly prefer laughing and joking to any of this. But when the topics come up, I gotta be responsible for where I stand on things, and do my best to represent. Hopefully, with practice I'll get so I can do that with brevity.

      I agree, the sign thing is ridiculous.  I walked by one yesterday that read, "Credit Cards Excepted."  It made me want to grab a large sharpie, scale the wall and correct it.  But then I saw another sign on the door that read, "Cash only."  So then my thought was that the sign was correct--but why the need for two signs to say essentially the same thing, especially when one of them is a nearly unreadable handwritten one?  Perhaps they had a great number of people making the same mistake I initially had, thinking that the sign was misspelled, and trying to pay with credit cards, that they wanted to make it completely clear to everyone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Either that, or the people who made that sign were just kinda dumb, then decided they couldn't accept cards...but who doesn't accept credit cards in this day and age?

      This buddy of mine from college went to an all-boy Catholic high school & his group of H.S. friends had a bunch of ridiculous "moves" they invented to inflict on each other in a very male bonding/homoerotic manner. Some favorites included the very popular and self-explanatory "junk check", and the funnier and much more relevant-to-this-comment "credit card", which involved swiping the back of one's hand through another's ass-crack.

      OK, I don't speak Spanish, but I have known, hung out and been around way too many Hispanic people (not that that is a bad thing) and cabron is way stronger than "bastard". Unless you're using it with one of your homies, "cabron" is fighting words. It's more akin to "Motherfucker".

      I'm Hispanic, live with a Hispanic family, and have plenty a Hispanic friend. It is indeed the equivalent to bastard. Fighting words would be "hijo de la chingada" (son of a bitch, mothers being something very sacred) and "puto" (hella strong!).

      It's just generally an offensive term. It doesn't necessarily have to match up specifically to any english words. <br/>

      I had a friend who lived in Spain for a year, and I slightly improved my rudimentary Spanish while visiting him. From what I gather, Spanish curses are simultaneously both more vulgar and more mild than you would think. That is, in their literal translations, they are downright awful things like "motherfucking piss of a donkeywhore," but in their usage they are tossed off casually when someone stubs their toe. You probably still do not want to call someone cabron, however, unless you want to find yourself suddenly involved in a highly stylized and graceful fencing match.

      Yeah, there is a phrase "poner los cuernos," (literally "put the horns") which means "to cuckold." Cabron literally means "big goat," and I guess they are related coz putting horns on a dude makes him a big goat.

      The jury is still out.  It's come down to Sgt. Wallace Petrowzcki from Tuscon, Arizona and PFC Gunther "Gun" Reinbeck out of Dayton, Ohio.  Gun came in second last year and is this year's favorite, but Wally's hip surgery gives him the sympathy factor that many past upsets have had.  E-mail me to get in on the pool. <br/>

Like, what's a semi-colon? Do we need them? Or are they a stop-gap for other punctuation marks that might be equally useful? It may seem odd, but people who enjoy reading and writing like to know these things. As Wilde said, "This morning I took out a comma and this afternoon I put it back in again.".

      In a world gone soft in the head, <br/> 
On the dark streets I fear to tread, <br/> 
The anxiety wraps 'round me like a boa, <br/> 
My mouth's so dry I cannot even scream or say <br/> 
All I know is I have to crawl away <br/> 
 <em>From the devil (evil?) chihuahua.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thanks everyone, this is a little poem about a dog. Hope you enjoy Oslo, a biogrope quick one. (?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
I used to write studies, but I don't anymore. <br/> 
Now I write poems and they're much more rewarding. <br/> 
It was like I was in a room and I opened the door <br/> 
And there was a ship called Poem and I began boarding. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And on the ship it was better than the room. <br/> 
As I looked around all I could say was "wow". <br/> 
Everything was comfy and clean, it reminded me of the womb. <br/> 
So instead of studies I write poems now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lol, my biography was in poem form! How odd.

      I think reading  <em>Being and Nothingness</em>  might be beneficial to you, if you can get through it. At least read the parts on The Existence of the Other and Freedom. If nothing else, it'll make you understand the play better beyond that one throwaway line. <br/>

What would certainly interest me would be if there was some essay which compared and contrasted Western existentialism with the philosophy / psychology of Buddhism...  certainly there is some if not a lot of commonality there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then there is this book  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">The Quantum and the Lotus</span>  by Matthieu Ricard representing the buddhist perspective & Trinh Xuan Thuan representing the Western Scientific perspective.  "a mind-expanding, eye-opening exploration of the exciting parallels between cutting-edge thinking in physics and Buddhism."  I think I'll start with this.

Even worse though, are the ones that just leave their shit at your doorstep, and don't even allow you the cold comfort of sneering at them through the window, hoping they notice you don't answer. <br/>

For instance, the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100112110337/https://www.fellowshiptractleague.org/"> fellowship tract league</a>  left me a charming pamphlet about God yesterday, with a cover photo of the Twin Towers burning.

Actually, I don't know how this works; do gay men switch around roles often?  A gay friend of mine claims he is an adamant top; I don't think he ever got his can rocked (and he's not all new fag or anything, dude is in his 40's)!  That's part of the reason I always called him a latent heterosexual.  That and the fact that he built a spud gun.

 <em>What divas and man to do is best?</em> <br/> 
If you could have an orgy with some female pop stars and a man, who would be the best choices? <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>What orcs IM tonight, just sassied, but two go beyond?</em> <br/> 
A commentary on the rude internet habits of orcs, who, although usually just somewhat sassy, sometimes cross the line and become purely offensive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>I have the Asian War, my ferns, I really do.</em> <br/> 
Addressing his house plants, Glad refers to what is either an upcoming Capcom game or the threat of a new Cold War with China. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>You ghost, to do your Bess, no matter what a night! Be afraid to lose, fail, that's all!</em> <br/> 
Glad takes a firm stand against perpetrators of bovine-related bestiality, particularly those who do not even bother to take the weather into account. <br/>

      What drives a man to do his best? What forces him to not just succeed but to go beyond? I have the answer, my friends, I really do. <br/> 
You go to do your best no matter what and not be afraid to lose and/or fail, that's all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The sun was setting on the Alabama sky <br/> 
It wasn't me but a man was condemned to die <br/> 
It wasn't me but I put the rope around his head <br/> 
I can't be responsible for my own hands <br/> 
As I'm just following commands <br/> 
But I strung him up and that black man is dead <br/> 
 <br/> 
What had he done, what could have been his crime? <br/> 
He wasn't tried or juried we hadn't the time <br/> 
If we'd searched for the truth I'd say we'd find a bounty <br/> 
All I can say for sure is that he shouldn't have been there <br/> 
I thought the sign read clearly <br/> 
"Nigger, don't let the sun go down on you in this county" <br/> 
 <br/> 
This was a poem with race undertones. Thank you all.

      No dickness intended, but I think there is a forum somewhere that has remained more 'pure' strip commentary, if you're really not feeling Assetbar because of it's less-focused and less-organized atmosphere. <br/>

      Yeah, in retrospect, I can't believe I didn't take any pictures. There were dudes with architecturally wondrous facial hair and a girl with a tattoo of a platypus jumping through a flaming hoop, and everyone was drinking the bright blue Drink of Tomorrow, and I somehow didn't think to take pictures. All I have is one small picture of me and Onstad. I hope you will forgive me for this someday.

      Yes that was my dumb ass, too stupid to just go ahead and say "Hi!" misunderstandings be damned.  By the time I figured out that the very cute girl with the extra-vivacious eyes was def. you, I was at the front of the line, and by the time I was done talking to Senor Onstad, you were gone.  Boy did I feel like a dork.  Sorry about the creepy old dude vibe, but it is partially your fault for being so much better looking in person than in photo:  "...that's Loneal.  No that can't be her; that girl is such a fox. That's got to be her. No, that can't..." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, Liz is super hot, and very much fun to talk to.  She told me that Todd is Chris' middle name, (take that you Todd T. dissing chumps out there!!), and that he use to have 1958 Mercedes 220SE that he really loved, and was full of genuine appreciation for everybody showing up and making the shindig live. <br/>

      That's because of a different Assetbar problem, one that Assetbarista doesn't fix (yet). The Ö in your comment is encoded as ISO-8859-1, rather than UTF-8.  Assetbar tells our browsers that the page as a whole is encoded as UTF-8, which is a good thing in general, but the ISO-8859-1 encoding of the Ö means something else in Unicode, so you end up with a nonsense character.

    <span class="comment-text hideable">
      Looking into the ISO-8859-1 problem a bit more, it doesn't appear that a Greasemonkey script will be able to fix it.  By the time Assetbarista runs, Firefox has changed the mis-encoded characters into U FFFD, the "Unicode replacement character" that looks like diamond with a question mark superimposed.  At that point there's no way for a script to determine what the character used to be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suppose you could enter the o-with-umlaut as "% u 0 0 D 6" (minus the quotes and spaces) when typing your comment.  But even if that works, it will only display correctly for people using Assetbarista.

      The display of that character is system-specific.

      Scroll a bit past good old FFFD on that Unicode table page, by the way, and you can see if your browser can display the glyphs from Linear B.  No Linear A, though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I point this out because I recall that there are linguists on this forum, and I hope that the mention of Linear A will bring them as much  <strike>misery</strike>  joy as Unicode has brought me.

      Do you remember the night I held you so tight, <br/> 
As we danced to the wiener schnitzel waltz?  <br/> 
The music was gay, and the setting was viennese, <br/> 
Your hair wore some roses (or perhaps they were peonies), <br/> 
I was blind to your obvious faults, <br/> 
As we danced cross the scene <br/> 
To the strains of the wiener schnitzel waltz. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, I drank some champagne from your shoe. <br/> 
I was drunk by the time I got through. <br/> 
I didnt know as I raised that cup, <br/> 
It had taken two bottles to fill the thing up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was I who stepped on your dress. <br/> 
The skirts all came off, I confess. <br/> 
Revealing for all of the others to see <br/> 
Just what it was that endeared you to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember the night I held you so tight, <br/> 
As we danced to the wiener schnitzel waltz. <br/> 
Your lips were like wine (if youll pardon the simile), <br/> 
The music was lovely and quite rudolf frimly. <br/> 
I drank wine, you drank chocolate malts, <br/> 
And we both turned quite green <br/> 
To the strains of the wiener schnitzel waltz. <br/>

      Old, female, my ass.  I'm a young male, boyo...but not a particularly entertained one.  Honestly...the erratic schedule on this strip doesn't bother anyone else?  Have you all been so beaten down?

      Not beaten down, just patient enough. Dude, you make it magic four times a week, and then talk to us about why it may take a minute longer. I'd rather it came great late then lame early.

      Mamma mia, I missed the reference. But knowing you, knowing me, I have a dream that one of us would get the name of the game. Thank you for the . . . SOS and taking a chance on me, but (does your mother know?) the winner takes it all. So, you'd be a super trouper if you laid all your love on me; but maybe you'd prefer a dancing queen? Or voulez-vous a Chiquitita? Just remember if you go to Waterloo, it's all "Money, money, money" and "Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie", but what can ya' do?

      I couldn't help but notice (in somebody's Flickr collection) that the GOF Isotope drink menu attributes Stella's reputation in the UK to "more than just it's taste".  I trust Lucifer is heating his branding iron as we speak.
