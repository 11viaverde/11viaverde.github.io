      You know, I've watched the show and yet I failed to make the connection. For some reason the first thing that came to mind was Thomas Mann's short story "Tobias Mindernickel". Which is great, by the way, but that's neither here nor there.

      Hm, not a bad defence, but I think it's presumptuous and wrong to say thorfinn was presenting it "from [his] own perspective." It's more like he was implicitly setting up a proxy character who was clearly not himself and then using him to make the kind of statement that a typically offensive character would make for the purpose of satirizing such thinking. And I really don't think your response qualifies as a joke, since it was just direct sarcasm, but maybe that's just my biased reading.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But you're right, let's not get worked up about it. I'm just suggesting that maybe your refusal to appreciate irony in this case only serves to further inscribe you in the patriarchal Symbolic order of binary absolutes and is thus counter-productive.

      No, it's  <em>implicitly</em>  done. When you jokingly make a comment that would at face value be taken as 'offensive' or bigoted, but deliberately and obviously exaggerate it to the point that it becomes ridiculous, you are not being racist/sexist but satirizing racist/sexist beliefs by showing how ridiculous they are. I am only laying this out here in such detail in the hopes that at least one person will finally get it through their head and that at least one exchange like this can be avoided in the future.

      Oh my GOD, I just saw a thing, I just saw a thing! Thorfinn's post that I responded to was  <em>in response to</em>  something else. I was scrolled to a part of the page where there was nothing further to the left, and I assumed it was a response to the strip, and not that "Lesbians are man's greatest achievement." It was totally irony, and I thought it was just a horrible, non-ironic joke. No wonder folks got so mad at me! Holy shit! Your proxy theory is 100% valid.

      It is not true.  Cuervo can however make girls hit on guys, and then vomit on them.  I've seen it happen. One of my buddies, who was drunk on the Cuervo as well was all standing there, then this girl we both knew came up and started flirting with him, then threw up on him, then fell down onto the couch and took a nap.  It was hilarious

      I am not an english major, but way back in the day, I had a WR 095 teacher who was horribly anal about grammar (An A quality paper could get knocked down to a low B for 2-3 minor grammatical errors) that many of the rules just got burned into my brain.  I am a double science major, which means that assetbar is one of the few places where I get to type anything that isn't in the third person, passive voice, and past tense.  I'm usually all like "10 mL of 1.0M HCl was added.  A change in color from violet to orange was observed in the solution.".  I hate Gen Chem, I hate it right in the face.  It makes sense that I have to take it as a Geology/Physics major, but it bores the shit out of me.

"High upon the misty mountain fortress, thorfinn worked slavishly at his creation.  A drop of sweat rolled down the side of his handsome, square-jawed face and onto his rock-hard pectorals.  It was not just for his science that the village wenches came to him.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
With great care, he added 10mL of 1.0M HCl to the violet solution, and waited. The seconds ticked by.  Nothing.  Was it all in vain?  Would he be doomed to failure yet one more time?  Wait: the solution, it was changing, blossoming into a vicious, roiling orange.  It had worked! He had done it! <br/> 
 <br/> 
'Fools!', he cried triumphantly, 'They will mock me no more!'" <br/>

      I used to have this awful boss who was a lazy, cheap bastard and a compulsive liar.  I constantly had to cover for him, fix problems, take heat from clients, etc. etc.  His father was (allegedly) a former general in the South Vietnamese army, and all his buddies gave him scotch as a present, even though nobody in their family drank.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Long story short, once I figured all of this out I demanded bottles of scotch from him to fix his problems.  I am still waiting for the right occasion to finish the Lagavulin 25 and the last sip of the Laphroaig 30. <br/>

      If you like Jim Beam Rye, try Wild Turkey Rye.  It makes the JB taste like paint thinner.  Even better, though it's expensive and hard to find, is the Old Potrero Rye.  It is the best non-scotch whisky I've had.

      Agreed.  If you're going to use it for mixed drinks, I would go with Wild Turkey Rye for something that needed some sweetness and Sazerac (the rye, not the mixed drink made with rye) is with no doubt the best base for a Manhattan. <br/>

I think I got into rye at too advanced an age to appreciate Old Overholt.  I bet I would have loved that in high school.

      Now now, Patron Silver does have the benefit of, unlike many tequilas, being worth half what people charge you for it.  For me, Herrada is the good stuff.  Priced the same as the below-mentioned Corazon, but with a nicer set of complexities in my opinion.  Of course, I don't have much experience with tequila; gin's my bag.

      Herradura is likely going to start dropping off in quality because they've been acquired by Brown-Forman. <br/>

      Ah, a Boodles man!  We are few and we need to be more vocal.  It's just impossible to get in Maine, and the NH State stores only ever seem to have 750ml.  It isn't my favorite gin, but it might well be the most versatile gin I've ever encountered. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I get a lot of flak for this, but Tanqueray is my choice.  I was raised on it as mother's milk and something about it just exemplifies a straightforward gin for me because of the heritage.

      I'm gonna hate on Tanqueray forever for getting rid of  Malacca, but it's still a darn decent drink. I don't even think Ten is better than the standard pour, either. <br/>

I can't find Boodles damn near anywhere too, but you're right, it's just fantastic  <em>enough</em>  in just about every way, especially for the money.

      Ten is overpriced and not that great.  I bought it once and all subsequent times it came into my possession as gifts. <br/>

      It is all about the Plymouth gin.. Tanqueray is Gorden's with some taste. Yes I am from Plymouth and yes the Plymouth Gin factory gives some brilliant freebies on their tour..... So maybe I am just biased with free gin? One of my favourite radio messages sent ever was one sent to the Royal Navy in World War two saying that the Blackfriars distillery was bombed but worry not as Plymouth Gin will still be distilled!! Priorities are correct there!

      Death is. Of itself, it is neither happy nor sad. It is a door to another kind of life.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That she is dead does not sorrow me as much as the way she died. The anger and hatred expressed. The useless pain of a senseless battering. The absolute and ultimate invalidation of another human life. The drunken disregard for life itself. The lack of awareness of the perps. Do they not see that they have beaten themselves? <br/> 
 <br/> 
The existence of our Achewood fellow traveler is yet a happier one than that of her attackers.

As much as we all love to make fun of goths, we all know they are far closer to us in kind than the degenerates that would stomp on someone's head for the way they were dressed.

I'm a believer in lex talionis but I don't really feel the offenders in this case should be beaten to death.

      I'm a little surprised how much this story has been staying with me all day. I'm usually all flippant about people dying, all "Check it out, I recorded World's Worst Rickshaw Disasters, pause it there, that dude is totally getting pulled into the spokes." but this one makes me very sad. I think it's the pointless brutality of the deaths, the ignorance of killers and the fact that I have many times thought about buying that same shirt if my dang credit card wasn't always maxed.

1) Feel it appropriate to make such a request <br/>

As much as I hate to be that "the book was better" guy, I have to say that the movie has nothing on the book in terms of disturbing and graphic imagery. If the movie was rated R, one would have to invent an entirely new alphabet to give the book a rating.

      I believe you, Tek, but I think lezzing out is more common over here. I honestly don't know many girls who haven't made out with another girl before. I mean it's not like they've all shagged another girl or anything, but it seems to me that girls kissing is a much bigger deal in America.

      I've seen it a couple of times in London but many more times in Cape Town. The girls I saw in London were probably South African. It seems that girls of slightly less than average attractiveness find that kissing each other generates a lot of male attention, giving them an edge they were lacking. I wonder if they realise they are attracting the worst kind of men...

      Oh well, obviously for most it's an attention thing, and they don't care that they're attracting the worst kind of men. All that they care about is that they're attracting men, who will give them validaition of their own attractiveness, even though it's so meaningless. <br/>

      I don't see Gogol Bordello as a gimmick band at all. I mean, if Eugene Hütz is going to be in a band, he is going to be a Urkranian in a band. Should he be trying to make the music sound as Western and expected as possible just so that nobody will think it's a gimmick? Why is it gimmicky for him to make music that draws on the styles that influenced him and the things he cares about? That's what bands usually do -- the only difference is that a lot of his influences don't come from here because  <em>he's not from here.</em>

      You make a thoughtful point. But what I mean is that without the accordion, the violin and the jazzy costumes, they'd be just another mediocre punk band, which, if you substitute "jazzy costumes" for "a ridiculously overstressed Irish accent," would also pretty well explain Flogging Molly (though I'll allow that Gogol Bordello are  <em>much</em>  better than Flogging Molly).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Employing these kinds of tricks isn't necessarily damning. I love Devo, and they were about as gimmicky as it gets. But underneath the pseudophilosophy and funny hats were songs that would've been just as great without all that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess in the end it has more to do with the fact that I find Gogol Bordello's music to be thoroughly uninteresting without all the "gypsy" trappings, and because of this I consider them to be kind of a joke band. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We disagree.

      I just don't think it's fair to dismiss one of the main elements of their style as "'gypsy' trappings." If incorporating the traditions of that kind of music was something that bands normally did, you wouldn't consider it something gimmicky. What they're trying to do is introduce the styles of "gypsy music" into Western culture. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, if you turned it around -- say we usually listened to music that was all about accordion and violin. We had vague ideas that in other places they did weird things with guitars and stuff, but mostly paid that no mind and stereotyped it heavily. And then band comes along, and they want to show us the rock music that we've been ignoring, but they think that what we're doing with the accordions is good, too. So they play music that uses accordions and violins and everything the way we're used to, but also uses things like electric guitars. Would you say, "Yeah, but without all the 'rock and roll' trappings, they're just another boring band"?

      If their aim is to introduce the styles of gypsy music to Western youth, I applaud them. I hope it works. <br/>

But I don't like the cut of their jib. I will check out some tradtional Ukrainian folk CDs from the library. That's how I'll learn.

      What Achilleselbow says is true. The character played by the singer from Gogol Bordello actually manages to steal the show to an even greater extent in the book (in spite of lacking the magnetic appeal of Eugene Hütz), in which he is one of the most entirely wonderful characters I have ever read about.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
At one point he confesses that he has not, in fact, ever had sex with a woman (and has no desire to ever do so, for that matter, but that is less directly conveyed), but that he has been saying so because it makes him feel like a "premium person," and because he does not want his father to kill him or his brother to hate him.

      SCENE: THE ANTARCTIC ICE SHEETS <br/> 
 <br/> 
AL GORE is standing in the snow, looking through binoculars. He is watching a large piece of the Antarctic ice sheet collapse into the sea and float away. This is visibly upsetting to him, as upsetting as it would be for you or I to watch as our children's hopes and dreams are slowly crushed before their eyes and turned into the mulch of despair to grow the gladiolas of apathy. He puts down his binoculars and speaks to the camera. <br/> 
 <br/> 
GORE: Climate change is affecting us all. The world is changing, and it could have desperate consequences for our standards of living, our economy, and our future. But it doesn't need to be like this. There is another way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
CUT to a montage of MIKE GRAVEL angrying up the Democratic primary debates. He is a man filled with ire and volatility. He is not just a new bicycle. He is the future. <br/> 
 <br/> 
GORE: "Mike Gravel is an angry man. His rage can be seen from space. It has been shown that when Mike Gravel gets angry, he wastes enough heat and light to power Minnesota. This anger appears limitless, completely without end, unable to be used up. It is an energy source going to waste." <br/> 
 <br/> 
CUT to Mike Gravel sitting on a chair. He is attached to a large, whirring machine, and is watching MTV. He is visibly distressed by this experience. If he were David Banner, he would have Hulked out approximately 65 minutes ago. <br/> 
 <br/> 
GORE: "But this clean, dependable energy can be harnessed. Attaching Mike Gravel to a turbine and letting him watch what the damn fool goddamn kids have done to this fine country, we can provide at least part of a solution to this country's search for renewable energy resources. And if we work together, we can use other angry men to power our schools, our hospitals, our workplaces and our homes in a completely sustainable way." <br/> 
 <br/> 
CUT to a larger plant full of old men shouting at televisions. Some of them are waving sticks. Some are holding their fists together so hard they are creating small diamonds from the distressed carbon that was once their hands. These are angry men. <br/> 
 <br/> 
GORE: Rage power. They're mad as hell, and we're going to take it for longer. <br/>

      The only way for it to make sense for Ramses to be in an arc about Roast Beef's wedding is if he is in the arc in a way that does not make sense for him to be in the wedding. Like if he were an usher or the reverend or something. But I don't think Onstad does that type of comedy where he violently changes your expectations of a character. That would be like writing his own comedy fanfiction.

In his later years, the pony-tail will turn into a combination pony-tail comb over, and he will have permanent sweat-stains, and small black curly hairs growing through his wife beater. He will not have a wife to beat. He will make jokes about the name of his wife-beater. He will joke that he beats others' wives. He will live neat a college campus, and buy booze for undergrads.

      Off topic, I know, but let it be known that today my kind-of friend was in the city-wide spelling bee for NYC, and she got 14th place.  <br/> 
What did she misspell, you ask? <br/> 
 <h15>CACAO.</h15> <br/> 
I am mad because: <br/> 
a) I could have probably won, but was disqualified for being absent on the day of the schoolwide bee <br/> 
b) I know she could have done better, but she was just so flustered up there, and her hearing disabilty made her embarrased to ask for many repetitions, so she just turned red and spelled c-a-c-a-u. <br/> 
c) The lady pronouncing the words was the least enunciatey lady I had ever seen. What the flying chicken is she doing sounding out words at a spelling bee? I've only ever heard the word "Hedonism" pronounced "HEE-don-ism", but she pronounced is "HEAD-on-ism", so sould we be surprised when that's how it was spelled? I don't know if that's some obscure pronounciation or what, but it still pisses me off a bit. <br/> <br/> <br/> And that was Catgrl ranting about a spelling bee.

      Misspelling "dumber" ( <em>twice</em> ) isn't exactly a "simple mistake."  <br/>

      He misspelled a simple word twice, while calling someone an idiot for not pronouncing another word properly.  When correcting others' grammar/syntax/spelling/diction, it is imperative that you not make such mistakes yourself.  This is a clear case of the pot calling the kettle an idiot.

      He didn't make it up. I've known and used that unlikely disease's name since, like fifth grade. (You weren't born yet.) But it is a bit of scam. The word was created and included in the Oxford Complete Dictionary of the English Language ONLY to be the longest word in this multi-volumed dictionary. It had no previous existence that can be cited. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The longest word in the English language that actually IS a word is "floccinaucinihilipilification" (I hope I spelled it correctly for you), which means to do a bad job at creating an estimate of value on something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Below, you note the existence of a painfully long Mori name from New Zealand. This is considered the longest place name in English. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I recall reading an article like thirty years ago of a place name in Finland consisting of 110 letters. Finnish, being an aglomorative language, basically just adds prefixes and suffixes to words instead of adjectives and adverbs. (Kinda' like Antidisestablishmentarianism and Non-Antidisestablishmentarianism.) I find no mention of this Finnish town on the Internet today, so it's possible they've since renamed it something easier to put on street signs, like "L". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am told that in Polish you can describe a person as being 999,999,999.5 years old with this tongue twister word: "dziewiecsetdziewiecdziesieciodziewieciomilionowodziewiecsetdziewiecdziesieciodziewieciotysiecznodziewiecsetdziewiecsetdziewiecdziesieciodziewiecioipolletniemu" That's 166 letters by my count! Honestly, I find it hard to imagine a practical use for the word. <br/>

Anyway, there's my two-ton bits on the subject.

      Cpnglxynchos pulled into the Taco Bell lot. It was far too late to be getting food at this hour, but he knew that. Some things you just can't help. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He had been watching Murphy Brown reruns when the craving hit him. Hard and fast, like a rabid raccoon on a kid who had been playing in garbage, it came out of nowhere, and once it latched on, it would not let go. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I wonder if it's still open," Cpnglxynchos thought to himself. "The drive-thru must be, at least. What is it they say in the commercials... open great... even late?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was no use. He could not remember. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To Cpnglxynchos's surprise, the lights inside were on. A lone, grizzled employee was wiping down the tables. Cpnglxynchos considered the situtation. He could have still gone to the drive-thru, but at this hour, it might be quicker to just go inside. "Besides," he remembered, "they never give me enough goddamn napkins." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The door creaked as he opened it. The employee paid him no heed. He cleared his throat, but to no avail. He could sense that something wasn't right, but he pushed the thought away. The craving had to be satisfied. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Excuse me," he barely managed to squeeze out, his voice cracking in the process. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Yes?" The voice seemed almost to come from somewhere else as the employee continued about his business without turning his head. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Can... can I get a Supreme Gordita?" Cpnglxynchos asked, the words barely tumbling out of his mouth like potato chips from a poorly opened bag.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Slowly the employee's head turned, so slowly in fact that it was several seconds before Cpnglxynchos could notice the scar over his left eye. By then, it was too late. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He smiled broadly. "One Supreme Gordita, comin' right up."

      the project is too awesome for my computer to export into a gif. laaaaaaaame. i guess i will just have to type it out here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i was returning home after picking my mother up from the airport when we decided we wanted to eat in a Taco Bell. we traveled to one and tried to open the doors. the sign said '10AM to Midnite' but the doors were locked. THE DOORS WERE LOCKED. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"whatev," we said. (we did not say 'whatev.') "no big deal. we'll just go through the drive thru and tell them about their lockedness." i made mention of it and the man quickly responded that they close their doors at ten but the  <em>drive-thru</em>  was open until midnight. i pointed out that the sign said 'lobby' but they insisted it was the drive-thru. i sighed and resigned, saying it wasn't as important as my immense hunger was. i ordered for us and paid and continued down the lane until it came to our attention that one important part was missing from our order; the 'food' part of my Crunchy Beefy Melt combo. cue a quick-turn back into the lane and explain what my issue was. the first guy on the speaker had no idea what to say to me and asked when i'd ordered (when my order was not more than three orders old) but the acting manager told me to drive on ahead to the first window and we'd figure it out. i went to the first window and laid out my case to a man who  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">did not understand me</span> . he did not speak  <em>any</em>  English. NONE. he mumbled something in spanish right before said manager came up behind him to take care of The Case Of The Missing Food Items, telling me to move ahead to the second window. he half-took care of the situation and as i drove away the second time, not only did i feel raped by a group of men, i am sure they took several dumps in my family's tacos. (which i promptly deposited in the trashcan as soon as we arrived at home.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
this is not as fascinating as achilleselbow's story in any stretch but 100% true.

      Showbiz is ded on in this one. The perfect verbiage. "Lez out". Nobody says that anymore. But he does. And his complete lack of regard to the wedding is perfectly in character.

      I kind of agree with your sentiment, but the guy was pretty vocal about the birth of his child in the strip, she has been a topic and even "pictured" in the strip, and for fuck's sake he is selling a book that chronicles her early days.  It's not exactly like he's kept her a secret.   <br/>

Don't be so surpised if someone posts "happy b-day little O."  (I'm not fanatical enough to remember what Onstad's daughter's name is, let alone her birthday.)
