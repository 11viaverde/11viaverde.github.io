      I would give you another chubby if I could sir. I say fie, fie to the nay sayers. While the guest comics aren't always as good as Onstad's, some of them are awesome in their own right. The people who whine about it have to much time on their hands, and are likely troglodytes living in their parent's basement. Some of them are likely to have never been laid.

      Actually, Phillipe reads like half the characters in Scary Go Round.  I do like Allison's comics, though.  Maybe he should try Nice Pete sometime.

      This was up for like a week when I started reading Achewood. I read the whole archives in two days and this  was the last one. I guess what I am trying to say is I have nostalgia for this one, even if it is a guest strip.

      I was personally put off by "...for me, Philippe." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, since he was the only character, I was ready to assume that he was talking.  But when that came up, I thought someone else was talking to  <em>him</em> . <br/>

Guest strip, eh.  But at least it looks cute.
