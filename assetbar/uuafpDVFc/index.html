      Is this different from how he is normally?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cat got in a car accident and got out of it with tens of millions of dollars for himself and his bear friend,  <em>and</em>  a prescription for weeks worth of drunkenness for health purposes.  <br/>

Sounds like classic Ray to me.

      It probably doesn't help that at least one of the following is true: <br/> 
 <br/> 
(1) Ray's doctor thinks he is a lawyer <br/> 
 <br/> 
(2) Ray's lawyer likes to dress up as a doctor

      I, for one, am curious what will happen as a result of Teodor getting his share of that money. On one hand he will no longer need to find last-minute solutions to make money for rent, but on the other he might use it to launch some sort of venture or otherwise cause it to greatly change his lifestyle.

      I am of the opinion that not even winning big in the out of court lottery is enough to change Teodor's life. He'll either lose the money quickly, or let it sit in the bank for years as he keeps coming up with new ideas and new restaurant plans and new menu quirks while never following through on any of them.

*swirl, sniff, sip, swoosh*  <br/>

This has a particularly unappealing body that it tries nonchalantly to hide, and no legs to speak of. The aroma is fraught with inconsistencies; bold and ambition with little to no drive, full of dreams yet unwilling to work for them, like the smell of the high school hallways on a dreary Saturday morning when you're going to take your SATs for the fourth time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The finish is bitter and premature, technically suicide because seriously what overweight 39 year old man decides to up and run a 5k after a decade of freelance (read: I don't even have to walk from my car) web design in  <em>April</em> ? You had to convulse and die in front of those children at the Spring Fun Run instead of in your house with some measure of dignity. <br/>

      I briefly thought of that (also as making Ray richer is basically a way of giving out the money, but having it make no impact), but T was also imperiled by their actions, regardless of who the owner is. IANAL, but I would suspect that he could easily sue them as well.

      Maybe Ray will not settle out of court. I mean, Teodor seems pretty angry about the OnStar circumstances. Maybe he will convince Ray to take this baby to court so that he could zip around on a Roomba, yelling to people that they can't HANDLE the truth about what happened in the Escalade.

      The flaw in that storyline would have been that there is no sight in Heaven or on Earth more compelling, enticing, or heartbreaking than that of the woman you love asleep in the dark, with her back turned to you. No one would have credited it, you see.

      I seem to be in the minority that finds absolutely nothing enticing about a woman asleep with her back to you. I just worry that I'm going to wake her up and get bitched at. <br/>

      I'm with you, Bel-baby. That sight is enticing only to those who A) Are not in a relationship, or B) Have been in a relationship for only a very short while. Sleep next to the same person every night for a few years and, love them as you may, the poetic reveries tend to dry up a bit. This is not depressing.

Tell me, friend, how long has your current relationship being going on? If your answer to this question is "More than three years," then we are simply different sorts of men who can agree to disagree and go our separate ways. If your answer is "Less than three years," then you are a blindly romantic idealist, which is terribly sweet. Not terribly realistic, but terribly sweet.

      That part still confuses me. I mean, I thought the panel of that in the last strip was a flash for the reader, not something that Beef knew anything about. I see no way that he could have known. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, who was in the theater? Onstad spends a couple of panels leading up to the hastening, titles a strip after the man in seat Z-1, but then none of that directly leads to anything. Yeah, yeah, mood, but Beef solves the problem on his own and that's the end of it basically.

      Maybe the story isn't done and the man in seat Z-1 is the dying man?  This really seems like the end of the arch to me, but I guess it's conceivable that it's not and that the shadowy figure could come back into play for a more satisfactory (and comprehensive) conclusion.

      I'm pretty certain that the person(s) who identified the man in seat Z-1 as Beef himself (his inner self, as recognized/displayed by the Mexican realist camera) was right on. Beef was judging himself, a spectator in the theater observing his own reaction to death coming for him.  He deserted his own death; he himself was the dying man he deserted. Simple and neat.

Looking at these plans you probably have the one that charges $1 per extra GB, which isn't too bad when compared to the plan that charges $20 per extra GB. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Here in the US the only plans that approach these kind of limits are mobile data plans that operate over the cell phone network. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, it's nice at least that in your country they are up front about the limits.  Here in the US the internet companies don't tell you what the limits are, but if you hit the limit, the cancel your account, sometimes without notice, or if they do give you notice to cut back on your usage, they still refuse to tell you what the limits are...   <br/>

I hope you don't have any flatmates who are complete idiots.  There is always one of those it seems, who won't empty out the trash when it's full, who leaves dirty dishes lying around, who leaves an active web page with streaming advertising content open when he's not even using the computer...

      what you need is a router that can record the bandwidth usage of each ethernet port, then you could know who is using how much bandwidth... hook up a unique wireless access point to each port for each flatmate who wants wireless... and if it could throttle the bandwidth of each port that would be nice too... you could throttle down the bandwidth of the offending flatmate before he uses all the bandwidth.  I don't know what's out there in the way of turn key router solutions like that.. I haven't messed with 'em ever.

      It's not automatically "bad" to limit bandwidth.  Bandwidth costs money.  It takes resources to maintain bandwidth.  If we give everyone unlimited bandwidth at a flat fixed rate, then everyone will waste bandwidth and a few people will waste a disproportionate amount of bandwidth.  Somehow or other this bandwidth has to be paid for by society.  Building bandwidth just so that it can be wasted is similar to community churches building huge church buildings that sit mostly empty much of the time while meanwhile we have homeless people...   I mean...  couldn't the church paritioners just telecommute for Gods sakes?  Via web cam?  Oh wait that would waste bandwidth...  Well to put it another way, it would be like North Korea building a huge multi-lane highway (which they did do) while they don't actually have very many cars, to put it mildly...  You don't want North Korea style communism, do you?  Because it sure sounds like you do... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Obviously one could say that it is incumbent upon the ISP, as a constructive contributing member of society, to try to use a bandwidth sharing system which makes for the most efficient use of bandwidth and the most fair sharing of bandwidth cost by society.  If you have any better ideas for how wazza should do this, let's hear them...

      I like how roast beef has died so many times now that "Man, what a day that was" type replaying in his mind doesn't really happen anymore... Don't think it really did in the first place.   <br/>

Also notice that Roast Beef's thoughts echo the note that Ray received from CH after his encounter.  Damn you cartilage head... damn you. <br/>

      Exactly. But, if that is the case, then why was Beef chosen? Is the lash real? Did CH nullify the lash's effects even as he drugged Beef and tested him? If the lash was not real then why was Beef selected to be the focus of this elaborate ruse?

      OK, here's a scenario: what was added to the vinegar-and-paper solution was the bark of the tree which cancels the Lash. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Beef is then presented with a choice between cancelling the Lash and accepting its consequences. Luckily for us, and Molly, he chose to cancel the lash, deserting the "dying man" who had been Hastened.

      He lets Beef live in the pool house. He is clearly aware of his friends having needs, but perhaps it just never occurred to him that Teodor might need a little help every now and then. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray is also a man very much in need of amusement. Give him the need for money in the form of a plan for a shaky business venture and you'll have the money if he either finds it interesting or thinks it might actually go somewhere, but just cash handouts? Not really the dude's style. There's a big difference between always picking up the check and paying your rent. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you have ever had a wealthy friend (even if it just means you're in college and the dude's parents gave him a credit card for expenses) then you will easily recognize how Ray is perfectly characterized in this respect.

      my experience has been that giving away money or material items or potentially useful information (e.g. advice) almost never helps anyone.  Often when people are in need of money, it's because of some fundamental direction in which their overall life is headed as a cumulative result of all of the ways in which that person interacts with the world.  Give someone money and they may well need money again tomorrow.  Give someone more money than the average person spends in 100 lifetimes and that person may well spend it none the less in a fraction of a lifetime.  Even assuming that the lucky recipient of money stays away from excessive drugs, sex, and rock 'n roll, he or she may well have a tough time adjusting to such a radically different environment, and may ultimately have some kinda serious psychological issues as a result.

      As far as I can tell, Teodor pays rent to Onstad anyway (or, living in the Onstad house, helps with the rent).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In either case, Onstad makes money from Teodor by portraying his antics in a monetised web-comic, so charging rent seems a bit rough in the first place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, it's been suggested that Teodor, being a stuffed animal, is more or less a chattel of Onstad's. Since he can be forced to work at 5am wearing clothes made out of garbage, mayhap Chris is going to claim the lion's share of Teodor's out-of-court settlement. The bastard. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again, since the Onstad family moved, perhaps they've left the Achewood house to the animals. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So many questions.

      I think he already  <em>was</em>  dead (from the performance in the theater).  He only escaped the ride through the Karmic fun factory. <br/>

Also, his admission about deserting a dying man is ambiguous.  He could be talking about himself, or he could be talking about Ray and T.  When he exited his Final Exit, he deserted his de-cat-inated carcass, as well as his friends in the cremation-'Sclade.

      It is my firm belief that Beef did not abandon Ray and T. For one, I do not think that Beef even knew of their predicament. Second, Beef would not abandon them, had he a chance to save them. He may not stand up for himself but he most certainly stands up for his friends. <br/>

I will grant, however, that to say that one would abandon a dying man, when said man is oneself, is a rather peculiar way of putting things. Regardless, I have resigned to reading the line this way for the reasons stated above.

      I like the fortifications. Seems to me like they should press the left flank a bit harder (the one that does not have the bastions) while continuing entrenching and undermining on the right flank. The trenches they have are a good starting point, but they'll still get hammered there unless they can either bring up some heavier guns (unlikely; the ground is probably soft) or get some sappers under that bastion. <br/>

      Beyond theory, I know have experience, and I can tell you that what passes for wisdom when you're young doesn't stand the test of time.  I think the implications of what we believe can't be seen clearly.  There are unforeseen twists, surprising betrayals, failures of will, broken promises, and our own self-image problems that fuck everything up.  So your reboot, retool, retrench, and speaking of trenches, get out of ruts you carve dragging your ignorance around.  On the plus side, life is can also be full of revelations and insights.  Life is for learning, and true wisdom usually comes late.

      so... did roast beef bail on ray and teodor/somehow know about their predicament remotely? and did anyone else think from the last strip that beef saw molly in bed through the exit door, remembered r and t, and then left molly because he knew he had to take care of his friends (somehow)?

      I also believed this to be the case. The background in Molly and Beef's room is black, while the outside world is grey... Beef appeared to be shutting the door on black, and remanining in grey. However, I suppose it is all night time and shady and ambiguous.

      I believe that was just a cutaway to the burning vehicle in order to leave the readers wondering whether Beef went to Molly or his death, and also to remind them that Ray and Teodor were still in mortal danger. <br/>

      A local burger establishment charges a bit more than $5 (I think it might be $5.50 or 5.75 or so) for their shakes. This immediately struck me as a deep sense of something wrong with the world. <br/>

      Agree.  Fresh bark of what?  He could have wrapped it up better, and what I don't like is the feeling that he was winging it, and never had the arc scripted out. <br/>

What I dislike the most is Beef (apparently) taking the morally wrong choice, even if we don't understand it.  But then everyone loves Beef so much, maybe Onstad wanted to humanize him.  Either way, such interesting details deserve a better ending than a 'cop-out.'  I agree <br/>

      I likewise gave up on Goats at some point that I can barely recognize. Apparently it changed into some sort of a weird sci-fi comic or something after 2001 or so. <br/>

I think not reading Scary-Go-Round for over a year or so makes us officially broken up, but I still don't want to acknowledge that that might be the case. I still pine for Bobbins.

      I've got nothing against it or, for that matter, Goats. I just forgot to read it at some point and that point became a week and then when I finally did catch up I let the same thing happen again until it was just too much to catch up on and I haven't been able to get it together enough to catch up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hopefully it'll happen one day with Goats, but at this point I've missed more than when I first started reading it before the turn of the millennium.

      well it's not entirely clear that Beef didn't go back to the Karma machine and get reincarnated as himself and then rejoin Molly in bed, but we can suppose that if this had happened, we would have seen the Karma machine and it's gears again. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It does seem that Beef walked through the Exit portal into the bedroom. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It looks like the panel of the Escalade in flames was a maladroit effort by Onstad to change the scene to show the action over there...  It would seem that the reason Onstad didn't put it where it should have been - as the last panel - is that he wanted the dramatic closing of the door to be the last panel.  At the very least, the flaming Escalade should have been annotated with "meanwhile..." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The dying man that Beef deserted is either a reference to Molly, himself, or to CH.  In the case of Molly, it would be a gender neutral reference.  If beef is referencing Molly, well, at least he un-abandoned her.  It could be referencing Beef, since he did abandon his whole Karma death thing.  It could be referencing CH, in so far as the Karma machine was a big CH performance art project and CH somehow needed Beef to complete the performance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again, why the need to know exactly what the artist's intent was?  There is certainly a lot of creativity here, a lot of fodder for imagination, and why the fuck not tell yourself your own story.  It is to be hoped that someone can propose a more interesting story than one own self can imagine, but some of the proposals kinda suck and bring me down.  I propose that no one should propose any theories as to what's happening in the strip unless those theories are fantastic and don't suck.

      In the earlier strips, Beef talked about his death as a favor to others ("she'll be rid of me and i'll be rid of me"), and thus generally a good thing. Although WE know that Molly would rather have him alive, he refuses to believe this. Hence, "Sorry Molly, I was a coward who would desert a dyin' man". He feels it was cowardly to ditch his own death, since she supposedly would have been happier without him.

      All right, I hate to say it, but this thought had occured, and now seems confirmed: <br/>

Perhaps 'Achewood Volume 2: Worst Song, Played On Ugliest Guitar' was delayed because they wanted to shoehorn in this story arc.  But some kind of publishing pressure got applied and Onstar (Onstad) had to wrap it up in an unsatisfactory quick and dirty.  Just got notified, my pre-order got shipped yesterday.

      Well the comics are from no later than May 2002, so it is not.  I pre-ordered in May when it was available for order on Amazon and they kept delaying it.  If I had checked Dark Horse (Which I did much later) I would've (and did) see it was slated for release September anyway.  So now I have it.  The end!  No moral.

      Someone obviously has little exposure to the world of comics so I'll break it down. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Work is  <em>solicited</em>  two months in advance, typically by appearing for order in "Previews" the $5 catalog put out by Diamond, the monopolistic overlord and basically only distributor in the entire industry. This'll get you a cover shot (maybe), a bit of text, and an ordering code. Ostensibly this is for retailers, but in reality just about everyone pre-orders everything they buy and just show up to pick it up. So unless you do it online or something and depending on how your retailer handles it (most do pull lists where they automatically order and hold what you want, but some require you to individually order every issue, possibly using the ordering code) there's a chance you actually have to buy a fucking catalog every month to order stuff.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyhow, as I said, solicits are typically two months in advance, but often work comes out late for a number of reasons. In most other industries this would be seen as sloppy and unprofessional, but in comics it's quite common to have major titles come out erratically because the writer or artist isn't getting things done on deadline. Seeing something get pushed back a month or so is pretty normal (rare is the book that comes out on time every month for a year) and sometimes you'll see books that are solicited and then fail to appear for years at a time (Warren Ellis is particularly guilty of this with such things as issue three of Ministry of Space coming out three years late) or series that are never exactly canceled, but never quite manage to actually see new issues released. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the second volume of the hardcover Powers collection was solicited well over a year or more before it actually managed to be released. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically Onstad is in good company and expecting anything to come out from a comic publisher on time is folly.

The dragonfly killed itself I think.  It's buzzing periodically but he kept slamming into lights so he might've burned himself to death.  In any case I'm armed with a broom, a can of Febreeze and paper towels if he resurrects.

      Damn. I wasn't trying to be condescending really. I mean, maybe a little bit of mock-condescension at the beginning, but that's it. We're all friends here and, well, I never miss an opportunity to go on about how the comics industry is run like a couple of kids in their garage. I never know how much people know about this sort of thing so I try to explain the whole process in all it's fucked-up glory. <br/>

      I know they're basically harmless; anyone that's played baseball for at least a few years (especially outfielders) can attest to this.  Dry spells in the game lead to lazy observations of numerous dragonflies' flights hither and yon.

      Well NOW's comment hurt my brain.  Caused brain pain.  I was wondering to myself: what the hell is he saying?  Is this some subtle reference that I'm not getting?  Is he making fun of me?  Is everyone on assetbar going to be laughing at me when they read this comment of his?  Is he just confused?  Did he mean to put a hyperlink in there but somehow screwed it up?  How could you screw up a hyperlink so badly that it doesn't show up  <em>at all?</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Reading his comment was like having a confusing trip on acid... Not a bad bad trip, but more of a paranoid and confused trip where you simply don't know what's going on anymore at all, but unfortunately, you're still cogent enough to somehow be aware of how confused you are.  So I reacted snipilly.

      Not anything other than I was at an impressionable age and I lived within sight of the towers and I had many cop relatives who went down there everyday for months afterwards and knew people who worked there (though no one I knew was hurt, thank God) and basically physically and mentally was closer to it than a lot of people, and even though it was definitely an attack on America, it was huge for the actual city of New York and that was painfully evident for weeks and months and even years afterwards.

      the tv in my parents' room was tuned to some news channel and i asked my mom what was going on and she said that some plane'd crashed into the wtc. then i saw the second one go in live and i knew it was not an accident. i gasped that and my mom thought i was mistaken and just watching a replay. then she realized there wasn't really any replay of the first one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
a lot changed that day... <br/> 
us, them, everyone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
still got madd respect for firefighters and cops. they do a job i could never do. *fist raise*

      I had just been laid off  week earlier, so I was asleep; my husband called and said I should turn on the TV but couldn't say why.  I did, and a minute later the second plane hit.  In my just-awakened state it felt surreal, a dream; that did not change as the day wore on. It was my best friend's 30th birthday that day and we spent the evening in front of the TV instead of celebrating, watching the replays and discourse and newly unfolding events in a daze.  My sister donated blood that day to be able to give something to the world.  She can't now because of having had leukemia, so I do so for her.

      one of my mom's friends was in  <em>Vegas</em>  that day. this friend and her husband hopped on the last flight that was allowed to leave, and everyone on it was stone. silent. just all quietly dealing with their thoughts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
then someone yelled,  <strong><span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted"><em>"HEY, WHERE'S THE BUFFET?"</em></span></strong> <br/> 
and everyone laughed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
another similar story from my uncle: <br/> 
he was a technical guy, always on the forefront of military technology, and the air force sent him to Turkey to get their communications up to code. so at the base he was stationed at, there wasn't much else to do but drink. and fight. afterwards, or during. so one day at the bar, this group of guys had made a huge pyramid of beer cans. just massive. stack had to be eight feet tall. this other dude who'd had a wee bit too much stumbled and  <em>crashed into the thing, toppling it all over.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
silence. <br/> 
 <br/> 
that record needle  <strong>ZWOOP</strong> ? it happened. <br/> 
 <br/> 
glaring. <br/> 
 <br/> 
then some other guy yelled something unc couldn't remember (i wonder why~) and folk laughed and music and conversation carried on as it did five seconds before. <br/> 
 <br/> 
the end! <br/> 
a moral: well-placed words can save lives.

      I was working in my woodshop 25 miles away, the day the Murrah building was blown up. I heard the double-thump, and the radio turned from classic rock to confusion and emergency, to a national tragedy. <br/> 
I knew people who were injured there. There were babies in a daycare slaughtered by that Right-wing hatemonger. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But there was no comparison to the feeling of numbed horror watching that 2nd plane fly into the tower and knowing people with such concentrated hatred had done such a thing. And then the two buildings shuddering, and just collapsing from the sheer hatred of the deed. <br/> <br/> <br/> The thing was, the horror of the event was so profound, it stopped America's business in its tracks, and we all became human, we became neighbors for a few days. That was the transcendent gift of that grief.  <br/> 
There was absolutely no advertising, no mass manipulation to buy shit, nothing like that existed in the land for 3 days. It was awesome and beautiful, sad and majestic.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Those terrorists saw the towers as the Towers of Babel, like the fists of Mammon, the actualized expression of American Materialism. And unfortunately, there's something to that; it wasn't totally delusional. They kept trying to blow it up. <br/> <br/> <br/> I have a friend in Boston who had a friend who was one of the security checkers in the airport. My friend related this a month or so after the event. It turns out her friend did security on that first flight, # 7 was it?- and noticed a group of well-dressed Arabs keeping to themselves among the passengers. It fit the security alarm profile, and she starts to pull them aside for questioning. <br/> 
 This is a true story. <br/> 
 She looks up and her supervisor across the room makes an impatient gesture to pass them on through, because he doesn't want a delay in the flight. (It costs money) <br/> 
So, she waves them on through, and the rest was, as they say, history.  <br/> 
This woman was deeply depressed at that time, as anyone would be.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
People think they got shitty lives? They're depressed?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
My friend never said what happened to her.

In other news, it would be cool if Onstad would sell advance notice of exactly when each new strip is going to post.  It could be like... 45 minutes advance notice...  That'd be worth $5.  But only if he only sells the information to one person.  It would go to the highest bidder.  not only does he tell you when it posts, but he lets you see a preview of it a full 60 seconds before it actually posts.  That way you have time to come up with a killer first post.
