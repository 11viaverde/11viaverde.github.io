      Please do not believe this to be false.  On a recent trip to malaysia, I could not think of what to procure for my new girlfriend, whom I completely plan to become engaged to.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the China Sea, as I was sailing around in a small 2 person Catamaran, I noticed something on one of the small islands.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
We dug in on the beach and I retrieved it, and placed it into the sleeve of the catamaran's meshing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was a piece of driftwood, shaped somewhat like a very large arrow head.  I wrote "The Cure" upon it, and snuck it through customs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It now adorns the ledge above our bath. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This story is entirely true and I have no problem taking pictures if anyone disbelieves me.

      And now the Chuck Norris jokes have been superseded by Jack Bauer jokes. This has been going on for years, attaching itself to popular Tough Guys of the era. In fact, I believe the first recorded joke was "The chief export of Beowulf is pain".

      Cornelius uses the Nevada lizardman scenario to shield himself from the far more likely horror of becoming a permanent denizen of science fiction conventions, walking down an endless concrete floor in a shirtless Wedge Antilles costume, ignoring the cringes and eye-rolling from even the most hardened geek spectators.

      There was this one time where I got dragged to a performance art-thing. They had an "alternative" choir there, which consisted of two guys who looked like anemia meets a pamphlet for a bi-curious city legislature, and these two girls who had allowed cocaine to devour every fat cell in their bodies. Anyways, they started their "performance," and one guy and one girl muttering to themselves (I think the guy was reading from a newspaper?) while the other two wailed and sobbed hysterically. Like, balls-out, cancer-bereaved tears. This was their song. They were a crying machine. <br/>

I think that if you made a CD of this, it's likely that Nice Pete would purchase it in order to soothe him to sleep at night.  <br/>

      For some reason, at some point Massachusetts decided it'd be an excellent idea to have what seems to be a retarded sculptor (or several) craft balls of clay, and then they built them twenty feet tall in bronze and placed them outside of institutions, like UMass and a few museums. <br/>

However, the artists who have works that are... "visually appealing" tend to get brushed away.

      Man that is an item of truth that the cats were not introduced to the comic until very late but in a comic such as Achewood with an ensemble cast in can be very hard to determine who the main character of the comic is. In my own personal opinion of humility I always thought of Teodor as the main character just because of his somewhat easygoing straight-man comedy B-type personality which is a commonality of many comics and other such works of literature. I was somewhat surprised to see the Achewood Wikipedia article calling Ray the main character of the strip because to me that is like calling Uncle Duke the main character of  <em>Doonesbury</em>  or calling Snoopy the main character of  <em>Peanuts</em>  they each had periods where they were prominently featured in their respective comic strips but the main characters they are not But hey that is simply a testament to the malleable-ass nature of serial comics as a medium of cultural expression of the arts Don't hate it till you bake it straight up and down...

      I think Teodor was the closest thing to a main character at first, for the reasons you describe, but  he's long since been supplanted by Ray and Roast Beef. I'd still call it an ensemble cast, but those two definitely dominate in terms of 'screen' time and character depth.

      My emotions this morning are bittersweet: <br/> 
As of this morning, I have finally finished reading through the entire Achewood archive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Consider me yet another victim of Mr. Onstad's proselytization. I have steeped myself in this brave world of the desperately amusing and avant-surreal, and I am richer for having done so. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just to get it out of the way: I'm not sure of the first strip I read. I just remember my bafflement, and the realization that I needed a broader base of Achewood knowledge to truly understand. So, I went back, witnessed Phillipe standing on it, and the rest is a history of near-Biblical proportions.

      I too have just read through the archive lost_buoy, not my first time but first in assestbar. I don't have a clue of the first achewood strip either, (closed the tab quickly, kind of a visceral reaction to seeing a cat in a thong for the first time) although if someone put a gun to my head I  <em>think</em>  the first strip I ever read was  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145422/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/one_strip?b=M%5ea11f09b8576e606bcb5038dfdb92fb821&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fachewood.com%2Fcomic.php%3Fdate%3D04162003/">this one</a> .

      Ondstadt is slowly breaking down the mythos. This is all part of his plan to keep everyone on their toes. Even if the other characters don't find out about the fact that Cornelius was shamed by a fake tattoo, there still exists the fact that he's spent the last two strips sniffling. Lame me if you want, but perhaps a real Badass would have simply called Dr. Andretti and slipped out under cover of darkness.

      I think the central agreement here is clear: whether he were to retain a certain level of bespoke class or if he embraced the total chaos the tattoo produces, a true Badass does not sit on the floor crying and hitting himself with a shoe. He gets up, and He acts like a Man about this.

      I love how they believe in Cornelius's badassness enough that they would rather believe he had invented a crying machine instead of actually weeping.  <br/>

Now he realizes he must live on, as testament to the faith they have in his asskickery.  <br/>

      That's what i thought at first, but i think they are just tired from the long night of drinking. The high eyes are usually the tired lines and the / \ eyebrows, which Ray is showing here (maybe he's high  <em>and</em>  tired) but the other two aren't. Also , the time  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145422/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=06262003">beef got high</a>  he freaked out and was pretty wide-eyed the whole time.

      I'm surprised no one has brought this up yet, but it's possible that Ray is simply being extremely tactful. It's a long shot and certainly "crying machine" fits with Ray's silliness, he also seems to have demonstrated the capacity for just this sort of intuition on a few other occasions.

      well, i think we saw that Roast Beef is how Ray pays attention and seeing's how Beef usually goes along with what Ray says as well, if there was ever a crying machine made, it is because Ray submitted the idea to a company (which produced six million units) and Cornelius was the only guy raw enough actually purchase it. <br/>

      As much as I love this little story about Mr. Bear waking up with an unfortunate decision on his chest, I've gotta say it. "Fancy new cryin' machine"? "A machine to help him practice ignore cryin'"? This is hell of weak.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The idea that even someone as dumb as Ray would skip over the concept of "the dude is crying" and go straight to "a machine that makes crying noises" because he just can't possibly imagine Mr. Bear ever crying, that sounds like bad fan fiction from the people on AssetBar who saw the Badass Games and subsequently insist that everything Cornelius has ever done reflects somehow on his BadAssness, like he's the new Chuck Norris or something.
