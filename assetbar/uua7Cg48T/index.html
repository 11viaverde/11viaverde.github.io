      God damnit I did the same thing. I think we've offered a valuable service though. One thing I did learn in Psych (and writing, funnily enough) that if someone really had no concern for the opinions of a particular group, they wouldn't need to express themselves to that group and they'd dissappear. I guess this extra spam is just some seriously twisted compliment.

      Seems that's changed over time, since ignore user is now an optional extra after laming. Though this was the first post I felt the need to mark as spam, only to find I don't have spam marking privelidges, which makes me wonder why the button is even there.  <br/>

      a good man is hard to find, and you are a good man!with talents like that, you'd be big in japan, johnsburg, illinois, kentucky avenue, virginia avenue, union square, heart attack and vine, and 9th and hennepin! those places are filled with warm beer and cold women. you'd probably be better without a wife. she would just be a black market baby, and the cause nothing but bad livers and broken hearts. these gun street jersey girls will have names like lucinda, martha, muriel, rosie, georgia lee, and alice. over time, they'll run you 'til the money runs out. let the only woman in your life be your mother, and have her picture in a frame. resist temptation, and soon you will reach the top of the hill! <br/>

      See, but the thing about MTV that most people seem not to realize is, they hate their participants as much as you do.  That's why they all get edited to look even MORE like assorted dicks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The network is totally cynical, they're laughing at the cast of  <em>The Real World</em>  the same way we do.  Do you think they're airing  <em>NEXT</em>  because they think it's a bunch of cool dudes and fire chicks that the teens are going to look up to?  Nah, they do it because it's dumb young people they can convince to do anything, and say anything.  Meanwhile, everyone is laughing at them.  The casting directors, the audience, the variety of big-wigs involved with production.  They all are in on the joke. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I love MTV, I love their whole deal.  Music videos be damned, give me more timebombs crying about a lack of proper workout equipment in the Real World house.

      While I suspect your questions might be rhetorical, I do have opinions on mass communications and the masses, based both on theory and practice, that I don't really want to get into here and now.  Suffice it to say, yes, there will always be a variation in intelligence and education, so there will always be a mass audience of lower taste.  But no, the media are more a reflection of their audience than a shaper of them.  And finally, the mass media are more massive than ever, despite the seeming fragmentation.

      Well, any given culture in a technologically advanced country is defined by its media. The problem is that "mass media" is not monolithic, and there is no one given "mass culture". Adorno turned out to be wrong when he claimed that capitalist society needs to enforce conformity to a dull standard. Instead, it has proven adept at maintaining its dominance through both creating and catering to images of diversity and individuality. As Heath and Potter argue in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201130523/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Sell">The Rebel Sell</a> , capitalism benefits from encouraging these things because they lead people to compete for them through consumption. Thus you have the Che Guevara t-shirt, Hot Topic, etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You hear a lot about the possibility of the Internet toppling mass media, but I'm not so sure. The big media companies just haven't caught on to its full potential, but when they do, they can just pump out the same dreck via Internet and still get enough people to watch it. The only difference will be that those who don't will have more choices of other stuff, which I guess is better.

Okay here: <br/> 
"In America, controlling information is a much more complicated process. Television and other media subtly influence the public by suggesting which products to buy, and where to eat. Choices are limited to those products (such as movies and televison shows) which support the agendas of the people in control of them. The public is addressed indirectly rather than directly. Information about how to live one%u2019s life is passed on to people through television shows. Americans then come to see the television shows as a reflection of their life, rather than as the source of that mode of living. The companies producing these television shows (and by extension the part of the government over which they have influence and are influenced by) don%u2019t always come up with ways in which to convey their messages, but rather choose those programs which come to them to be developed which support their interests." <br/>

      I can't really agree or disagree because I haven't read much on this.  Pogo is making some more general statements so I can (and I do) generally disagree with those.  Sure there will always be a mass audience of lower taste, but this does not automatically mean that there  will or will not always be a one-to-many broadcast medium to which this mass audience massively subscribes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Internet it's self can easily be and is becoming the next mass media television-style content distribution system.  The Internet can also support other distribution/interaction systems...   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Internet isn't much more advanced than the first telegraph in that it lets you remotely exchange basically still the same type of information.  There is a lot of information that doesn't send over a wire very well.  Meeting someone face-to-face is a whole different experience from metting via telegraph, e-mail, or Internet.  The mechanics of a telegraph, or of meeting face-to-face are, however, the same.  Information is being exchanged.  Will the Internet stop at co-opting telegraph-style information exchange?  Or will it go for more and more?  What happens when formerly manual-only information exchange mechanisms become networked and automated?  What is information?  Is it some intangible ether that can never be captured in a bottle and sent over great distances except in it's simplest telegraph form?  Or are there still secrets it is waiting to yield?  Will we one day control it more than it controls us? <br/>

      Achilleselbow, you talk about the the possibility of the Internet toppling mass media, but I maintain that the Net IS mass media, in that everyone connected to it can and often do access the same thing.  The Net is the most massive medium of all, subsuming all other media.  As for all the Marxists and other critics who assume the capitalists (or anyone) can control the masses through the media, people are not that easy to manipulate unless you work with what they already feel and believe.  So advertising draws on our exisiting needs and fears, and merely sells them back to us in new packages.  Very clever, really.

      From the late 1980s through mid 1990s, mtv aired less mainstream music late at night.  Back in that era, shows like 'Postmodern MTV,' '120 Minutes,' and 'Alternative Nation' turned me on to music that I wouldn't have discovered otherwise.  In other genres, they had 'Yo, MTV Raps!' when hip-hop was still evolving from a niche to a broadly popular style, plus a similar program (I forget the name) late at night for metal.  All of these shows seemed to have hosts who were knowledgeable and passionate about their respective musical styles. <br/>

      For the metal stuff, there was the original Headbanger's Ball.  It was a holy experience.  It was excellent.  I'm glad I wasn't the one who stepped in to defend old-school MTV.  It had great times back then.  Then they moved the videos to MTV2, and it was still good, because most people would watch Road Rules on the original, and the rest could watch eclectic music on MTV2.  Hell, there was even an MTVX that was all metal, all the time.  But then the dark times came, and music retreated to the strange, dark places, and I had to start either TRYING to find music, or just give up and join corporate America.

      I will share my opinions because I assume you always want to hear them.  I'm almost certain sje isn't a troll.  He's just slowly learning how to adapt his posting style to the board.  He ruffled a few feathers for a bit, but he's smoothing it up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think AIU was always intending to be a troll.  I'm betting strong that he was just trying to talk about Achewood and whatever other crap we discuss here, and his personal crazy made us shun him.  As a result, he decided to troll the boards to salve his wounded feelings.

      Yea, I don't know if this is true for everyone, but it's hard to fit in with the general tone of the board when you first start posting. I mean my initial forays on here were a fucking disaster, to the extent that I never check my inbox for fear that someone has responded to my douchebaggery from those days of yore (please don't go looking for them now). But eventually we get the hang of it on account of being functioning people who can adapt to different social situations. Most of us, that is.

      Achilleselbow, I did think you were a douche. Of course, you started before me, but I still thought all your early posts were obnoxious. Since then, you have been consistently funny and good, and you changed your avatar to an image of an Internet cartoon I do enjoy. Please, accept this v-chubb and use it in happiness and good health.

      I dated a high school girl while I was in college. This was the most actual of awesome things to do. Even better was living about a block away from the school and being allowed to leave school briefly during finals week between tests. Having the most dirty of things with a girl of school while school is in session? That is close to the peak of achievements. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We knew each other while we were both in high school together, only a year or two apart. This makes it awesome, not creepy. Trawling for high school girls can be made creepy unless you are Matthew McConaughey. It also helps if it is, for whatever reason, the 1970s.

      That guy has to update a lot more than once every five months.  I love that comic.  (there's a new one, by the way).  One of my top three, besides xkcd and Achewood. <br/>

      None of the haiku listed so far technically fit the haiku meter, as true haiku have 17 morae,  which are different than syllables.  What would be considered a single syllable in the english language is often comprised of as many as 3 morae, so true haiku do not usually contain 17 syllables.

      If you'd kindly direct your attention to what appears to be a duplicate of my first comment, you will notice that I opted to use 66.6% of the common ellipsis. <br/>

      It always baffles me how fat other people's cats are. I mean I know Persian cats are supposed to be fat, but other than that, is there such a big difference between breeds, or do most people just grossly overfeed their cats? My kitten is almost fully grown and she can still be scooped up quite easily with one arm. But then when I'm at someone's house, their cats look monstrous to me. Not only are they fat, but even their heads and paws are like twice as big. They have the overall size and mass of a small pig. It baffles me even further when I point out this fact to them and they maintain, despite all evidence to the contrary, that their cat is not fat. Is this a normal thing for people to have huge cats as such?

[typing]   <br/> 
 <strong>On The Relativity Of Evil And Size In Cats</strong> <br/> 
     The masculine feline is capable of maintaining a substantial quantity of evil relative to it's body size.  The evil is easily identified by the prodigious mass of flesh and muscle that is raised by the cat's immune system, believed to be Nature's preparation for a massive discharge of nefarious intent such as the "Double-leg-twisting crotch attack"(1). <br/> 
     The feminine feline, on the contrary, is supremely adapted at storing evil in small packages.  Due to a genetic aberration, the feminine cat is capable of absorbing the evil from situations (or indeed, from the atmosphere itself) and compacting it down for storage, allowing the beast to retain it's petite form.  While this marvel of genetic chance and personal development is impressive, it pales in comparison to the release mechanism at the feline's control.  This ingenious gland allows the cat to release significantly concentrated doses of fury in a range of quantities so broad, they range from full-on face attacks to the more subtle "vomiting in occasionally-used shoes" and the infamous "walking through a puddle of one's own urine to track kitty piss paw prints across your newly-cleaned and waxed floor". <br/>

Y'know, whenever I watch The Who destry there instruments, I always get a bit annoyed, like they are that drunk guy at the party who is taking everything too far. They were just too...British Invasion to be able to effectively pull off that kind of anger. Only Keith Moon had the destruction act down pat, thanks to his crazed eyes and manic stage mannerisms. So, for my money, we have to wait for the late seventies/early eighties for the kind of disaffected youth who could make instrument smashing into something to rile you up instead of bum you out. <br/>

      One of my chief worries about owning a dog who on occasion barks incessantly and long into the night is that one day one or several of my neighbours will take it upon themselves to dispatch it. And then, in their sleep-deprived ire, to drag me out into the garden, force to me my knees, and shoot me in my mouth in quite the same fashion. (Like a dog.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think being kept awake to think about these things is probably the chief disadvantage of owning such a dog.

      2. If the dog to be shot is owned by a neighbour, great cares must be taken given the fragile nature of the situation. Without just cause for the slaying, any manner of feuds* can arise from the fallout that arises. Offended guests, interruption of a ritual of christian nature, and third degree "cornrow chops" are exemplars of satisfactory excuses. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While executing the beast, great care must be taken so as to not give it any reason to believe that it's existence is in danger. Giving a dog midnight fear is extremely dishonourable in christian societies, and is a convictable offence in a growing number of jurisdictions. To prevent the fear, shots should be fired from a considerable distance, and on one's own property. The author personally recommends an honest Browning hunting rifle. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Great care must be taken the next morning with the handling of the dog's owner. However, if one is mindful of procedure he can make this phase of his ordeal the simplest. One must visit a liquor store immediately after, and purchase the following things: <br/> 
 Half-dozen beer, for self <br/> 
 AT LEAST two flasks of quality whiskey~ <br/> 
One beer should be drunk immediately to prevent creeping panic. The rest of the alcohol should be put in ice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The next morning, one should rise at sunrise and have another beer and a turkey sandwich. An hour after sunrise, he shoud then go to his neighbour with the chilled liqour and explain his situation to him plainly and as a christian. Anyone who was offended by the dog should be present, and women should show indications of distress. At the end of the apology, the liquor should be extended as a peace offering. If the apology was delivered correctly, the liqour will be accepted and the neighbour will have understood our subject's grievances, and thus he will be "off the hook". <br/> 
 <br/> 
*While the author and publisher has seen all manner of feuds arise from a shameful slaying, it should be noted that the vast majority are Appalachian-style "triple chicken" feuds. <br/> 
~If your own neighbour favours city liqours over whiskey, they should logically be purchased instead. However, the author expresses his disappointment at your choice to live amongst people with false tastes.

      It's one thing if you're staying up all night writing a paper or doing some other kind of work - watching the sunrise can be a really nice break from the toil. <br/> 
But for pure, straight insomnia, I agree, seeing the light outside my window and hearing the birds is the absolute low point of the night, when I realize I have an entire day ahead of me to somehow deal with.

      yes there are insomniacs on Assetbar.  I used to be an insomniac too, but not lately.  I started taking a small dose of gamma aminobutyric acid (aka 'gaba') as a treatment for bipolar disorder and it fixed the bipolar disorder, nervous anxiety, depression, and inattention tendencies, and it fixed the insomnia as well.  Available at your local health food store, and cheap.  Normal adult dosage is 100 to 300mg per day.  I hope this helps you weirdos out there.

      Yep it is indeed over the counter.  www.nowfoods.com makes it, and nowfoods stuff is carried in a lot of places.  for a list of local retailers, visit their (currently crashed?) web site.  for GABA, you probably have to go to a place that caters to people who are into that whole natural foods craze, like a specific health food store, as opposed to the vitamin aisle of your local supermarket.  The kinda place Pat would shop at...  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201130523/https://organicpharmacy.org/ingredient/Gamma-Aminobutyric.Acid.(GABA)">this place</a>  has it if you wanna just buy it online.  One word of caution - the stuff is commonly available in 500mg pills...  the recommended dosage is generally not over 300mg a day...  So unless you can find smaller pills, then you probably have to divide up a messy white powder to get a useful dosage... speaking of which, I don't suggest snorting the stuff... <br/> 
you might also want to do some research on possible side effects and such...  not everyone is going to benefit from gaba... I am guessing that it is maybe like adderall...  if your brain needs adderall, then adderall will help you... if your brain doesn't need adderall, it can fuck you up... maybe gaba is the same way?  Just because it is non-prescription doesn't mean that taking the whole bottle won't kill you, or even just one pill...  Good luck! :) <br/>

      See, I think shit like that is what gives the whole child-free thing a bad name. The reason I wouldn't want a child is very simply because I don't want to have to work a soul-crushing job just so I can have the resources to support a family, and also because I don't want to wake up one day to find myself wearing a Hawaiian shirt to cover my potbelly while I argue with the wife over whose turn it is to change the diapers. But it takes a special kind of nutcase to argue with a straight face that humans need to go extinct because it would be better for the environment, when here I was foolishly thinking that the reason we need to protect the environment is so it can better sustain our existence. The only way these people's position makes any sort of logical sense is if you actually believe that the Earth is some sort of sentient goddess whose existence is more important than ours, which I'm sure they do. Seriously, it's things like this that turn people towards the Republicans.

      The pill is cheap, it is easy to use, and it is reliable.  People realize they don't need 14 children to till the fields, and the cost of raising a child so that social services doesn't steal them is higher than it's ever been.

      It's hard to make a call on the homosexual thing because the idea of homosexuality as a personal identity only came into being within the last century or so. Before that, people didn't identify as heterosexual or homosexual, they just did both chicks and dudes according to the social protocols available.  <br/> 
I can see the benefits to claiming that it is genetic, but when you look at a culture like the ancient Greeks, it was pretty much ubiquitous, at least among the upper classes. So compared to that, there is probably  <em>less</em>  homosexuality now, but more people, homosexual and otherwise, not having children.

      <strong>Moonshining</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
When the presence of a moonshiner makes itself known in your neighborhood, it is generally considered good custom to meet informally with your neighbors and the moonshiner to "size up the situation". At minimum, it is necessary for neighbors to agree in which direction they will point when the police ask passersby which direction the moonshiner just sped off in, so as to lead them on the wrong trail. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The typical compensation on the part of the moonshiner for this service is one jar per house per month. For this reason, another common custom is to ask the moonshiner how much can be drunk at a single sitting before incurring blindness or "jake leg".

      <strong>Noodling</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
The proper protocol for discussing noodling in mixed company has long been in contention amongst the well known noodlers of our time; namely Sam "Linguine" Hooper and Jimmy "Limp-Noodle" Able.   These gentlemen put forth that discussing the intimacies of the pastime put it's cultural distinction into jeopardy, while insuring the inevitable downfall of the noodle society as a whole. Many a young noodler has bragged of his skills, as taught to him by his father-  only to be jeered at for bypassing the popular hook and line.  This has led to thinning of the young ranks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When bringing up the topic with a known noodler, always bring a bottle of strong liquor, and know that at least half the bottle will have to be drunk before he will be willing to discuss his passion with an unknown. This is key.  When he does preface the subject, it is very important that you not bring up the new fangled ideas of hooks, lures, and lines, as it will cause him great distress and likely get you ejected from his company.  Even worse, would be to mention the idea of a female noodler (despite the famous stories of Bobbie Sue Renton, "Noodle Queen of Kentucky", soon to be made into a big Hollywood movie) This will also get you a boot to the back of your Wranglers. If you are lucky enough to get to a discussion with a known noodler before he is too intoxicated, always maintain your respectful demeanor.  If he is to ask for your company at the local crick the next day, be sure to provide the alcohol, as the privilege of watching a talented noodler is rare.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
While observing, there are a few general tips to laymen:  Do not ask for technical advice or guidelines for your own noodling, you will instantly mark yourself an outsider.  You must at least attempt to noodle once, if you do not, you must claim an injury to your "best noodlin finger", and I would recommend breaking your finger in advance for such an occasion.  Lastly, never ever bring a woman.   <br/>

      See, these internet broads require large amounts of subtlety.  You gotta hide it behind entendres.  Wordplay is better than foreplay.  Even better, mix it up.  Go subtle, subtle, subtle, BANG.

      When the poor little McCaul-Hill boy of Execla farms showed up to the door of Josepiah Gunlinn, bearing presents of beer, the elderly farmer paused in his repeated shooting of his barking dog. Believing the knocking was caused by the vengeful spirit of his deceased dog, the elderly farmer put seven six shells through the door, striking the boy with five among them. He was killed instantly, and the beer it did mingle with the blood on the cold, hard ground. Three nights later, the elderly farmer was savaged by the vengeful spirit of the dog. The fancy 'city-slickers' believed that it was the doing of the Mcaul-Hill patriarch, but we country folk know that no man may commit such savagery upon the intestines of another god-fearing man, no matter how diseased he may be of mind. <br/>

      so yeah. killing the family dog.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i worked on a farm one summer. the dude was fucking crazy. but hilarious. he told me many stories of killing the ranch dog.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
he'd get out his hunting rifle (Seiko 30-06) and take the shot from way back. like he was hunting. he and his dad did the same to his uncle's horses which were toothless, emaciated and their hooves were waaaaaay overgrown. they took these shots from way out.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
he told me about the time his ex gf's toy 'something' mated his female pitbull. it produced rancid offspring and he did not suffer them a day of life. (close your eyes, this gets bad). he took each one and shot 'em in the head with a .22.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i got a buddy who is a farmer up in Chico. he said he had to kill his ranch dog when he was young. his dad told him how to do it. he put a hot dog on the end of a .22 and shot it at point blank range.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
anyways.. just thot i'd let you know that this isn't a joke. it's the real thing.

      That would be a good idea, if you were laying on the ground and using a pistol. Instead by having the dog put his mouth around the muzzle you pretty much guarantee the .22 round going explosively out the side or back of the dog's neck. Blood and fur and noise everywhere, the brain totally missed and the offending dog still alive, psychological trauma for every mammal within 2 miles ensues.

      It's kind of you to help out this way.  It's kind of cheeky on Gladdi's part, isn't it?  I mean, I would think that he, who has suffered so much from the sting of the Lame, would refrain from applying them to someone only trying to interpret his work for the greater public.

      He lamed both me and Loneal several times in the past for no discernible reason. I get the sense that he does not like me in general. I thought he might be aiu for a while, but then I realized that can't be true because he makes references to TV shows and other things that normal people who aren't antisocial psychopaths know about. So I guess I'll just have to deal. Boo hoo.

I think that Glad is actually Chris himself, like how whenever Zeus came down to be with the people he took the form of an animal. <br/>

I think that AIU is Randall Munroe, the guy who does xkcd. <br/>

      I believe I can shed some light on that account, achilleselbow.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've wanted to come clean for months.  I'd never taken money to betray my conscience before, but truth be told no one had ever offered, so that's more a matter of circumstance than morality.  Lord knows I'm not asking for absolution, not now.  Not as I'm about to betray my benefactor.  And for what?  Certainly not any principled "truth will out" bullshit.  Maybe I'm just glad that it's all gonna be over. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*shakily raises scotch to mouth, watches the legs run down the inside of the tumbler as the Glenlivet begins to warm the gut* <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've been receiving substantial monthly stipends from the one and only Mr. Thomas Pynchon to casually post here for the past ten months.  The first plain manila envelopes showed up in February of 2007, with no addresses or postmarks, save for the muted trumpet, stamped in cold blue in the top left corner, which was to become my sigil, the bleak omen under which I was to live. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*more scotch* <br/> 
 <br/> 
To this day I don't know why he picked me.  Hell, I don't even know how he knew I read Achewood.  But after everything I've been through...Hell, I don't know how anyone knows anything anymore.  Or how anyone could keep anything secret from anyone else. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The envelope contained several small sheafs of high-denomination US bills (there were problems with obtaining unmarked Canadian bills, which made the whole thing that much trickier for me, being north of the border), and explicit instructions, bashed out on an old obscure make of  Underwood typewriters that had only been on the market for three months in 1945 (at least according to the typographical historian I surreptitiously contacted) regarding registering and posting on the Achewood assetbar while using a Pynchon-based avatar.  I was to be put on retainer by Mr. Pynchon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While the money sure as shit told me I was dealing with a major player, I had no assurances that I was dealing with the real Pynchon.  Until the next envelope showed up.  This one contained multiple pages from  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Against the Day</span> , which his goddammn  <em>agent</em>  didn't even know existed until June.  When the novel was finally published, I bought a copy from a bookstore I'd never even walked past (to ensure getting an untampered copy) - the pages matched perfectly.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even more shocking were the highlighted words and phrases from the pages I'd been sent.  The highlighted sections unmistakably drew the figures of dozens of Achewood characters and motifs.  Highlight all of the occurrences of any of the words used in Beef's "Notorious L.I.N.C.O.L.N." rap on a certain page, and Nice Pete's face would suddenly leap off the page at you.  Highlight all of the words that began with the same letter as the names of Ray's AIBOs in  <br/> 
[url=https://achewood.com/index.php?date=11222002 <br/> 
]this strip[/url] (the first word beginning with S, then the next beginning with P, and so on) in a particular chapter, and you suddenly had a forty page flip book depicting Cartilage Head performing in exquisite detail.  Pynchon had hidden innumerable Achewood gags in  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Against The Day</span> , picto-linguistically.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What was all of this about?  Why was I being paid?  The idea was that if a typical slacker grad student appeared on assetbar using a Pynchon avatar to connote deep intellectualism with a minimum of effort, any Pynchon related discussion on the board would be be given a typically detached hipster veneer, with no danger of substantive Pynchon analysis spontaneously erupting.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
In a nutshell, I was a relief valve.  Guaranteed a middling and unsuspecting environment, Pynchon could then continue to post on assetbar in safety and secret.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for Pynchon's identity on assetbar...Hell.  I still don't think I can tell you outright, no matter how many times I've bolted out of troubled sleep with the secret on my lips, wanting to scream it to the night, but never knowing for certain that only the night would hear me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the truth is I've known that something's been up for the past three months.  I'm seeing the muted trumpet everywhere: stamped onto beer mats in my local, scribbled into books I leaf through at random in the library.  Once...once even smudged into the grime on my shower tile.  The phone rings, no one's there, but after I've hung up I swear I can hear that damnable couplet drifting up from the receiver: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>No hallowed skein of stars can ward, I trow, <br/>
who%u2019s once been set his tryst with Tristero!</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I must've done something to have become a liability.  Maybe the typewriter expert gave me up.  Maybe I gave a too-sly look to a friend at a pub when Pynchon came up in conversation.  Hell, maybe they thought that  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201130523/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uuaddWsKs#comment_118">Batman panel</a>  wasn't funny.  You guessing that Pynchon was posting here's finally given me the courage to wipe the slate clean, achilleselbow, even if you're miles off as far as which poster is Pynchon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like I say, I can't tell you outright.  I can't tell if that's loyalty, base, misguided loyalty to the man who will be my destroyer, or if it's a commitment to the spirit of the whole sordid affair...the idea that the narrative, the mystery should survive even if I don't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I can give you one clue.  One clue, my sole trump card, and then my shoddy role as spear-carrier in this pathetic show will be through, for better or for worse, or, more likely, for neither. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You ever wonder why there's such a long gap between Pynchon's books?  Heh.  Lemme tell you something.  He ain't spending all that time between publication dates researching and writing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*a last sip of scotch, but the flavour can't punch through the fog that seems to surround everything* <br/> 
 <br/> 
He's reading slash.

      Well I'm no Gladi8orex but I am a little bit outside the norm.  Didn't mean to provoke anything...  Just imitating Mr. G there.  I just wonder about retardation sometimes.  I also wonder what my gf's dog is thinking sometimes.  I don't think he is quite as self-aware as a human is...  that makes me wonder if there is some theoretical being, or perhaps as of yet undiscovered space alien, that is way more self-aware and sentient than us humans, who is out there somewhere, wondering "what's it like to be human?  What's it like to be retarded like that?"

      His feasible post length is at odds with the theory of him being a possible aiu account. <br/>

If you remember alreadyinuse's early posting, it was essay upon essay of senseless contention. A habit I fel it would be hard for him to break out of if he began posting his opinions again.

      Guys, I have a confession to make: <br/> 
All this time, I've actually been part of AIU Hivemind.  I'm a secret-sys-op, meant to infiltrate the Assetbar caste and take it down from the inside. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is one thing my creator didn't count on however; I became human.  I learned how to love, and how to live, and how to think, and how to feel.  I watch sunrises now, and I laugh as loud as I can. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am man.  I am incorrigible, and I will never be brought back to pasture.   <br/>

      There is a hentai series called New Angel and in the second episode the typical sex-crazed high-school boy protagonist comes across a girl about to jump off the school rooftop. He convinces her to at least have sex with him before she jumps because it won't matter to her anyway and she "won't even have to worry about birth control". I love the Japanese, I really do.

      your avitar is one of the best woodenteeth.  it is demur, inoffensive, non-goofy, non-tacky, and only the slightest hint of maybe starting to go bald.  Or it could just be the lighting.  And cool glasses too.  And a nice calming color scheme. <br/> 
 <br/> 
octafish:  great lighting, subversive, comedic, and serious at the same time.  The animated hand, however, is an affront to the senses and to the part of the brain that is trying to process your avitar, but can't, because it keeps getting distracted by that damn hand.  I try holding my finger on my screen over the hand, but it's no use, I still know it's there, and I even know where it is in it's cycle.  It's like sitting next to someone on the bus who is jiggling their leg up and down at a rapid rate.  After a few minutes, it subsumes everything you are thinking about and it's all you can do to keep from bludgeoning the person to death.  You get off the bus, and 10 minutes later you are still deeply troubled by the idea of that knee jumping up and down somewhere along the bus route. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In conclusion, both your avitars blow my mind, but for different reasons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pogo:  Pretty good avitar, although, now you're tinkering with the gender identity that you project.  Not that there's anything inherently wrong with that.  But keep working at it;   <em>you</em>  might find something...

I have no use for blowjobs or fingering of my anus or any of the other methods you female types like to use because it is just part of the  <em>ho-mo-sex-u-al agenda</em>  and I am happy with my American Pies and apple flags thankyouverymuch. <br/>

      I was at the front of a punk show when I was younger than I am now... and my flannel-patterned jacket came off and was thrown onto stage. It was at that point the fairly astute lead singer picked it up and pointed out that not only was it flannel but it had press studs. I let the damn thing get thrown to the back of the stage for the rest of the gig. The bouncer gave it back to me later, only after leaving a considerable downpayment of pride. <br/>

      I am also Pro-Clit, but for a different reason. I went to a local art gallery to see an exhibit of some of some of Picasso's lesser known etchings and sketches. Pretty much every piece featured fairly prominently at least one malformed vagina, as well as a massive shiggity-schwa (which we affectionately dubbed "monstercocks"). It didn't matter what the situation being depicted was (a couple even had the Pope looking on lecherously), somehow there would always be a couple of sex organs on display. Distorted though they may be, however, the ladyparts were still rather more aesthetically pleasing than the Leaning Towers of Manhood adorning the walls. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suppose my point is that clits, and the fleshy bits surrounding them, are rather pleasant to look upon and can be likened to pretty things like flowers and what have you, as opposed to the man bits. I mean, when you get right down to it, penises are pretty ridiculous looking things.  <br/>

      <strong>Ode to a Displaced Post</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh post, my meaningless post <br/> 
So far from your origin <br/> 
The spark that gave me thought <br/> 
And gave you life <br/> 
 <br/> 
What are you doing so far down here post? <br/> 
Where did you come from post?  <br/> 
What meaning do you have now post? <br/> 
What are they going to make of you now post? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Two words, alone, without meaning <br/> 
Lost in the ravaged playground of Assetbar <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think I loved you once post <br/> 
No longer, no longer, <br/> 
You failed me, as I failed you <br/> 
And in failure we are joined as one.

      I don't know what I'm looking at, but I like it a lot.  My mom yelled at me when I showed it to her though.  I asked her if she wanted me to go to my room like my usual punishment but she said "No!" And then she said yes, but I have to keep the door open! <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I can't sleep with the door open because of all the lights!  I mean, I need a small night-light to sleep, but this is a bit much! So then I got up to turn off the lights.  But my mom said she needed it to pay taxes, and I was like "But  <em>Mommm . . .</em> .  I need the light off to sleep!" but she just shook her head.  "Well, can I at least have some warm milk?"  And she said sure.  And then I saw a bag of Chips Ahoy! and I love Chips Ahoy!  But when I tried to have some she got mad at me.  :(.  So then I got mad at her and threw the frying pan at her head.  But it missed and she got mad so I had to take out a knife from the drawer, and now I'm on this computer looking at porn, trying to find more pictures like your avatar.  It is fun, and I am learning a lot! :) <br/> <br/> <br/>

      I'll probably get lamed all to hell for saying hit, but this is how it begins, and is the fate of every web comic or widely read blog. First the author gets kinda famous, everyone's all happy, an explosive period of productivity follows. Then, a book deal and other things follow. Special projects start to eat away at time spent on the original source of success. There are periods of sporadic intense activity, interspersed with no updates, sometimes for a week, sometimes two. Then, the author starts to focus completely on other projects, and the original source material that these projects are based upon is forgotten. Updates are on a yearly basis or biannually. The author, having neglected the source of his fame for projects tangentially related to it, realizes that without his original material people have lost interest and his work is considered non-vital. He fades into obscurity and semi-retirement, eking out a living as a guest comic for other new talents.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think this will happen to Onstad. He'll probably just quit one day and open a successful store that deals in fashionable fireplace accessories.

      Chuvak all binding Onstad to his own bed with leather restraints.  IV nutrient drip keeps him alive and just lucid enough to see the computer monitor set on the tray in front of him.  Monitor all displaying Achewood, last updated seven months ago.  No screen saver to make it go away.  A forest of Nice Pete air fresheners hang from the ceiling to hide the stench.  Chuvak letting Onstad out of the restraints only once a year to update the site.  All object lesson to other web cartoonists the virtue of a regular update schedule. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chuvak all spending the rest of his time force feeding Scott Kurtz cans of Chef-Boy-R-Dee and sending Tycho boxes with Gabe's head in them.
