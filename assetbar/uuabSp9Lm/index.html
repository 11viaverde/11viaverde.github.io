      Apparently this is also an Ireland thing.  I was there back in June and on TV in a bar in Dublin I saw a horrible drunk-driving awareness commercial.  The basic story was that a guy is driving drunk, he swerves across the road and hits a young couple walking along a fence at the edge of a pasture.  The boyfriend gets pinned on top of the girl and she has to stare into his face as he slowly dies, then it goes through flashes of each person's family and how their lives have been ruined.  The special effects are at least CSI quality and it goes on for about two minutes (which is quite long for a commercial, at least in the US).  It must have been new cause I heard several other bar-goers cry out in shock and disgust.  It certainly was effective, it's just a shame someone felt it was necessary.

I wish people would just stop driving drunk or speeding or talking on their cell phone while they drive. <br/> 
I guess statistics aren't enough for some people. They don't notice the degradation in their ability to react until they have to react to something, and are unable. Or until someone manages to show them something visceral enough to make them pay attention.

      That wasn't the worst one though, I remember one on in Ireland when I was younger where the driver is flirting with a woman in another car and he swerves to avoid pedestrians and clips the pavement, and just mows down a child who was playing in his yard.  <em>In his yard...</em> <br/> 
That gave me nightmares for sometime, I must have been around 10/13

      Where I live we don't need these signs, we just need people yelling at you for going 20 miles an hour in a residential area (the limit is 25 for those unawares). Of course, there are no children outside when this happens, I could maybe hit her imaginary children? <br/>
