      I can't even figure out what he means.  Is he tapping his left hand with his right hand, or is he tapping his left hand against something else?  I'm a long way from solving this mystery :(

      This is actually a thing.  I used to sit next to a guy at work who would tap the base of his palm twice agianst the front of the desk, and then tap the tips of his fingers twice behind the mouse before being able to touch the mouse itself.  He had a number of other ticks and spasms, but this was the mouse related one.  It was a constant ballet of movement in my periphery, but I never wanted to ask him about it in case it was a medical condition rather than just habit.  I heard that he developed it his sophomore year of college, one semester he didn't twitch constantly, next semester he did.

      When I was at the library, there was one dude who would click  <em>constantly,</em>  and I mean god damned  <em><strong>constantly</strong></em>  no matter what page he was at. It was like he was scared the page was going to slip away, much like a canvas being blown by the wind, and he has to keep clicking on it to keep it down.  <br/>

      But do you highlight and unhighlight at 23highlights/second? Twice I have seen people do this in my classes on their laptops while perusing their email or news-sites, all hell of A.D.D. I can just see the next generation being taught using blinking powerpoint presentations where the font and background colors switch off. All pupils darting up and down. All mouths foaming. All circle jerking the guy next to you getting hot to Heidegger.

      I actually sort of do this, sure it's not 23highltights/second but, I do have a habit of highlighting text over and over again when I am reading it. Also, I tend to read text conversations out loud immediately after I finish typing them.

Actually I am typing right now, but as I was reading spinynorman's comment, it was all going highlighted, then unhighighted, then half-highlighted, then you have to highlight the *other* half to balance it out (otherwise you've highlighted too much on just one part of the paragraph). <br/>

      I started to develop this habit for a while because if the window lost focus or you were focused on a text box within a page, the scroll wheel would not work properly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I taught myself to stop, because I kept accidentally clicking links, especially on pages that tag words but don't highlight them as links.
