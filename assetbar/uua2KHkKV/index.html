      If your only crime is getting trashed and trying to make the sweetest of loves to your wife, her rebuff was probably a favor to your libido.  <br/>

As time advances, your wife will get used to saying no and you will get used to hearing it. Think of it like a batting average -- if you get a hit 3 out of 10 tries, you're a fucking hall-of-famer. Honestly, if you are any higher than that, you're not making the moves nearly enough. <br/>

      a stranger on the internet says you should resign yourself to some kinda mediocre fate.  Well I'll tell you mediocrity is sort of the default state of being and self-awareness of the human being and therefore also of human culture.  Even this strip seems to veer in that direction now and again.  You can do better.  Everyone can.  Sometimes people do.

      It seems the message you're conveying here is, "If she doesn't want to have sex with you when you want to have sex with her, then your life is mediocre."   <br/>

I have probably misread this, but it really seems silly on first impression.

      Take heart.  Its seems that you are not out of control yet; you are just softening the edges of a rough patch in your marriage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once the honeymoon is over, it is typical that a couple will struggle to define themselves in their new circumstance.  The pregnancy makes all of these changes more acute.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Things will get better. <br/>

      no, chubby chicks can be sexy.  I didn't mean to imply otherwise, despite my having explicitly said so.  I was being lazy.  What I meant to say is that, for some reason, these chubby chicks (victorian era) don't look sexy.  Maybe it's the Marilyn Manson style eye shadow, maybe it's... it's... the hair style?  The facial expressions that just always look... mundane?  I dunno.  I do know that it's awful of me to dis dead people like that.  Kinda a slap in the face of nostalgia and such. <br/> 
 <br/> 
hey but you remember that sci-fi movie The 13th Floor?  I don't remember exactly but I think there was some victorian era chicks in that movie.  It was partly set in like the 1800s.  That mighta been sexy.  I don't recall exactly.  I do remember that it was certainly nostalgic.  <br/> 
  Anyway that movie had an awesome premise.  There was this virtual reality they created in this office on the 13th floor of this building, kinda like a holodeck on star trek, but then, some of the computer-generated characters in the virtual reality gained sentience... and figured out that they were in a virtual reality... and somehow or other it was possible for real people to visit the virtual reality. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's interesting that people in some cultures have lately started to prefer skinny chicks, and yes, that has really gone to a friggin' extreme, like, wayyy skinny chicks.  Our culture is loosing it's mind...  Personally, I dig way skinny chicks, but I think that's because I'm a pedophile more than anything. har de har har.  hmmm. yeah skinny chicks are sexy because they are inherently higher resolution.  The more fat a chick has on her, the less information you can infer about her body type, and for that matter, fat also dissimulates the exact positioning of facial muscles, thus reducing the resolution of facial expression.  I bet if you did a research study and you adjusted for other factors, you'd probably find that guys with better eye sight are more likely to go for skinnier chicks.  So why does all this visual information matter?  I think that it matters now more than ever to people because our culture is loosing it's mind...  In the past few decades we've introduced information technologies, most notably the TV, which have really accelerated the rate with which we introduce information into our decision making processes, and the resolution with which we perceive information.  Look at McD's...  McD's is arguably by far the most successful quick-serve business, but when you compare it to the competition, the differences are not that significant... but the consumer is now perceiving even minute differences in serve time, in consistency, in appearance of food, in taste, in consistency of taste, and it all adds up to competitors like Burger King being relegated to second-class status just as the fat chick has been. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So what can I say... what we know as the human is mostly a creature that is programmed with information...  To be human now, is, on average, a profoundly different experience than to have been human 20, 50, 100, 1000 years ago...  It's a bell curve... there is some overlap, there always were and always will be some whose experience was and is on the far end of the bell curve.  But that bell curve is there, most people fit in the middle of it, and it evolves over time.  I have a theory that one group within that bell curve is fat people, and over time, their position in that bell curve shifts around.  In the USA today, right, poverty and being fat kinda goes hand in hand... many of the cheapest foods and beverages are the ones highest in sugar and fat, and also consumption patterns of the poor are skewed towards prepared foods which again make you fat.  Also, poor people are less well educated.  The environment of the poor person in the USA (but not in all countries), on average, tends to be skewed towards less diversity of sensory stimulation, especially now that our culture and it's technology is shifting towards giving and receiving stimulation via relatively expensive technologies, leaving relatively inexpensive technologies (radio, broadcast TV) to become wastelands that would bore the tits off of anyone.  Couple this decreased stimulation with the fact that poor people are fatter, and voila, you have a recipe for kids to grow up with dumb fat parents who exhibit far less dynamic facial expression. <br/> 
 <br/> 
but man, show me a buxom lady who exhibits facial expression, and I think that is so sexy.  e.g. I have a crush on this lady: <br/>

dude what the hell!!!!  your heart can't supply blood to that much body!!!  anyone that fat needs to loose weight... it's a premature death sentence.  And that's sad man.  I had an acquaintance who was a few hundred pounds overweight, and he died for a heart attack recently, at the age of like 40 something.  what the hell!   <br/>

You absolutely have a point that media hyperbole makes things out to be more significant than they are, but if you're gonna say something's not significant, let's here more than just anecdote to back it up.  it's too easy to mix up your own personal prejudices with your anecdotal observations, and jesus christ you sound like a prejudiced right wingnut this time.

      I picked the first two women I could think of neither of whom was unrealistically skinny, with Shannon Elizabeth on the thinner side and Drew Barrymore on the chubbier. The fact that I couldn't find better examples and that they are both from the late 90's/early 00's just shows that I haven't watched TV/kept up with pop culture in a while.

      Looks like someone needs to improve their reading comprehension. I didn't say that was the range of female body types, I said that it's the range most guys are fine with, and that was a pretty conservative estimate anyway.

      I don't know if she's lost weight since then, but I remember Drew Barrymore being somewhat chunky. Not in a bad way, but if you think she is unrealistically skinny, then I don't know what to tell you. People seem to be unable to find a middle ground between extremes. Just because runway models are freakish and alien-looking doesn't mean that the 400-pound lady in unflattering shorts strolling down the Wal-Mart aisle should "feel good about herself" and "accept her body".

      I have to agree.  A person can feel anyway they want about their body.  A person can enjoy being fat and with a huge nose etc., but they should probably not expect others to find them attractive, or demand that others find them attractive, that they deserve it.

      Feminists don't blame it on straight males, they blame it on the ingrained patriarchy in our society. You must understand that it doesn't matter what the average guy on the street finds attractive, girls and women are told implicitly, mostly through advertising, that they are  <em>never attractive enough</em> . We can never live up to the Photoshopped ideal, but we are told that we can, if we buy all the right products. To be unfeminine is to be ridiculous and to be feminine one must buy things.

      Men are also told that we will never, ever measure up. Women want guys with more money, bigger dicks, and abs like the OED. You think men aren't told "If you want women to find you attractive you need to own this car"? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Everyone is sold an ideal that they cannot achieve. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To an even greater extent even without advertising we will all want to achieve an impossible ideal. People come into the world with more insecurity than could ever be taught.

      [[People come into the world with more insecurity than could ever be taught.]] <br/> 
 <br/> 
I disagree. Little children are not insecure- this is a fear-based learned behavior. (And is thankfully un-learnable with practice). Unfortunately, most people spend their whole lives being incredibly insecure and living in fear. But we do have a choice!

      Defining "having needs" as insecurity....interesting point, considering everyone has needs. <br/>

      Insecurity is a matter of self-awareness and self-doubt. Babies/small children don't have this. Physical needs (hunger, projectile vomiting, shitting, whatever else the little parasites do) are different than insecurity. Insecurity would be like "I think mommy loves the dog more than me" or "daddy drinks because I cry". And that kind of thing is trained into them as they are domesticated.

      What about them? Who gives a shit? You know what this problem boils down to? Not fucking thinking for yourself enough. And here I don't necessarily mean "yourself" as in YOU personally, howl.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like belgand pointed out, media tells us men we're not good enough too. You think I sit around being angry at the patriarchy or the matriarchy or whatever for this? No. I don't. You know what I do instead? I don't give a shit and I do what I want. I think I'm probably a lot happier this way than I would be otherwise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I think people who give so much attention and blame (and therefore, credence) to the "patriarchy" and "advertising" for their problems with perception of men or women really just need to learn to think for themselves. I've never dated a girl who looks like a movie star or belongs in a commercial, and frankly, I don't really want to. I have my own standards of attractiveness, and what "the media" tells me has very little to do with those standards. And I highly doubt I'm anywhere near alone in this.

      The problem is that people really can't choose how they feel all the time.  It's conditioning.  Most people with a fear of insects know they aren't going to be harmed by them.  You can tell a person with a fear of flying that it is statistically much safer than driving, but that won't change anything.  Emotions are very resistant to facts.  Sometimes they listen, but sometimes they don't.   <br/> 
I used to think that girls who starved themselves must be stupid or something, because don't they know that no one cares if they are average weight, and that many people find people that thin incredibly unattractive.  But for the past few years I've been feeling utterly horrible about myself because I am a virgin.  Shows and movies like American Pie, and soon everything just made me feel like I was totally inadequate, and the reason why I am so unsucessful with the ladies is because of something internal, unchangable.  Now, these are clearly very different examples, but they are similar because it shows just how powerful the media can be over how people judge themselves.  No amount of reassurance, no amount of facts will help me, because I will still hold myself to an ideal that I really shouldn't.  The only thing that can change someone like that is emotional and psychological support.  Not just logical support by itself, although it can help. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So the people who are weak and vulnerable, do they deserve to starve to death for being weak?  No, the advertisers need to be held responsible.  And besides, it is totally unfair that women need to fight against these extra barriers that men don't have to deal with, with appearance.  It's cool that you are so well-adjusted that you can just ignore everything, but to let them take advantage of people who are weaker is just wrong.

I disagree wholeheartedly. We have control over our own realities, and trying to hold someone else responsible is just total Victim behavior. (Something so many people are trapped inside!). It's always someone else's fault, blah blah blah. Nope. We have choice. We can choose to not have a TV, not read the fashion magazines. I don't for a second buy that shit that someone else is responsible for our reality, or the way we feel about ourselves. Don't like your reality? Change it. No one is going to do it for you.

      We're not talking about reality, we're talking about feelings.  Do you think that a schizophrenic can just stop hallucinating because he is being irrational?  Do you think that a depressed person's serotonin receptors will reuptake (or whatever)?  It's not that simple.  They need help, not people making them feel worse.  Some people are shallow, and some people don't try, etc.  They should try harder.  But as it is, basically good people are suffering who don't deserve it.   <br/> 
It's not as simple as not watching TV, or not buying fashion magazines.  Are they not supposed to look at billboards either? dense?  Maybe they will be even more unhappy without a computer, TV, going into the city, looking at magazines.  Should a person seculde herself on an island next?  Because every person that person will talk to will be biased in some way about some things that will make that person feel bad.  Do you think that only advertisers and the media make fun of chubby people?

      Mental illness (schizophrenia, depression) is different than feelings. I'm talking about the majority of us who don't have schizophrenia or major depression- we can choose to feel however we'd like. Including- feeling like a victim, feeling insecure, blaming others for our emotions. Or we can just realize that we have a choice to be happy, a choice to feel secure, a choice to not let the realities of others affect us. (It's nice!)

I disagree with you. Perhaps you should go ask your college professors about that one, lil' dude. And, as much as it doesn't affect me, it doesn't do much for your credibility when you resort to name-calling when someone doesn't agree with your views.

      That's not how it works. It doesn't magically get better once you stop being a jerk. Your actions/words are all we have to go on- if you're being a cock to strangers, strangers will think you're a cock. (it's up to you whether or not you choose to care about that). They won't NOT think you're a cock until there's tons more non-cock responses after that, because first impressions of You As Cock are hard to shake off. And, if it's to the point where people are ignoring you on here, you're Forever a Cock as far as they're concerned.

      Why?  Because I have opinions that not everyone else has here?  I'm pretty sure that my opinions on these matters aren't that unusual.  And I do like arguing things a lot, but not to make people upset.  I do, however, sometimes make people upset when they make me upset when I perceive that they are ignoring many of the things I say.

      I'm sorry spicyponyhead.  I'm sure you're not an idiot or thick-skulled or whatever.  I know where you are coming from, but I just think it's kinda dangerous thinking.  Somewhat similar to thinking that poor people are poor because they are lazy, and that rape victims deserve to be raped for going into a bad neighborhood.  I am not saying you believe these things, but that it seems to be along the same vein.  It's like a Nietzschian way of thinking that sort of bugs me.  I honestly think 90% of humans are weak things, easily swayed by everything around them, and it is quite a struggle for them, and they need help.  I do get annoyed though, when people look for things to be offended about.  A lot of people do that, and it's insincere and annoying and wrong.  But as it is, a lot of girls suffer health problems and die because of advertising, and they can not turn it off like most people can.  They have a disorder, just like basically all of us to some extent (well, that wouldn't follow the official definition of disorder, but still) and corporations are being irresponsible by continuing to push that message.  I don't, however, care if someone says "he gypped me".   <br/> 
But yeah, you're not stupid, and I am a dickhead.  Sorry about that.

It's dangerous thinking that we are responsible for our own realities, and can't just mindlessly blame others for our situation and our feelings? It's dangerous thinking to not go through life constantly butthurt and caring so much what other people think about you? <br/>

      Not mindlessly.  People shouldn't focus obsessively on what others think of them.  People should try their best. <br/> 
What is dangerous is thinking that people are 100% responsible for their reality.  This is not true.  We are enslaved to our own faulty minds.  Just like how you wouldn't blame a person for having depression, you shouldn't blame a person for being sad.  You can encourage the person to think happy thoughts, to stop certain cycles of reasoning.  But it is not as though the person who has depression has an actual germ in him that affects his brain.  I think the difference is quantity, not quality although I am not sure about that, to be honest.

      But isn't it a little unfair for these people to have to shut themselves out of society to be happy?  Isn't it sad that that is the only option they have?  And again, that won't really stop the feelings.  The feelings of being inadequite are already there.   <br/> 
Whenever someone mentions getting laid or something, I feel really terrible about myself because I am a virgin.  I know not to blame them, because it is an idiosyncrasy I have, and they have no way of knowing about it, and it's not really destructive.  But if many girls are killing themselves by starving, that's a much bigger problem, only because corporations want to. . .what?  Does it really help with their business that much that their models are that thin?  I never understood it.

      I'd be lying if I said this stuff didn't affect me at all. I don't measure up to the kind of guys you see in GQ or on Levi's commercials, and, sure, sometimes I wish I did. But even if you disregard every form of media, you're still going to run into people and situations that make you feel insecure from time to time. It's unavoidable. You ask a girl out and she says no, obviously it's going to make you wonder why and ponder the possibility that you're not attractive or witty or whatever. But there's a difference between that and letting popular standards of attractiveness/intelligence/whatnot decide your self-worth for you. Quite frankly, if you're weak-willed enough to let the media decide for you how good of a person you are, that's your own fault, not advertisers'.

      Your dead mother is a slut and a banged her everynight when she had cancer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Do you choose to not get offended by that if it applies to you?  There is a difference between someone being insincerely whiny for attention and someone genuinely feeling bad.  No one can make you feel anything, but situations can.  You can not choose to be affected, and if you think that, you are a moron.  You can choose how much you think about something.  You can choose to distract yourself.  But you can not choose your initial emotional reaction, n o more than how someone can choose to not have a phobia.  That's not how people work.  I'm not saying that, say, rape victims should blame every little problem they have on their rape and not move on (I have heard that counselors for them force the idea on them that all their problems are a result of that one moment, but I don't know if this is true.  But either way, it's wrong if it is true); I'm saying that we shouldn't be making rape jokes.  You shouldn't tell an anorexic girl that she's fat for the lulz "lulz, I'm not responsible, she is!  lulz".   <br/> 
But that is just being a kind person, you know?  But whether something is offensive isn't the biggest deal.  What the big deal is is that advertising is doing bad things to society.  TV shows, commercials, etc, which imply that women are not as intelligent as men, and belong in the home will result in discrimination to even the strongest-willed women.  PEople saying "that's gay" just reinforce the belief that being gay is a bad thing, resulting in discrimination.  Why should they have to fight extra hard to get what we get easily?  HAving these ads result in actual deaths.  If they are weak-willed and foolish for letting the ads get to them, does that mean they deserve death?  You ahvce to realize the consequences of your actions, and realize that weaker people don't deserve this.  And it'snot as easy as saying "You're being foolish".  Not at all.

Actually, yes you can. And you can also choose the reactions that come after that first reaction, too. If you walked up to me and said that whole 'dead mother' thing, I'd just laugh. Same as if you called me fat, or ugly, or whatever. I would choose not to be offended, because I don't take what others say personally. Just like I don't take ads that tell me I'm too fat/unfashionable/won't be complete until I buy a product XYZ personally. It takes practice, but it is possible. And it's super fucking awesome once you break free of the reactionary lifestyle of constantly being butthurt by what other people say to you.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
...but, you know, you can choose not to believe that either, and just call people morons if they don't agree with you. I don't take it personally.

      Well, yes, people are different.  People saying that penis size matters won't affect me at all, or that all the cool kids drink.  But certain things will.  Maybe you would laugh about the dead mother thing because it doesn't apply to you.  Your mother isn't dead.  But if I knew that, and I said it to you anyway precisely just to hurt you, I think you will probably be quite upset.  You may count to ten.  You may walk away.  You may handle it like a champ, and that's good.  That is something you should do.  But it's not something you ought to do.  I ought not to have insulted your mother just to hurt you.  And even if you handle it like a champ, I really doubt that there was no initial emotional reaction.  There is no prompt asking "[insult]Do you want to become angry?  y/n".  It's more like "[insult>you are angry] Do you want to dwell on this?  y/n".  These things are automatic.  Not everybody is the same. <br/> 
It's like going to a arachnophobic convention, unleashing a bunch of spiders, and blaming them for panicking.  They should go to therapy and learn how to deal with spiders, but they have no moral responsibility to, and therefore they don't deserve blame for feeling the way they feel.  It is your moral responsibility to recognize the consequences of your actions.   <br/> 
You will say that these people have psychological disorders, therefore they do not count.  But we all have initial emotional responses about things, most of which are automatic.  What makes it a disorder is if it will greatly affect their life negatively and if it's out of the norm.  Taking advantage of people's psychological weaknesses is just douchey, and unfair.  They have to undergo a lot of work just to be normal.

No, you're really not getting it. No matter what you say, I have a choice to let it affect me or not. You cannot MAKE me feel insulted. I choose to feel insulted, if I place any weight on the words that come out of your mouth. But since I don't take ANYTHING you say personally (good or bad), it doesn't affect me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It might be too radical of a concept for you to grasp, but it's true. There's a good book on this topic called 'The Four Agreements'. You might want to check it out, just for some balance.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm curious why you're going into psychology if you think that we have no control ever over our emotional reactions. If we never have any choice, if we can never actually create our own realities, how do we change as people? How do we achieve what we want? You're not making much sense, honestly. It sounds like a bunch of "I'm in the middle of getting a degree" babble, honestly.

      We have control over our actions, not our emotions.  Our actions can kinda control your emotions, like taking a deep breath, not getting arguments you know will make you upset, picturing a meadow in your head, etc.  You can get counseling so that certain things won't bother you in the future.  All I'm saying is that when a stimulus is presented, you have your initial emotional reaction, and then you can indirectly control it by making yourself think certain thoughts and do certain actions.  An initial emotional reaction comes instantly, before you are able to think it over.  It is an unconscious thing.  Does that make sense to you?  I'm trying to be clear =/

      While a black man who may be hurt by the N word shouldn't go into a racist area if he wants to avoid it, that doesn't mean that the racists are off the hook for calling him that.  A person should be able to experience the world how any other person should.  The black man shouldn't go into the racist area, but the racists oughtn't to be racist.  Or maybe you will argue that the black man is irrational for being offended by this word.

      I say sir, but is it perhaps not unwise to be revealing a young lady's all in such plain sight? Was there not a bit of consternation the last time I did such a thing that perhaps such depictions ought to be placed behind such as a link perhaps? I mean, true we enjoy our fair share of the rock-hard cat cock from time to time, perhaps in the heated tub, but some find it to be a bit of a bother to have it showing up while at work.

      A fair and valid statement, true, but after being scolded the last time I posted something along those lines I was presented with the dilemma of trying to choose this time. I felt it better to err on the side of caution. Perhaps we ought to all agree on a set of general rules for what we feel must be shrouded and what may be allowed to caper across our eyes freely and without fetters.

      A 5 star hotel where?  Because that is a bad policy, to assume a woman is married.  I'm sure there are a lot of spinsters who are very sensitive about it, and assuming that she is married may make her feel worse for it.   <br/> 
Ms can refer to a married or unmarried woman.  If she is married, she'll correct you, and no one's feelings will be hurt.

      Allow me to agree with SJE. That is a completely insane policy. I know I would personally be pissed if my girlfriend was ever referred to as "Mrs.". Like, seriously pissed to the degree that I'd probably complain to the management and take my business elsewhere. Even worse if she was referred to by my name. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I was somehow forced to marry someone I would never allow them to take my name. It is my name, not theirs. They cannot have it. I would find it intensely creepy if someone actually wanted to do that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh and SJE, if this is not one of those times when you are trying to be a jerk ironically I think you might want to rethink that. It's not generally an issue of making "spinsters" feeling worse so much as, well, far more complex issues involving a woman's identity being defined by her marital status and her relation to a man. Part of which is also how men are referred to by a fairly neutral honorific, but women, under this system, are not. There are a lot of personal and political feelings going on here and it's best to steer clear of that because anything other than a neutral honorific will offend a wide variety of people in an almost equally wide number of ways.

Thus the correct address should have been "Ms. Head"

      I'm not sure the term "spinster" is in any way politically or socially correct. Just FYI, in case you're not aware of that. If you're just being a cock to lady strangers, ok, but it would be tragic if you were using the term without knowing the weight of the baggage behind it.

Perhaps I am just needlessly bitter since it was only recently that I found that it was not, as I had long suspected, some sort of program that incorporated twirling about until becoming dizzy, but in some sort of aerobic context. After step aerobics and those silly balls that remind me of the things you'd ride on as a child I'm prepared to believe in just about anything.

      ... seriously? your example was "he gypped me out of my money" and what you thought was offensive was the HE? Don't you know gyp is racist against gypsies, who you probably shouldn't call gypsies either. The gadjo have decide to call them Romany, which isn't necessarily valid either. My point is: don't say you'll never do something again while doing it again.

      If you really get offended at "gyp," you need to reprioritize, my friend. There are far viler things out there to preach about. <br/>

And since you're just getting started (unless you're AIU) let me give you a pointer - start off by saying some funny shit. Make us happy that you're here.  <em>Then</em>  you can start nitpicking veteran posters about their use of laughably inoffensive racial slurs. <br/>

      Seventy years from now, the Pulitzer Prize for Literature will be awarded to an unknown person known only by his handle "gladdi8orrex" a few hours after William Logan Waltheimer succumbs to his year-long struggle with skin cancer.  William has spent his entire lifetime a confused and scared soul, insulting others over the Internet, too afraid to go into the outside world, where others will laugh at him for his perceived lack of intelligence.  Indeed, he was a late bloomer, not learning how to spell properly until his twentieth year, but he had shown an uncanny ability with words, beginning with online "rap battles", quite popular during the turn of the millenium with which he completely destroyed his opponent, and slowly honing his skills to become known perhaps the greatest writer and thinker of the century.  Never having written a book or short story proper, all of his work was comprised of crude stories and insults written on commenting systems, beginning with the then obscure Assetbar(which later grew larger than Facebook itself) account for the comic Achewood.  His scribblings around the internet were like graffiti, heavily buried under other comments and soon forgotten.  Fleeting, insignificant.  It was not until the 2050s was his work discovered and fully translated when he was recognized as the greatest craftsman of the English language since Shakespeare, evoking the emotion and despair of Kafka, and weaving words like Joyce.  Always a controversial figure, there was much debate who this man could be.  Some thought he was popular writers of the day who did not wish to sully their reputation, and others thought that he was a collection of individuals.  But whoever penned the enigmatic utterances of genius is not important.  What is important is the change in human condition he brought about, drastically changing the English language itself.  But the time he found recognition--the one thing this tortured soul was looking for--William had been suffering from a psychotic breakdown, a fact that would not be surprising to any gladdi8orrexian scholar.   <br/> 
William spent the rest of his life laughing mindlessly at holovision, kept alive by a steady diet of heart medicine, pain killers, antidepressants, and sedatives.   <br/> 
The last thought gladdi as he slowly passed into the ether was of his old friends, the only people he percieved who accepted him as a human being, the original Assetbarbarians, holding their hands out, faces beaming with pride and support, telling him that he is accepted, he is important.  He is loved. <br/>

      The  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110102224719/https://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=boner">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>  states this particular usage as 1912 and, as I presumed, that it was in reference to the slang term "bone-headed". <br/> 
 <br/> 
The same source actually cites the 1950s as the time when it began to take on its more commonly used current slang meaning. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The human penis, of course, lacks an actual bone though most other mammals -- the whale, perhaps, being the most well-known -- possess a bone known as a  <strong>baculum</strong> . <br/> 
 <br/>

These bacculi come from river otters. Like Phillipe. That is what his dick bone looks like. Now you know.

      Not that I don't believe you, but I'd like a reference for this. I couldn't exactly recall, but he seemed more like a river otter to me so I went with it. <br/>

      Actually, that seems like pretty unfounded conjecture. During the transfer station arc, he seems entirely unwilling to swim in the sea, but slides down the bank of a river in a way which is apparently quite instinctual.  <br/>

      The response to that would have been "No shit, Sherlock."  <br/> 
Boner was contextual slang. It could mean 'bonehead move' in one instance, 'hard-on' in another. <br/> 
 Also, there was a curious phenomenon best described as "cultural frowning and censorship", so that made bonerisms more fun for comic-book artists.  <br/> 
 In fact, I seem to recall a paperback book named something like Boners and Spoonerisms about famous social blunders.

      the cats are wasteful and extravagant in many ways. it is because of little nephew that this family is described as polyprofligates. i haven't cared much for this arc, but i sure have been googling and wikipediaing a lot lately so i can come close to understanding what the fuck onstad is trying to say, and i most of the time appreciate such mental exercise.  <br/>

still though, 'bozazzles the ganoggin'? urbandictionary knows nothing. i live about 20 miles from ray's house and i've never heard that kind of stuff. out of touch with stoner cat culture, i guess. or, onstad lost touch with stonder cat bay area culture when he moved.

      This is going to sound harsh, but if you actually felt the need to look up what 'bozzazzles the ganoggin' means and not just infer that it's a made-up expression and deduce its meaning from the context, I honestly don't know which comic you've been reading all this time - 'cause it wasn't achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Achewood invents approximately eight cubic metres of made-up slang per hour. You could only successfully look up about 15% of the slang terms used. What the heck is bozazzling your ganoggin' young man?

      Doesn't sound harsh at all. Achewood has plenty of made up words, but it also has plenty of words that are real that I'd never encountered before. Example: polyprofligates.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only difference between made-up slang and real words is how often they are used. 'W00t' is in dictionaries now, for fuck's sake. 'Santorum' was a made up word that has also gained acceptance. Language evolves and changes constantly, and no one person can keep up with it. The last few strips have been almost nonsensical to me and the only way I can tell if Onstad is using real words or making them up is to look up the words.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe some people are better at guessing the meaning of words in context than others. I never got very far in Finnegan's Wake, for example.

      You see now, I look at this picture and think.  I don't know who that guy is, but clearly he is/was rock to the bone, and hoped you didn't like it.  He is the other side of that old saw from Pulp Fiction: Elvis or  The Beatles.  Cause Elvis wasn't all that.  Sorry, but he wasn't.  I mean, he could sing and all, he had a great voice, but he was no more "core" than Paul.  It's a fake dichotomy, just like all the others we delude ourselves with these shaggy days.

      I see that you watched the deleted scenes. <br/> 
Yeah, that dichotomy bugged me too, but mostly because almost no one is going to pick Elvis.  I don't know about the mid 90s, but no one in the late 2000s listens to that guy, but people are still listening to the Beatles.   <br/> 
Same with Rolling Stones and Beatles.  It'd be closer, but the Fab Four will always beat them out.  But it's still the same type of music.  Not much of a difference.

      Well, there is difference, but they are both classic rock/pop from the 60s.  The average person who likes classic rock from the 60s will most likely like the Beatles more than the Stones, (but of course they will like the stones).

      It's hard to imagine what present popular music would be like without Elvis and the Beatles. They both represented sea-changes in the genre. As good as the stones have been over the years I don't think the present scene would be much different if they had not been around.

      The thing about Elvis is that he brought R&B to the white audience. Previously it had been considered "black" music and was only available on black record labels and radio stations.  <br/> 
Similarly the Beatles with their tight deceptively complex arrangements and (usually) seemed to me to fuse the best elements of r&b and 50s pop into something new. <br/> 
Elvis was a sensation at the time and made a lot of money - enough to kill him anyway, but of course the 4 will be known and played for much longer. <br/> 
I'm reminded of Onstad's Buxtehude/JSB thing. I can't remember if it was a stip or a blog. <br/>

      God I loath the Beatles. I just found out one of the guys I work with hates the Beatles too. I feel so uplifted. I would much rather listen to Elvis than them, but would really prefer Little Richard or Screamin' Jay Hawkins. While I do prefer the Stones over the drab four, my favorite Stones song is the 12" version of Miss You, so I don't think I am a typical Stones fan.
