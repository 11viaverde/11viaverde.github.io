      That story itself is pretty good, but most of the other stories in the book are just as good if not better (personal favorites so far: "Good Country People" and "A Stroke of Good Fortune").  It's pretty standard O'Connor: some kind of Catholic undertones re: fall from grace, sometimes redemption, etc.  I don't know.  I was just saying "You damn well better know who she is because she's the proverbial shit."

      That idea of the grotesque certainly does figure into at least Achewood (of Ware, I've only read "Jimmy Corrigan," which just seems more depressing, though it's possibly more "grotesque" in Jimmy's daydreams).  The rural elements of Achewood--Nice Pete, any kind of low-class dude in the GOF or Beef's childhood etc--definitely seem, now that I think of it, to kind of call back to that idea, "Southern" or otherwise.

      Facebook is way more toxic to the intellect.  Way, way, more.  The comments on Youtube are so stupid that it like they are not even water soluble. If the poison won't dissolve, it won't get into your system, and is thus harmless.  Facebook though?  Hell of carcasses all over the place.  "Suzy has just made Capo in Mafia Wars."

      This is the devil speaking.  He is telling lies to make you feel bad that your penix is less than ten inches.  It doesn't matter how big it is (as long as it's bigger than 7), women will not achieve climax.  It is a myth.  They use it to control you.

      I wager that Youtube will be the womb of Skynet. The standards of the Turing Test are substantially lower in that environment. The US government could easily write a script that made racist, conspiracy laden comments only tangentially related to the discussion at hand, you filthy crackers.

      East 17 are an English pop boy band formed in 1992. The group achieved 18 Top 20 singles and four Top 10 albums and were one of the famous boy bands along with Take That from the United Kingdom during the early to mid 1990s. They occasionally blended rap and pop in songs such as "House of Love", "Steam" and "Let It Rain", attaining popularity as a result of concurrent appeal to demographics of both fags and niggers.

      If by 'the crumbling of civilization' you mean 'all the inane bullshit people waste their time doing on the internet' - There will always be idiocy on the internet... before the internet there was idiocy too, but it was less accessible. Onstad's just using the medium of the age. Because he's self-publishing online, he gets to write exactly what he wants, with whatever frequency suits him, and without answering to an editor. Bill Watterson and Gary Larson might well have been publishing a century ago for how different the arena is now. Onstad's giving something awesome to the world, and the internet happens to be the most effective way to do it.

      Chris Onstad, take it back!  The internet is mankind's collective, most perfect Id, and for that we have to love it, respect it, and cherish it.  Never mock it, no matter what it shows you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, without the internet, I'd never know how much I love Ariel (human form) with inflated breasts and calves, or that to study insemination in the Early Days some scientist would put male frogs in little rubber trousers before they got it on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I'd never have written the Ariel/Frog fan-fiction that resulted in the learning of that factoid! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is that the sort of future you want for your children?  Is that the sort of past you sigh for?  <br/>

has anyone else noticed the apparent absence of aiu? everybody is being really nice to one another, no long, rambling posts. (gladi has special dispensation.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
do trolls have vacations like real people or has someone taken up that contract at last? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, it's good to see a number of new posters, even some of the old regulars have popped their heads above the parapet, and the return of short witty good natured posts. <br/>

      I only read your post by chance;  I'm only reading like 5% of the posts anymore.  I been rather busy in my personal life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
also, another thing, is I started hanging out on the pay side of assetbar, and I also started hanging out on TOUAMB, and those both take up time.  I have a project to troll the pay side of assetbar, but it will have to wait until I have more time, so for now I'm much less involved in online hanging out in general. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And finally, I have been upstaged.  It's bad enough that this tremendous opportunity to troll presents it's self without any way to get there. (airport in disarray, seaport smashed, roads impassable)  That's bad enough.  Adding insult to injury, kicking me while I'm down, Pat Robertson exhibits a master stroke of genius and manages to take credit for one of the greatest trolls ever.  And all the media gives him coverage.  What has PAt Robertson done that's so original I ask.  What has he said that I haven't said 10 times over, and worse?  Dude is plainly channeling me.  I'm the best.  I'm the worst.  Pay attention to meeeee.  Not him, meeee...  I'm the droid you're looking for.  I'm Satan incarnate.  Me, not him, me! me! me!

      fuck you.  everyone has issues, asshole.  everyone, including your mother.  IF you wanted to share with us your sense of superiority, your sense that someone else's issues are misplaced, misguided, or whatever, you needn't have bothered.  Your being an arrogant prick is in no way original and I think I speak for the majority of people when I say that we are probably not fastidiously counting every last prick in the world.  So shut your mouth until you have something new and different to contribute to the world.  If you don't have anything more to contribute to the world than random expressions of egocentrism and condescension then maybe you should find and swallow the contents of a large bottle of sleeping pills, preferably on an empty stomach.   <br/> <br/> <br/>

Either he just now got into Achewood and loves it enough to start commenting immediately, or he's been reading for years and just created an account and could not be bothered to sit at his computer clicking through the whole archive in order to earn the street cred of being a connoisseur.
