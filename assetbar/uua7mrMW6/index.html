You've got 684 comments spanning two years time.  By now you should have ignored Gladi8orrex or just stopped taking him seriously.  I think he's just doing character studies or something.  He might be a professional actor.  He's kind of like a standup comic.  Only it's a sort of comedy noir.  He's like a balck standup comediam.  Nigger's aight. <br/>

      Glad is right regarding some women.  My ex graduated second in her class from college but worked as a "struggling artist" not making enough to even have to file an income tax return.  Meanwhile she got 1,600 a month from me (tax free).  And my kid is underfed and has no new clothing. <br/>

      Hmm, never looked it up before, but "apostrophe" comes straight from ancient Greek and means "turning away."  This led to it being the name for leaving something out as well.  Strange word.  Reminds of parentheses.  Who came up with these?!

      I've actually long thought about birth control options and vasectomies for animals. It just seems sort of cruel to castrate them in order to control the pet population. Why not find a safe way to let them get their bone on without the babies? <br/>

In all fairness trying to get a cat to wear a condom sounds hilariously difficult. I still say that there has to be a better way.

      I don't know about other animals but in cats birth control is only one reason but neutering because it helps to control sex-related behavior like aggression, spraying and marking with urine and generally yowling and screaming for no particular reason.  It depends on the cat but some cats will be really troublesome to keep as pets unless they are spayed or neutered.

      With female animals, it also prevents a horrible horrible disease known as pyometra, in which the animal's uterus is full of pus. <br/>

Also, neutering/spaying is not done by assholes, it is done by responsible pet owners who don't contribute to the overcrowded shelter situation and pump out badly-bred and useless purserats like shit-head backyard breeders do. <br/>

I understand the need for animal birth control, I just keep wondering if there isn't a better route than castration.

      no seriously he was saying just because someone or some cat is an asshole, should you cut their nuts off? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it depends on your circumstances.  if you are able to provide for your female cat and it's offspring, or if you are able to keep your male cat from going around impregnating random female cats, then there is no need to sterilize it.  by 'provide' for, I mean, you are able to keep it, and your estate is able to pay for it's upkeep in the event of your demise, and your will instructs this.  otherwise, if you die in a car crash, and your cat isn't sterilized, it is much less likely to find someone who wants to keep it, and more likely to get put down. <br/> 
 <br/> 
also there is the fact that if you cat is not sterilized, it is more likely to try to get out of the house, and if it gets out, it may get lost, and again, when shelters find random cats, they find it much easier to find homes for those who are sterilized than not.

      Once again, I apologize for my lack of clarity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I definitely think that it is acceptable to cut a person's sack off because they're an asshole. Just not that of a cat or dog. I guess I could try to defend this by saying that people have the capability to be reasoned with while animals have less ability to understand the problems with their behavior, but that would be a lie. <br/> 
 <br/> 
More importantly though I want it to be understood that I think animals should be sterilized. I also think most people should probably be sterilized*. Again, this is partly a joke, but I've often wondered why people decided that just castrating an animal was the easiest, best method rather than trying to adapt with the times and technology and find ways that animals can safely have non-procreative sex. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*I'm only half-joking here too. I'd really like there to be some strong social pressure that anyone who has more than one or two children is a terrible, monstrous person in much the same way as child molesters are typically thought of. We need our global population to decrease, not keep increasing.

      There really isn't a better route, though.  I mean I guess you could try to feed some kind of oral contraceptive to your pets, but that wouldn't really solve any kind of issues with cancer of the ladyparts in your female animals, and castration is one of the most important ways of preventing aggression in male dogs (and since Nancy Grace and her ilk exist, the more ways we can cut down on OMGtehviciouspitbullz!! garbage, the better). <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I guess no, there isn't a better way.  There are infinitely more benefits to total castration than there would be to some kind of doggy condom or pill.

      Castration in humans would probably cut down heavily on aggression in our own more dickish members, but I don't think most people regard it as a reasonable means of solving these problems. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem, for me at least, with pit bulls isn't that they're vicious (it has little to do with breed and a lot to do with the owner, upbringing, training, mistreatment, and cues to attack), but that they're simply ugly. Almost as bad as the hated Labradoodle.

      In all actuality, a well-bred pit bull should NEVER be aggressive toward humans.  The reason they historically made such amazing fighting dogs in the pit is that they were bred with the desire to please their masters SO MUCH that they would tear into another dog to prove it.  It's a result of incredibly stupid breeding (crossing with human-aggressive breeds) that we get those hideous genetic nightmare hippo dogs called "Bullies."  A well-bred pit is really adorable and athletic, and brilliant at sports like weightpull. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And seriously, don't get me started on the whole "designer" dog industry.  It makes me furious to the point of incoherency.   <em>Hurr the shelters are full but lets purposely pump out mutts left and right becuz theyre ~So KeWt~ and we wont test for genetic diseases becuz only evil nasty purebreds have those blah blah hybrid vigor lol</em> <br/>

      On top of that: <br/> 
If you don't sterilise your male cat, be prepared for your house to stink. <br/> 
If you don't sterilise your female cat, be prepared for it to REALLY stink when she has kittens. <br/> 
Also, it can stop them from getting kitty-AIDS by one route (they can still get it in a fight). But rumour has it sterilisation also stops fighting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(However, do not sterilise male dogs too soon. It seems to make them utterly stupid. And if you need a fit dog (e.g. for racing or shows) then don't do it because they get fat really easily. <br/> 
I have also been told that female cats and dogs should ideally have at least one litter before they're spayed, otherwise they have a tendency to be bad-tempered. Whether this is true or not I do not know.)

I always wondered why barbershops used to sell condoms. Perhaps it was for advertising purposes? <br/>

OTOH, the spirlaing red-striped barber's pole is supposed to represent an amputated limb (barbers being one business in town sure to have sharp, clean blades), so it may not be the best design to roll over one's cock, if symbolism is a big thing in one's life...

      Barbers very rarely performed amputation as such a complicated procedure was best reserved for an actual doctor, but they were in charge of most minor surgeries, as well as all oral surgery. And by the time the barbers were working, most civilized people had abandoned the idea of blood-letting as a useful medical technique. And also, the red stripe doesn't just represent the blood, it was originally created by wrapping blood soaked gauze around a lamp post. <br/>

      Actually, barbers were cutting, trimming and pulling long before blood-letting had been abandoned. Indeed, bleeding persisted for some time, despite the widespread desertion of the humouristic theory attributable to Galen, Ibn Sina etc. in the 19th century. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As far as I can remember, barbers are still required to hold a license? I believe this is (to some degree, at least) a hold-over from the old days of barber-surgery. <br/> <br/> <br/> <em>I wonder what Pat thinks of barbers practicing surgery?</em>

      If I could go to a fancy salon that was giving me a foot soak pedicure that doubled as a dentist it might make me less scared of them.  I enjoy this getting oral surgery from a barber. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now that I think of it my father got out of Veit Nam and used his VA money to become a beautician.  Not only did old ladies get perms from him, exotic performers get nipple piercings, but his friends required tooth pullings from him more often than not.  He kept Bud's tooth as a necklace.  I still have to take my wisdom teeth to the jeweler to give him one as a present.

      I can see it. There's a very masculine vibe to a proper barbershop of the old school. All getting a shave with a straight razor, a splash of house-made tonic, chatting with a dude of men. More like a gentleman's gentleman for those without the means to support a personal valet. He knows of your needs and can, in a polite and discreetly knowing manner, suggest that perhaps you might be in need of certain items that could be of use to gentleman who cares for his female companion's well-being. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the same way the barber is always a dude of years. You never see a young guy as a barber. Oh sure, he might work at the shop, perhaps a nephew or an apprentice, but he's just a guy learning the trade who might cut your hair. He's never the barber. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Old-school barber is class all the damn way. He is the man who knows and his is the advice you should seek. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This, I suspect, is where Pat's hatred comes from. Barbers know just by lookin' at him exactly what his score is. The doesn't hate them for being so much as for knowin'. The person he really hates is [i]himself.[i]

      Yeah, man. In my hometown there is an old-school barbershop that I went to as a kid. The main barber has a killer handlebar mustache, and there's Iditarod posters on the wall and pictures of guys next to dead elks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I went back after years, and damn if those guys didn't give me the best haircut and beard trim I've had since ... since I left I guess. (Although I didn't have a beard back in the day.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I lived in D.C. over the summer, and I had the opportunity to go to a for reals black dude barbershop. Y'know, like in Barbershop. It was just dudes straight-up dissing on each other for 45 minutes straight. It was thing of beauty. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've come to the conclusion that barbers and cabbies are the modern day philosophers.

      Well, it's clearly a thing. Is not the hair salon often seen as a similar place of ladies? All gossip and chattering as much as getting a pedicure or a permanent? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I must say that I somewhat miss this sort of thing. Not only because it's gone, but because I don't cut my hair and have a beard. I never liked going to the barber and always say it as tedious and highly unpleasant. Maybe it's because times had changed away from what I truly needed and, in a primal way, I was dissatisfied.

      Old-school barber is where you will find Cornelius. Lyle cuts his own under a bowl, and Todd trims the back. Mr Gigi does Ray's hair (the non-diming part).

The typical robust solution is to include a client-specific value as a hidden form parameter in every place that might legitimately call the URL, and then reject requests that don't contain that value.  Google "CSRF" for more info.  OWASP has a good discussion of the topic.

      That's exactly what's happened here, except that the action being forged doesn't normally originate from a GET form, it simply originates from a hard-wired link (the 'jeer' link) which of course for these purposes is identical to a GET form. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The example in this wikipedia article is pretty much spot on as to what's happening: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110224024024/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSRF">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSRF</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
premium assetbar exists on the web site s.assetbar.com <br/> 
regular assetbar exists on m.assetbar.com.  The two message boards are completely separate, with separate cookies, accounts, authentications, etc.  The inline image references on the 'm' board are initiating actions on the 's' board. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The wikipedia article provides an example that relies on such ridiculous naivete on the part of the programmer --  I'm really amazed to find a real-world instance of such a silly example, RIGHT HERE on my favorite web comic!

      no it doesn't matter, but neither does a game of chess or challenging yourself to run a marathon.  People do these things just for the challenge and to engage the mind in puzzle solving. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I don't expect others to feel that this puzzle solving, aka 'hacking,' is anything special, rather, I expect them to vicariously enjoy the use of this hacking for the purpose of trolling the other assetbar users.  It can be entertaining if you're in the right mindset.  It might be funny because it disrupts the normal routine of things, kind of like a big muscular man with a huge adam's apple cross dressing, or a guy wearing a suit that's two sizes too big or small.  A lot of people won't find it funny, and some people will be downright offended by it.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Merely the fact of taking something seriously which is obviously of no import could be what is funny about it.  It could be lots of things.  I can't pretend that I have it all thought out and I know exactly what I'm doing or even that I even know why some people laugh when they do.  I merely intuitively follow my nose in a search for the absurd and the weird.  I admit that part of that intuition is to deliberately try things which I know will be annoying and will cause offense.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But if you're looking for rhyme or reason or motive, eh, it's a whole combination of factors.  I just don't think that it's accurate to say, however, that my trolling is good or bad.  It's simultaneously both and neither.  I mean what do you want, white picket fences, an environment that is perfectly ordered, with everyone following the same system of ethics and morals, and with such systems being arranged so as to never have any inherent contradictions and paradoxes?

      When you're just about the only one who finds it funny and everyone else sees it as disruptive, unpleasant, and unwelcome it's a problem. You can't just walk up to a stranger and punch them in the back of the head saying "HAHA! Look at this deliciously absurd and unexpected physical comedy! Didn't that upset your expectations of the day in a novel and amusing manner?", people just find it to be the action of an asshole who doesn't value the very reasonable constraints that allow people to co-exist in society. <br/>

This isn't some sort of Andy Kaufman shit where when people figure out the joke they can appreciate how funny it is. When you're intentionally starting fights, impeding usability, and trying to break the site you're just being a jerk.

      You stand at the collapsed but navigable entrance of the Ruins of Cylene.  Once a thriving capital, the heart of an ancient and magical civilization, but is now the crumbling,  moss-covered haunt of dripping beasts, corrupted men, and untold riches.

      A little girl witch with a big frilly hat stumbles out of the forest, waving a wand with a big cardboard star and tassels at end of it.  Both the star and the tassels are covered in sequins. <br/>

      The party, spurred to action by the calls to violence of a little girl, charges into the jungle, led only by the random pointings of her cardboard wand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After a few hours of hacking undergrowth and wading through wastedeep muck, the group arrives at a small shack on a patch of dry land deep in the jungle.  Angela Lansbury, dressed like the teapot from Beauty and the Beast, steps out of the shack and waves her arm in a dismissive fashion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
With a twinkle and a hint of the smell of peppermint, the party finds itself back in front of the city gates.  One cleric towards the back, however, was reconstituted incorrectly and finds his intestines spilling out onto the ground in splatting coils of gore.  He asks for assistance.

      My half-elven thief will attempt to climb the mountain of rubble, he has a climbing harness, 30' of stout hemp rope, Rope Use non-weapon proficiency, and has rolled a 76 on his Climb Walls ability. <br/> 
 <br/> 
His grey eyes sparkle as he sees the obstacle, finally a chance to shine and prove his worth to the party after that disastrous incident with the fireball trap. He could have sworn it was fully disarmed when he let the cleric open it, but even now he is tormented by doubt. Was it beyond his ability? Was it really as simple as he thought, but he is a failure and a fraud? He is no half-breed fuck-up as his master said those many years ago. He will show them all. This wall will prove everything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps the pretty young redheaded druid will finally see that he is a competent, virile male and have a roll in the hay with him. She seems to flirt with everyone, but so far his clumsy efforts have yielded nothing but lonely nights around the fire listening again to Rothgar's stories of the great war against the Gnolls.

      You adjust all your straps, count your grommets, linchpins, and carabiners and set to the rubble pile.  After a morning's hard work, you crest the top of the pile, panting and exhausted.  You find the rest of the party, in a circle round a campfire cleaning up the last of lunch. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Oh, jeez, sorry man, we didn't even notice you were gone.  Did you...did you just scale this pile?  There was a crude staircase that we all went up." <br/>

Looking to your left you spot a gentle slope down to the ground. <br/>

A few yards away, Rothgar feeds dried figs to a coquettish red-headed druid. <br/>

      I check the remains of lunch for traps and look for a safe way down to the city.  <br/>

Assuming there is time left before we depart I will also roll a Lore check, an Ancient History check, a Local History check, and consult the copy of "Allow Us to Depart: Crumbling Ruins of Cylene" that I purchased before the journey.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hopefully there is a well-regarded establishment where we might procure some tapas for a reasonable sum. Also a hostel where we can bed down for the night and get drunk with uninhibited students from the Northlands who will lecture us on our foreign policy, criminal subjugation of the hillfolk, and perhaps tug us off.

      You  <em>detected</em>  no traps in the lunch garbage.  Travel rations are, however, full of preservatives and a high-sodium diet is a silent killer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Consulting your assorted books you realize that there will be no quarter given to you in the city of Cylene as it has been deserted by civilized men for a dozen centuries.  Any respite you seek, you seek at your own peril. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once the proud heart of the greatest civilization of antiquity, Cylene is legendary now for the depth of magical detritus it holds, monster and treasure alike. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The city is bisected by two grand canals, now brackish and impenetrable, teeming with Tehlu knows what.  Small tributary canals connect the rest of the city to the main canals.  Between the canals run wide streets littered with shattered monuments and statuary, chunks of edifice and the remnants of a commercial society in full swing before the mysterious Catastrophe of Cylene destroyed it in an instant.  Dark alleys and windows await you.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Silver Temple was known to be the haunt of the old high mages and the repository of their knowledge, but no one knows where in the city it might be as most who venture here are lost without a trace. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In your party there are a few Northlanders in your party who are already drunk, though it is only just two in the afternoon.  Off on their own, the red-haired druid is already tugging off Rothgar beneath his tunic.  In front of everybody, like they can't figure out what is going on.

      I fire half a dozen arrows off into the city below at random and then listen intently to see if they appear to have stirred anything up (Detect Noise check: 64). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Assuming nothing of interest is heard I will attempt to survey the city with my spyglass for any obvious points of interest. Finding any I shall notify the party and seek to move down into the city hiding in shadows (39) and moving silently (11) as I do so. I will advise the party to please refrain from tramping loudly behind me, chatting to each other in a boisterous fashion, and calling out to me by name to see what Jarl, Son of Lothar just did. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As usual I will make a special effort to seek out any erotic art, especially those in which a rather saucy lady is about to be struck upon the buttocks as Q'Nayl often seems willing to pay slightly more for those. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I shall inform Rothgar about the potential to encounter gnolls and hope that his racial bloodlust will be enough to occupy him while I inquire if fair Yssandryl might have a need for any sort of  <em>backstabbing</em> .

      some guys get non-horny the nano-second that they cum and start thinking about doing dishes and similar chores, but for me the party is just getting started and the first thing I wanna do is eat my cum out of the condom.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've had varying reactions to this from different girls over the years.  I've found that if the girl says in advance that she is cool with it is absolutely no predictor of how she will react when I actually go ahead and do it, so I've learned that it's best not to check with them before hand, instead just go ahead and do it, and if they freak out, oh well, it wasn't meant to be.  I've had some girlfriends who I thought would be cool with it who were totally square about it, and others who I suspected were way too uptight but turned out to be totally nacholaunt about it.  So, *shrug.* <br/> 
 <br/> 
By far the worst experience I've had, sex wise, however, not counting any sort of vernerial diseases discovered after the fact, anyway, was this one time right at about the same time I came the damn condom was just about totally slipping off.  It was a brand of condom I don't normally buy, right, because I couldn't find the kind that fits me best, so anyway, I sort of suspected it was coming off, but in the whole extasy of the moment sort of thing I was just like 'fuck it' you know, so the damn condom comes off inside this girl, and I'm not even sure how much of cum if any actually made it into the condom either, and I was getting totally worked up you know because I like to eat the cum after I cum, and I was really looking forward to that, so I say to the girl, hey, don't move, I got to pull it out, but before I could say anything she was running into the shower to douche with a bottle of spermacide, and I just lost it you know, and I started swearing and throwing things, and then I was like 'the least you can let me do is shoot the spemacide inside you with my mouth and catch it as it falls out again and douche you that way, but she wasn't down with that, she she wasn't "in the mood" anymore, whatever that fucking means!  So anyway.  I didn't call her again after that. <br/>

      are you... not socializing enough?  What do you do for work?  Maybe you need to move to some place where there are more people who are of your mindset?  Not that there is any particular need to get laid, but, there is a general sort of need to have social relations, and, generally, social relationships tend to translate into getting laid, so the fact that you haven't gotten laid indicates that at least possibly you aren't socializing enough with the right people.   just wondering

      I think people should stop giving sex toys as gag gifts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When one of my best ladyfriends in high school turned 18, a mutually-shared male friend called me in the dead of night.  He sez, "We gotta get ____ a gift!  Her birthday is tomorrow! I am going to pick you up!"  So I sez, "okay". <br/> 
 <br/> 
Prior to this, we had all been making jokes about getting her sex-based stuff, but really  <em>hilarious</em>  sex items like facsimiles of dolphin dongs or anything Japanese. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This guy, we'll call him Keith, when he gets to my house he's very quiet...fishy.  So, we're on our way to the local area sex store, with stony silence our only companion--outside of each other, but that was almost too awkward to comprehend.  I think once I got in the car, we both realized that we just looked like a couple.   <br/> 
Long story short, we get to the place--one guy working--and head straight to the...lady's novelties.  I'm looking for giant  <em>'hilarious'</em>  detachable penises, and Keith shoots every single one of my suggestions down: "She'll never use that!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"...are we getting her a utilitarian sex toy or a gag gift" <br/> 
"I don't want to waste my money on something that is just for laughs." <br/> 
 <br/> 
So we got her this like, beginner's sex toy set with tiny vibrators and a wee little dongus, and the next day gave it to her in the brown sack it came in while we loitered in the parking lot of a Don Pablo's. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It wasn't a very good gag gift.

      I got to upper half nudity with my first girlfriend at age 12. It actually wasn't that awkward, but I think it could only move up from our first kiss. <br/>

We were walking up a staircase, and I was one step below her so we were about the same height (she was probably one inch above me, lip-wise.) It was just kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing and we both leaned in. Mouths touched. Sparks flew. At that very moment, I knew it was true love and that we would never, ever, EVER seperate. At that same moment, she knew that she was falling over her. <br/>

This story also takes on a slightly weirder edge because of differences in educational systems. In the US primary school is grades Kindergarten-5th (i.e. first 6 years of formal schooling) generally with a few schools going up to 6th. I was a tad bit younger, but it's fairly common to be 10 in 5th grade. So rather than a slightly more understandable (but still rather uncommon) middle schooler where if someone goes so far as to get a handjob everyone they know will be talking about it for the next year the talk of primary school children made it feel more like decidedly pre-pubescent kids getting their bones on.

      Primary School here goes up to 13 years old, then secondary school to 18. Last year of primary school is called year 8, so I guess it's like 8th grade, or maybe 7th because we start at 5 years old.

      They make a pretty good number of non-latex condoms that aren't made of lambskin. Polyisoprene seems to be the most common, but there's also the Trojan Supra which is microsheer. <br/>

Frankly I've almost never noticed any sort of difference from the various types whenever my girlfriend did exactly as Molly did and we needed to move to a backup plan for a while.

      I thought this one was fine, but no better than fine.  Maybe because its title and alt text are about posting in parts and it takes away from the comic as a thing of its own worth and reduces it to Only Part of an Experiment.  This could make each day or every other day part of a self-contained story that only goes two or three strips, which I'm fond of, and it could bring back the one-offs I love so much and have touted for almost two years on Assetbar.

      The geometry of love is not an equilateral triangle.  That is at best the geometry of a drunken encounter at a college frat party where there's two others and you're fairly sure at least one is the opposite sex. <br/>

I'd say the geometry of love is something along the lines of a hypercube with a hypersphere passing through it, while two hyperbolas watch wistfully in the distance.

      I am not embarrassed to buy condoms, but I am a little leery about buying lubricant. It seems to imply much more extreme acts than I am actually planning.

      The worst is when you're at the sex shop with your partner purchasing a marital aid, lubricant, a package of batteries that will clearly not fit said marital aid, and renting pornography. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even at a fairly cool shop the clerk still knows exactly what's going down. In fact, the cooler shops are even worse because then the clerk has actually sampled the merchandise and is not just some bored, sleazy smut merchant. There is also a much greater chance that she is a cute girl. Do you want to hear a cute female clerk telling you about how great a particular vibrator is?

      I was actually taking a bus through the Castro the other day and based on the ads outside of sex shops was thinking to myself that, based on what I've seen, the dudes in gay porn don't look all that attractive. It's all these big muscular losers or clean-cut all-american sorts. They just look so damn fake and weird. Kinda like the horrible, trashy bimbos in straight porn. <br/>

I mean, I'm sure there's some great alt gay porn out there and amateur stuff and all, but damn am I glad not to have to put up with that stuff. <br/>

      Oh dear me. I cannot brook the uninterested blow job. I worry if she is getting bored, and if I'm taking too long, which only slows things down even more. There's nothing particularly sexy about the top of the girl's head, and if she's making eye contact with you you feel self conscious about your sex-making faces. Receiving sexual pleasure is like being drunk: it's fun on your own and even more fun in company, but you don't want a sober observer.

      Damn, free lube too? That's kinda uncommon. I'm not actually sure what happened in my high school's sex ed class as they let me test out of it. It seems like if most kids are dumb enough to actually need the sorts of basic things they apparently discuss they probably shouldn't ever be having sex. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do, however, support the notion that everyone graduating from high school in this country should be required to pass a course instructing them on how to go down on the gender of their choice at a satisfactory level. The time has come to end shitty head.

      To be fair, without lube you're more likely to end up with a broken condom, especially with anal sex. So it's not that strange, even if it's unusual.

      Damn you kids and your constant anal sex! You're just making the rest of us jealous. It's like these alarmist pieces on girls sending nude cell phone photos to dudes. Back in my day we would have shit ourselves over the possibility of such a thing. I suspect most of these articles come from assholes who just feel jealous. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The bigger problem is really that a ton of places are still using abstinence-only education or are, at the very least, heavily leaning towards such a thing. In far too many places just getting condoms is uncommon enough.

      I hate all the news stories raising a cry about girls "sexting" (does anyone *actually* use that word?). It's just more of the girls-shouldn't-be-sexual bull. The real issue is when people mass-distribute those pictures without the girls' permission, and when that is covered it's still always framed as the girl's fault for sending pictures of herself in the first place, the dirty slut. /rant <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah,  getting schools that don't provide condoms to do so is more important than getting schools that already provide them to provide lube as well. STD testing is also important, and I'm sure even fewer high schools provide that.

      Goodwillgirl has totally caused me to swoon like nothing else*. Dinosaurus Sex Time would be awesome beyond my normal ability to comprehend. <br/>

Sadly, and somewhat embarassingly, I was apparently far too friendly and find myself unable to give her a chubby. I am told it happens to almost everyone fairly often though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would further suggest that in each package of Awesome Condoms you should also probably get a rocket ship, a submarine, a shark, and a giant death ray sufficient to write your name upon the moon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like children's bath toys. Sex time should be fun time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*In my mind she is wearing her apron (likely due to our earlier conversation) with her arms pulled back while growling at the Tyrannosaurus which, oddly, is not actually me, but some sort of vague concept more than anything else. I guess this is good because it easily has the potential to quickly pass from awesome to creepy and that would be a shame.

a world which contains such excellent contraceptives certainly brings with it endless possibility.

      Meh.  I enjoy the act of buying condoms.  Nothing like plopping down a box of the magnums on the counter.  Bonus points if you also buy oddly shaped fruit (such as a potato reminiscent of Our Lord And Savior, or a squash).

      I gotta point out two things, now. 1) Most major stores have those self-checkout machines, enabling one to buy all manner of sensitive items without direct interaction with a clerk. 2) It seems like even after telling us he's trying shorter strips "more often," Onstad is still doing the thing where he creates a self-imposed deadline for the next installment and then continuously postpones. Really, waiting a while for a new Achewood isn't nearly as annoying as being told when to expect one and then it being all not there.

      I'm not so sure it's a good idea for him to break up big strips into smaller installments, because possibly of the overhead associated with posting a strip.  now for a single strip, he's going through deadline pressure twice, he's finalizing and tweaking it twice.  so in the long run, it'll be less strips overall.  I'd rather he just takes his time and does his thing and tells all the complainers to fuck off.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 As far as the annoyance of him not meeting his self-imposed deadlines, that's purely a matter of psychology.  You KNOW he's not good with those deadlines, so technically speaking, you have no excuse for expecting him to meet them. <br/>

      Though I'm used to the self-imposed deadlines not being met, it's still frustrating. I run into the same problem with a housemate of mine, who will say things like "I'll clean up all these huge stacks of useless bullshit on X day" and then never do it. I'd still rather Onstad leave the alleged date of the next comic unsaid.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
My heart's honest desire in regard to Achewood's frequency would really be a return to shorter strips appearing at least three times a week. I've been getting pretty bored with some of the recent long stories as well as the long wait times between installments.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again, I do have a life, and as long as my favorite comic is being updated at all, I'm grateful for that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And lastly, nice dinosaurs. I'm not sure what that picture has to do with anything, but... well, okay.
