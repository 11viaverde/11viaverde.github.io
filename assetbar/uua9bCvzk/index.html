      it all has to do with the sincerity behind the actions i think <br/>

a guy on a harley seems like he's insecure, he's got something to prove <br/>

cornelius has nothing to prove. cornelius just does it <br/>

      As the entire arc proves, being a badass is not necessarily about fucking someone up.  Cornelius is quiet and classy, yet forceful, and the world would be a better place if more people tried to be a badass that way instead of deciding they're just gonna drink and get in fights until nobody can tell what shape their nose was originally.

      My Grandmother used to make Head Cheese. That's right: Put the pig's head in the oven, bake it, and pick off pig lips,  tongue, and whatnot, combine it in some kind of gelatinous mess and call it food. My grandma knew how to do it, but I never ate it. Whenever I see head cheese in the supermarket, though, I think of her, and her badass-head cheese ways.

      Head cheese is a nasty word, dude. Back where I come from (Denmark) this is a much celebrated dish, eaten around Christmas in the main. Although most people have gone from using the head to making it with more convenient cuts of meat. <br/> 
In the Danish recipe, the head is boiled, though. The meat, all tender and tasty as hell, is then peeled off and put in a container with a few bay leaves and other spices. Finally the container is filled to the brim with the broth from the pot. Finally it is refridgerated for some time, letting the juices coagulate into a wonderful, gelatinous mess. It is served with rye bread, pickled red beets, and a strong mustard. It is the food for men.

      The name of this dish, I might add, is "sylte" (which directly translated means "pickle". In Denmark we are so in touch with the swine that we just assume that you mean pickled pig if you don't add a surfix. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also be prepared to use lots of isinglass.
