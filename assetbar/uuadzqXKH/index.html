      My University has three cafetarias.  I was going to one of them when a toothless man wearing a wifebeater came up to me and asked where the cafeteria was.  I asked which one; there are three.  He informed me it was his first day of work and took the shirt he was carrying from over his shoulder and asked "I dunno.  What does this say?" <br/> 
UNH Dining. <br/> 
I led him to the cafetaria I was going to anyways (which is the middle of them) and ate.  Then I walked back to my dorm and I see him again, walking back from another cafetaria.  He recognized me, saying, "Ernt you that kid?" <br/> 
Apparently neither of those cafetarias were the cafetarias he was supposed to start work at today.  So I told him that the third one was all the way across campus, 15 minute walk. <br/> 
"You know what I say I should do?" <br/> 
"What?" <br/> 
"Just say f$#@ it and get drunk at the bar." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kids, learn how to read.

      This is what first and most of second grade were like. Actually, I don't think they evertaught us to read clocks, but luckily it is pretty logical once you realize that the position of the hour hand within a given hour-space is irrelevant.

      Man see. In first grade, we learned to tell time with little drawings of clocks that  <em>completely ignored</em>  that the hour hand moves constantly and not just on the hour. I was a confused little kid for a while, because real-life clocks never had the hand positions the drawings did.

      Yes! That is so true. How the hell do the people making the drawings never think of that, anyhow? I mean, that sort of problem would confuse even adults, much less kids. I always would ask what it meant when the hour hand was in between two numbers and adults had no clue what was wrong with me and I ended up majoring in arts.

      Actually, amusingly enough, it might be because it's hard to draw the hour hand in the right position without screwing it up.  Case in point: Onstad himself put the hour hand way too far around.  It's like past halfway between 5 and 6, but the minute hand is barely over five minutes in!

      In first grade we made paper plate clocks with moveable hands to learn how to tell time.  I was sick that day, but went to school anyways and just vomited all over my clock while I was making it.  My jerklady teacher never bothered to go over what we learned in class after I left so let's just say that it took a few terrible years for me to ask my parents how to tell time.  I am currently majoring in the arts.  God damnit, Mrs. Farrish, you are a terrible terrible woman.

      My problem was always the "identify these coins" handouts they passed out. Listen, teachers, if you enlarge or reduce coins, they obviously aren't the same size, and lots of the dead white guys on American coins basically look alike anyway, especially after God knows how many cycles of duplicating on increasingly poorly-maintained school copy machines. Either give me some real coins to identify or at the very least something worthwhile to do.

      I don't know if it's alcohol-induced psychosis or ignorant ignorance, but it is damn funny Showbiz forgot he can't read a clock. Kindof ironic even, given that dials on amps and the like have numbers going around kinda like a clock.

      I can read analog clocks, but since I always wore a digital watch growing up I never bothered with them so I'm very, very bad at it. It takes a minute or so of staring at it to work out exactly what time it is and then account for being slightly off or so. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've heard the arguments (and disagree with them) but I really wish that the hour hand stayed on the hour it represents. It would be a lot less confusing. I don't want to roughly tell how long there is left by estimating how much space until it reaches the next number. There isn't enough space there to do it properly plus I have another hand for that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Digital is faster and better in every case. It's just superior. Let's move on to the future.
