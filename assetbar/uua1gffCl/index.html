      It would appear that, like so many things in our work-a-day consumerist society, death has become a commodity. <br/> 
Cartilage Head intends to create a sort of living snuff film, in which the viewers need feel no guilt, for the victim expires of presumably natural causes.

      it's true...i mean, the last show we saw CH do ended with him 'dying', going on to prove Ray was a coward that would desert a dying man. <br/>

it would make sense that he needs a 'death' for his next performance, becoming part of the test for another in the audience. <br/>

      CH is a collector of men. <br/> 
He already missed one  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415013849/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=09132005">opportunity</a> , when Beef gave away his ticket to [i]The Coward With Shame On His Hands. <br/>

      Ok, ok, ok, I understand the collector card now I think. The outer ring is an indicator of when the death is likely to happen. Spring being a likely time for Malice and Aspiration, and the long winter a time for Debt, Liquor, and Despair. The closer to the skull the more likely the collector is to cause death. So the Lash of Thantos is a guaranteed death for all seasons.

      I was thinking the seasons were actually seasons of one's life.  Malice is a common death in your youth, foolery when you become a young adult, frailty when you start to become old, and liquor, debt or despair when you are old.  Also, it would like up nicely with the other catagories, aspiration when young, vanity when grown, and disease when old.  Or maybe this is some sort of cartoon about talking stuffed animals.

      Hypothesis: Instead of Roast Beef dying, Cartilage Head has come to ask his permission to use his death in his show. In such shows, Cartilage Head "dies" for others whose deaths are portented. If you can't take it, you are given a business card of you reminding you of your cowardice. Obviously, Roast Beef's Line of Thanatos condition along with his general demeanor will make for a wonderful show for Cartilage Head. My guess is that death by Spring, Summer, or Autumn are the least dramatic for this type of performance.

      That's pretty close to my own interpretation. Beef isn't going to die this time. CH is here to help him. Either in the manner you describe where he somehow nullifies the Lash of Thanatos or because it was an elaborate piece of performance art where the palmist was in on it from the beginning. Perhaps it will teach Beef how to be alive.

      Filler.  And before you lame me, it's just my opinion.  But seriously, there were no jokes, I've seen (way) weirder stuff, and most of the panels are near repeats of each other.  Admittedly, the "Common Collectors of Man" card is kind of cool.

      Cromar, you do remember that lots of classic arcs contain "filler" strips, right?  It's just how it happens in an arc, for the most part. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I recommend waiting until the arc is finished before complaining so much.  Yeah, these "filler" strips can seem boring when you're reading an arc as it happens, but you might change your mind later.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember reading the Lonis Edison strips as they were being produced, and not being that fond of them.  Now?  Probably my favorite arc.  Hell, even the GOF felt slow at times when it happened.

      I found the Lonis Edison strips dull at the time and just as dull now. I did not care for much of them. Yes, there was some greatness, but not enough. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As I've said before this and the last strip could have been edited into a single one fairly easily. If Onstad wants to work the dramatic pauses so hard perhaps slowly produced webcomics are not the best medium for them. It's not like the dude is even doing something other than lightly modifying his copy-and-pastes (though mad chuddies for all the new art in this arc) to get them. He can make a slightly longer strip if he really needs to cram that much in.

      I won't lame you. However, I personally don't think this is filler. It's not a laugh-every-panel kind of strip, that's for sure, but there is plot progression at the very least. And, I admit, this was a 3 that turned into a 4 when I saw the 'Common Collectors' card.

Roast Beef got his palm read, even though he doesn't have hands. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Palmist was horrified because his life line is intersected by the Lash of Thanatos. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cartilage Head knew the exact circumstances under which Roast Beef would be most susceptible to a request for a rare private show featuring Beef's death because he's CH. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The last panel shows an engraved invitation to the show being held by someone with a dewclaw. The invitation indicates that RB accepted the request, and his death will be featured in a CH performance art piece. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What's not to see?

      I like to imagine the common collectors of man card is one of those things where the concentric circles can each rotate individually.  So you can dial in just the right season, proximal and distal cause, and mystical corrolary for any death.  Finally, death made easy.

      I like how everyone's so busy fawning over Cartilage Head's return that they overlook how Onstad derailed the arc in the process. Potentially good idea, bad execution. Isn't this the type of thing he usually gets criticized for? <br/> 
 <br/> 
"The Lash of Thantos" would've been better as a one-off gag about how bad things happen to Roast Beef.

      "Let's see you do better" is a silly counterargument. One does not have to be an expert in something to tell when it's being done bad. And are you telling me you've never criticized anything without doing it yourself? A movie, a meal, a book, nothing? I doubt it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And by that logic, if a person can't criticize something, they can't praise it either. Because if someone can't tell what's bad, then logically, they can't tell what's good either.

      I did not really explain myself. It was poor rhetoric on my part. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the remark of yours that I read as "why isn't anyone else complaining" seems out of a desperation to find fault. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So: <br/> 
Why do you read this comic if you  <em>want</em>  to complain about the direction of the past two comics?, if not out of a desire to complain about every plot or pacing decision Onstad's made that doesn't satisfy your every curiosity? <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you honestly really like Teodor vs. Chuck Williams and hate Cartilage Head, that's cool, but say that, instead of accusing me of having no taste or being unable to criticize anything ever.  <br/> 
Maybe I just don't get so quickly bored of something I invest time in reading that I need to see someone complain about what could be a three strip diversion for all we know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are a lot of things and people in the world I would criticize before this particular Achewood strip, and that's not blind loyalty.

      "Why do you read this comic if you want to complain about the direction of the past two comics?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
What are you talking about? I don't look for things to complain about, but I have to read the comic to know whether or not I like it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"If you honestly really like Teodor vs. Chuck Williams and hate Cartilage Head, that's cool,"  <br/> 
 <br/> 
This isn't about Cartilage Head, this was about how aruptly he was brought into the story. You go from having an erotica contest that Beef was only just brought into to suddenly focusing on Cartilage Head seemingly pursuing Roast Beef and asking if he can "use his death"? Sorry, but I fail to see how someone could find that to be a natural progression of the storyline. And because arupt shifts in the story ARE the type of thing Onstad usually gets criticized for, or at the very least, people express hesitance. I find it confusing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"instead of accusing me of having no taste or being unable to criticize anything ever." <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are taking this far too personally, and acting like I singled you out. Thinking that people are focusing too much on the character's return and not really discussing whether the idea was smoothly integrated into the story is not accusing someone of being incapable of criticism. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Maybe I just don't get so quickly bored of something I invest time in reading that I need to see someone complain about what could be a three strip diversion for all we know." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Being disappointed in the way Onstad handles a plot element cannot be simplified into "being bored with the story". So what if it is a three strip diversion? Dropping another story into the middle of a current story isn't good writing, it's pointless and disruptive. Some might say "Achewood doesn't always tell stories in a conventional structure". No, it doesn't, but "unconventional" and "good" aren't the same things.

      Very true. If you look at things once the erotica contest started it quickly moved over to the Roast Beef plot and from then it has focused entirely on Beef. He shows up to the contest mainly just as an excuse to end it and to try to roughly link it together. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It feels for all the world like Onstad got up to the contest and realized that he just didn't have any idea where to go from here while, at the same time, he had a new idea for Beef. I mean, we had an entire strip devoted to getting Teodor in the suit rather than Ray (the suit itself feeling like it was just an excuse to not draw Chuck Williams, an entirely reasonable thing all told) and then it basically doesn't matter in the slightest. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I feel like Onstad was Ray. He thought he knew what he was getting into, but at the last minute he realized he was in over his head and needed to duck out and try a different tactic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The classier thing to do would have been to try and finish off the previous arc though. Give it a bit of a proper ending before throwing us into something new. It might not be perfect, but it's better than coming off as desperate to move on and short-changing all the build-up of the previous storyline.

      Now that Belgand's added a classier opinion to the mix, I'll be honest. Though I think it was poorly done, and was confused as to why everyone seemed okay with it, my hostility was just trolling. I was irritated, or bored, or something and felt like starting something. I'll admit that we have yet to see how the two arcs will tie in together, and maybe I'll be impressed, but as it stands, I think it was akwardly executed, and I can't help but wonder if Onstad brought back Cartilage Head out of a sincere desire to do something else with him, or whether he ran out of ideas and was trying to cover it up by bringing back an old character. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It doesn't help that I didn't like the Cartilage Head arc. It's quite possible I didn't get it, but either way it didn't entertain me. Had I enjoyed it, I probably would feel more forgiving.

      I contend the hands in the last panel are CH's and RB's. They are still in the aeroplane. The invitation is just a sample CH is showing him to explain what he has in mind. In panel 12, CH is holding the two titular cards, the white one with the diagram of the common collectors of man, and the grey sample invitation.

      What doesn't make sense? Beef, in a fit of morbid curiosity, visited a palmist. The woman in question found a near certain sign that Beef's days were numbered. Distressed, she nonetheless contacted Cartilage Head, who had likely requested that she forward details of any such patron to him for his own enterprises. Having received word from the palmist via... repurposed stock ticker... Cartilage Head set off to strike a deal with Beef while he still had time. Presumably integrating Beef's death into his already distressing act would allow him to reach new highs in the field of performance art, a paradoxical sentence in itself. <br/>

      Greetings fellow Assetbar-barians! I have through a series of unusual events wound up in Toronto for a week. Do any of you live in Toronto, or been there? Are there amusing and entertaining things to do in this place? Are any of the characters from Canada? Thanks in advance for tolerating the off-topic post.  <br/>

Toronto is pretty, and the ladies, they are so pretty.

      "New strip Sunday night Pacific." - This is an interesting combination of specific and vague. Chris doesn't care to tell us what  <em>time</em>  of night he plans post, but he specified the time zone anyway. Is the idea that we're supposed to wait until 12:01 PST and then get pissed off? <br/> 
 <br/> 
'Cause colloquially, I usually call 2:00AM Monday morning "Sunday night" still.
