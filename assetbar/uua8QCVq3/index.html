      I would have thought that Ray wouldn't buy Domino's pizza after Judas Priest Friday. It seems like getting stabbed in the ears by Death, spontaneously combusting and falling out a window would teach you a lesson. I guess I am wrong.

      I believe that was an alternate future in which Ray does NOT go sit in a chair with Phillipe and discuss the Chinese, peanuts and candy, and instead eats the pizza. <br/>

This would also explain who the second person he was talking to is.

      Well now we know that Roast Beef is named after the middle piggy (who ate roast beef) because he is the middle cat (not Ray, not Pat). And since Pat would then be the last cat (or last piggy) he ran wee wee wee all the way home.

      i hae to demonstrate any serious knowledge on nursery rhymes involving the toes (of all things!) but i believe pat would be the piggy who "had none", presumably of the tasty dinner the piggy before him partook in- the spoils, one may argue, of Ray, the piggy who in fact went to market.  <br/>

      OK since other people are being dicks I'll explain (answering both pyro_ike and charchar's questions, I hope): <br/> 
 <br/> 
Philippe went and dutifully counted to 20,000 per his arranged Hide n' Go Seek agreement with Pat.  When he came out, Pat was gone, and Philippe noticed a resting Mr. Bear.  I like to think that Philippe got distracted, as 5 year olds do, and did This Little Piggy on Mr. Bear's foot, only noticing something was wrong when Connie didn't give a little giggle when "this little piggy ran aaaaaall the way home!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is open to interpretation.

      According to Pat, it is Mr. Bear who is counting.  Phillipe is just helping him by timing 20,000 seconds with his stopwatch, one for each number he figures Cornelius is silently counting.  What is ambiguous is why Philipe then played the piggy thing.  For fun?  As a way to test if someone is dead?   <em>Both?</em>

      Yeah, sorry, I meant that he "helped" Cornelius count, but he still counted.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
For your second question, my own particular opinion was expressed above...probably just for fun, the kind of thing a 5 year old might get distracted and do.  Now that I think about it, maybe it was his "fun" way of trying to stir/wake up Cornelius after he realized he wasn't a-seekin' when the time was up.
