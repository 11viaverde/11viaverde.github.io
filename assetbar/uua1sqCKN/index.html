      It was done by Ximena Quiroz in Portland, Oregon -- her shop is called Skeleton Key, its at 18th and Hawthorne in SE Portland. <br/> 
 <br/> 
She's great, she's nice as hell, she's got killer taste in music, and there were Stellas and Creamsicles for all when Onstad drew a picture of a naked Teodor holding an umbrella for me at the signing they had there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're ever in the pacific northwest and need ink injected into your skin, Ximena is the girl to see.

      Even before this strip, I've always felt sort of a connection between the work of David Lynch and Chris  Onstad. There are more than a few surreal moments, and somewhere at the core of Achewood is a dark thing, shrivled and squawking the high pitched warning of a lost dream. <br/>

      Now, this, I don't get.  An Achewood fan disliking something because it doesn't "make sense."  I was able to enjoy a lot more things (including much of Achewood, and David Lynch) when I let go of needing things to make sense.

      It's not just a question of the movie making sense. There's no real theme or averarching thread to the thing. I love David Lynch. Twin Peaks is one of my favorite shows ever, I highly enjoy Lost Highway, Wild at Heart, and Blue Velvet. Eraserhead was good. <br/>

Mulholland Dr? I did not enjoy it. <br/>

      The thing with Mulholland Dr is that it seems to have some kind of hidden meaning, but it doesn't.  So, you don't get it and you go "wow, that movie was so smart I didn't get it at all, it must be a really good movie, let's give it some awards".

      Man I have seen Mulholland Drive much times. I thought I had it figured out, but then a collegue of mine showed me a paper her daughter had done on it at film school. It was really long and insightful, and I remember everything coming together as in a big, sighed  <em>Yes</em> . <br/> 
Sadly, I can't remember much of it now, and the movie has me back to pulling my own hair. I still love it to death, though.

      See, precisely this is part of why I hate him.  People are so mystified by his movies that they think he's a genius and if you don't like the movies it's just because you don't "get" it, that you just don't appreciate him.  There's nothing to get!  He just thinks of esoteric situations and images and haphazardly pieces them together with the barest of narratives, if even he deigns to give them that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not proud that I hate Lynch.  I love challenging movies, and I love movies that take large artistic licenses, and I love ambition and working outside comfort zones and the mainstream.  My favorite movie of late is Synecdoche, New York, which in some circles makes me way too pretentious, and in others not pretentious enough.  I wanted to like Lynch, I really did.  But he's awful.  There is so, so much better out there.

      I see your point, especially about the whole "Emperor's New Clothes" aspect of Lynch's movies.  I submit that a David Lynch movie should be watched in much the same way one might listen to a piece of music, or even look at a painting.  If you take away the need for plot and "sense", you can regard a David Lynch movie as a really stunning collection of bizarre, sometimes uncomfortable, but always evocative, imagery and just enjoy it at face value.  I really enjoy most of his movies, and it's not because I'm so mystified by him that I'm forced to assume he's a genius.

      That's exactly why I want to like him!  So many of his scenes, taken by themselves, are amazingly interesting and evocative pieces of art, like the theater scene in Mulholland Drive.  But those separate scenes simply don't add up to any sort of narrative, or indeed a cohesive film.  So while I can appreciate his artistic talent, I just can't say he's a good filmmaker.

      Certainly valid. Some can take those scenes and run with them in their own imaginations and some can't or don't care to and that's fine. Anyway, you've come a long way from "...I hate Lynch," and that's all I wanted to see happen.

We will carry one copy of any decent film, but it will always be either checked out or (more often) lost within the bowels of our accursedly disorganized system! <br/> 
Meanwhile, we will have 16 copies of the newest comedy that has Will Ferrell running around in his underwear. "You guys still like that, right? Is this still funny?" <br/>

      The first time I saw Eraserhead was Halloween night, four years ago, about three nights after I found out my wife was leaving me.  I watched it alone in our living room, chain smoking cigarettes and drinking straight vodka.  I've never had a movie fit more perfectly with the mood I was already in; Eraserhead is bleak, disgusting, lonely, stark, hauntingly dark and yet strangely humorous...I know I'm not painting a pretty picture here, but the whole thing was just so  <em>appropriate</em>  that it actually ended up being kind of an awesome and weirdly memorable night.

      I love this comment. Probably one of my favorites of all time. <br/> 
I got super curious about eraserhead after seeing all these comments about it and watched some clips on youtube, and I see the strange humor. <br/> 
It's like, the guy's life is just ridiculous, and he's almost laughing at himself in his own miserable way.
