I think the dramatic hangup was to show Beef saying goodbye, slowly and painfully, as the bubble boy did. <br/>

      I felt that Roast Beef had become so depressed by his sad tale that he decided to retreat into the bleak darkness, cutting himself off from the superficial world of lightness and frivolity, for he feels that it is only a dream.  <br/>

      Nah hells no. In the Achewood alternative universe this is actually how the bubble boy's life ended. Beef would not joke about such a thing, he doesn't have it in him to make up such a tragic story just to pull Ray's leg. The silence in the last panels is Ray listening in stunned silence to the tragic tale; Beef had not realised how much his relating of the story would affect both of them and the converstion is now over so there is nothing to do but to slowly hang up the phone.

      Naw, dogg. Beef totally has it in him to make up a thousand stories like this, each more tragic than the last. He's all about inventing horrific scenarios. That's the root of his Strange Cares. Where you been?

      Naw hells and no, dogg. Beef may have it in him to make up a thousand stories, but he would never do so to sass Ray. I think this is a lot like Beef saying how he didn't mind fixing Ray's computer problems as he kept having dreams about apocalyptic machinery - it appears at first like sass, but really it's just insight into Ray's crippling depression. This is how Beef believes the Bubble Boy went - it might be fictitious or it might be exaggerated, but it reflects Beef's own insecurities and sadness, not a desire to weird Ray out.

      Ray doesn't get horrified at Roast Beef too easily, though.  He kind of understands that Beef goes off on tangents like that, and is always depressed.  But I think that's why Beef waited a second- after all, he got depression.

  i think RB stays quiet and then just hangs up because really, what else do you say at the end of such a compelling story?  nothing.  and then you realize you should just hang up.  except, because it is Beef, he relishes that uncomfortable, depressing silence. <br/>

      I must agree with the depression theory. Since the strip is dated after panel 6, the impression is given that Beef hangs up well after the end of the story, after wallowing in the air of depression he has generated. Ray's response is of no importance; Beef is left to consider the many horrors of life in silence and solitude - his preferred media.

      I always wonder why Onstad finishes Beef lines pretty quick. He'll indulge Ray all the time, and especially Cornelius, whose dialog style feels pretty fleshed-out by now because he basically gets bundles of whole strips delivered to his door for free (at least lately). But Beef gets cut off pretty quick and here we finally got to see a full thought process. He cuts his social losses when he goes too far and retreats into the obscuring cloud of depression. The fact that most of the action in the last half is totally ambiguous projects an outcome that would make Achewood overly confusing and even turn people off if repeated. And nobody wants to see that every day.  <br/> 
And I haven't read too far into this, either. It was the perfect amount.

      <em>David had always wanted to try Coca Cola, after seeing it in many commercials and hearing about it from other children, but the sterilization process required to insert it into the bubble ruined the taste. After he exited the bubble, he requested a Coke but was turned down. His mother said, "David had heard the word Coke so often on TV and from other children that he always yearned to try one. It was one of the first things he asked for when he was taken out of his bubble before he died. But the doctors decided he shouldn't have one in his frail condition."</em>

      Ray's trying to sell LN on Chicken a la King, a basic dish of youngsters and cafeterias, while he is clearly wielding a roast chicken.  LN's equally dishonest quip about "allergies" is a subtle acknowledgement of Ray's subterfuge and a refusal to be taken in by such measures.  Ray may or may not realize this, but he calls his general expert on most topics to be sure.
