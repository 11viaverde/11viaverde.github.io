You guys are being a cock to a stranger. I'm just curious about the origin or meaning of the riddle. Why is that lame?

      I don't think it's lame, but man you got slammed for that question.  Personally, I think the sheer inanity of the question is funny.  I think you're probably reading into the meaning a little too much.  I mean, Beef is at a Friendly's in Hell, reading a magic-eye menu that asks him if he's ever had his finger up his butt.  It's supposed to be surreal.

      Oh sure, I realize it's funny because it's an offensive thing to find printed in a menu, and absurd because it's not really a riddle at all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the phrase also exists outside of the comic, and that's what I'm curious about. Best I can figure, it's a ploy to see if the subject is naive/lacking awareness enough to try it right there.  It could also imply the subject is gay (maybe you'd like something else up your own butthole), or is anal retentive (you couldn't stick your finger up there because it's clenched tight), or smells bad (self-explanatory.)

      It is used by people of low mind to inquire if you are gay. It is not a riddle, it is simply a question asked by people who think homosexuality is a bad thing to say "Ha! Hey, I'll bet you stick your finger up your butt because you can't get any REAL dick because you're such a loser!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or to imply that you're bi-curious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or just because you want to know if someone's done it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But it's not a riddle. And it's not exactly that hard a thing to come up with, saying 'the phrase exists outside of the comic' is like saying that when Beef asks Ray if he has any Guinness. You can say "What does 'Do you have any Guinness?' mean? I've heard that outside the comic before." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, the joke is that it sets you up to expect a riddle, and instead it gets a probing question about Beef's anal finger virginity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
CAN I OVEREXPLAIN THIS AND EXTEND THIS POST SIZE ANY LONGER? No. Goodnight.

      For example, the reason Jerry Falwell is still in hell is because the friendly's menu asked him if he was sexually attracted to Tinkie-Winkie. This is not a hard question to know the answer to. But his answer (a fifteen minute long rant about how the telle-tubbies curves were designed to arouse, and movement crafted as a non-verbal plea to be penetrated, absolved him from any guilt for being enamored) failed to earn him passage.

      Friendly's is, sadly, a real place.  It exists in New England (and apparently in California-hell); it seems that the Midwest was spared having to experience this abomination of a restaurant.

      Wrong-o...  There are Friendly's in Ohio at the very least.. Oddly, their website doesn't show any locations in California.  California-Hell, however, does not appear to be covered by the online location list for any major restaurant chain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Side note:  Their food will kill you, but their soft-serve creepy clownhead ice-cream dish is possibly one of my formative pleasant memories of childhood.

      Oh shit I'd forgotten about that.  There food is nasty to a ridiculous extent, but their ice cream is good, and can often be ordered from a window at the side of the restaurant so you don't have to go into the hellmouth.

      I remember watching ads for Friendly's on TV as a kid and getting REALLY excited and begging my parents to take me there.  I was sad when I found out that it was a U.S. broadcast and that there were none in Canada.  Every subsequent Friendly's ad just seemed to taunt me. <br/>

To this day I still desire to dine on ice cream out of a clown's head.

      I can't remember the food/ice-cream much at all from my youth, but my local one in CT was one of the dirtiest franchise restaurants I've ever been in...and on a consistent basis, I remember it always being loud and frantic, and the tables and floors were always sticky and grimey.  When an 8 year old thinks your restaurant is unhygenic, then you got problems. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, within a few years, it was closed down and a Pizza Hut opened up in the same space.  Lateral move, pretty much.

      I do that, then my eyes say "something is there!  I must focus on it." and that goes out the window.  Also when I get them to stay out of focus, I go, "It's a tree!  A dolphin!  I see a line there, it must be a race car!  An airplane!  I can see it!" then I look at the answer and it's a kid fishing or something lame like that that was nothing like what I saw.

      I've still never been able to see anything in one of those, but if that's true maybe there's hope for me yet. Unfortunately, those things all apparently simultaneously evaporated into the ether around 1998.
