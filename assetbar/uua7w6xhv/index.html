      Interesting tidbit about yeast infections, and indeed  <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003337/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans">Candida albicans</a></em> , the fungus that causes it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As well as naturally occurring (generally without issue) in your gastrointestinal tract and mouth, it also occurs - due to the mouth/nose connection - in the nasal cavity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Why is this interesting?  Because, apparently, my sinuses are highly allergic to it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em><strong>To something that naturally occurs in your motherFUCKING nose.</strong></em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
This has to be the stupidest damned allergy that I know someone having. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The next few, in order: <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. Horribly allergic to bandaids (all-round tough guy and man's man brother-in-law, who has made half the furniture in his house out of steel, hardwood and brawn) <br/> 
3. Penicillin (other brother-in-law, dock worker, wouldn't have survived WWII if he was a soldier) <br/> 
4. Sulphur (comically ditzy mother - this one doesn't come up much except when we go to the local springs) <br/> <br/> <br/> But #1, fucking  <strong>easily</strong> , is taken out by being essentially allergic TO YOURSELF.

      My cousin was allergic to his own SKIN. It almost killed him but they managed to save him in one of those medical-miracle kind of things. He later OD'd on crystal meth when he was in his early 20s.

      It is possible to be allergic to semen. I am not making this up at all. It sounds quite unpleasant to be a lady with this sort of condition. <br/>

Sadly I'm allergic to both penicillin and morphine. I really do not desire to get hurt.

      It takes a whole lot for me to put someone on ignore.  Though I am lukewarm at best about blastradius' comments, verily, he has lamed me thoroughly in the past, I ultimately agree with them.  The only things I mark as lame are things that make the thought "That was lame" appear in my head as I read them. This was not the case.

      I was with you in the first post, but I find that lames give the forum a little bit of spam control, as well as incentive for forum etiquet. <br/> 
While living in fear of posting an unpopular opinion may be an unwelcome effect of this, I can't say it is the worst scenario, either. Keeps the snicks in line, and is more welcome than a heaping of flame posts. Also, the moderation in which one must use lames keeps this in check as well. <br/>

Full Metal Jacket is pretty much one of the greatest films ever made.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, I think I shall cease discussing movies on this board because I remember why I stopped posting on messageboards in the first place - once you have come to a certain point, arguing about movies or politics or your favourite colour or whatever is pretty stupid; it's only your own opinion that really counts, and provided that you aren't some moron, this will be evident in the long run through the decisions you make in life. <br/>

If you as a person (or any of us) want what you say to have some weight, you have to achieve something or it's all hot air. This is why people care what Warren Buffet has to say about the stock market, but the ramblings of two random douchebags on money.cnn.com are worthless. And even then, what most "experts" have to say on a topic can be worthless too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you want to mould peoples' opinions you have to do with through means other than well written internet posts. <br/>

      As far as the character's making sense in Full Metal Jacket, speaking as someone currently employed in the armed forces, I have seen enough cases of war related PTSD and people's mind snapping in basic traning to accept the caharacter's as at least an exaggeration of people I know. Staff Sergent Hartman, however, I can accept at face value. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My main concern with that movie is mainly that it was two movies. The first time I saw the thing, I had no clue until half way through that Joker was the main character and narrator. Otherwise, I thought it was an okay film.

      I didn't mean the characters weren't realistic people, I just meant that they changed their opinions and attitudes in ways that weren't really tied up in the causality of the on-screen events, and in any case we weren't given enough time with any of the characters to actually develop a sense of why they were acting the way they were, so their actions were either unbelievable or perplexing. Maybe there were just too many characters? I only saw this movie yesterday, so I'm still thinking it through, and I'll probably have to see it a few more times before I'm sold either way, but on my first viewing I saw nothing on par with other Kubrick films except a couple visual parallels and the line, "SIR, I THINK I MEANT TO SUGGEST SOMETHING ABOUT THE DUALITY OF MAN, SIR, YOU KNOW, THE JUNGIAN THING, SIR" or whatever it is. This attitude seems to have earned me something like 11 or 12 lames at press time, but I guess I'll just be a lame martyr for it since I have for some reason been "out of lames" for about a month and a half. I guess that's for the best though.

      Everyone is allowed their opinion, and getting lamed for it really isn't that big of a deal. Do you really expect anyone to agree with you? I found years ago that expecting people to agree with your opinions is about the damn dumbest thing one can do in their life. Opinions are the stuff of our insides, colored by our socialization and perception, and no one is going to have the exact same opinion. Frankly, I like being disagreed with. Well, provided the person disagreeing with me can argue their case like a rational human being, and not like a hormonally addled 13-year-old fuck tard with rabies. Though I will chubby you for your fervent defense of your opinion. 'Tis your right, and way to have stones.

      As I understand it, and I may be wrong about this, the reason Full Metal Jacket seems like two movies is because technically it's a literary adaptation of a novel with three discreet parts. Kubrick kept the first part more or less stand-alone, then merged the second and third parts together for the Vietnam section of the film. <br/>

      Without really disagreeing with your point, I'd like to defend Roger Ebert and what he does.  Ebert's skill isn't Knowing What's Best, it's neatly summarizing a movie.  He doesn't just discuss what appeals to him about a movie, he discusses what might appeal to who about it.  He also presents his own opinions in an honest and funny way, but even those who disagree with him can get some use in his work. <br/>

Also, irateturk, I think he/she/it was saying that there is nothing meaningful in itself about being rich and/or influential because those things can  <em>also</em>  be achieved in ways that depend more on luck than on mastery.

      I like Kubrick all right but can do without his internet fanbase.  All the detail in his films inspires the worst kind of paranoiac-critical fallacy, frame-by-frame Da Vinci Code games, and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003337/https://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/">such arguments as</a>  "Kubrick is so perfectionistic that all his mistakes must actually be intentional!

      The reason people usually flip out about lolcats is that they are horribly overused, that and the fact that 99.997% of them are incredibly stupid.  This is one of the .003% that are actually funny, but many still have difficulty suppressing the "lame the lolcat" instinct.  This instinct helps us to survive the rough voyage across this sea of idiocy known as TEH INTARNETZ.  While I admit that it is unfair to maximumcans, the anti-lolcat vigilance is necessary to avoid being PWN3D BY A 1337 H4XORZ while enduring taunts of STFU n00b I M IN UR BAS KILLING YOUR MANS and U R TEH SUKZORS OMGWTFROFLMAOBBQBRBTTFN I <3 pr0n <br/>

      I liked ACO, but it is still only my seventh favourite Kubrick film, after Dr. Strangelove, Paths of Glory, Barry Lyndon, Spartacus, Full Metal Jacket, and 2001.  Which actually says quite a lot for Kubrick. <br/>

      I agree, though I would probably place Spartacus a little higher on the list. It's interesting that of Kubrick "futuristic" films (2001 and ACO - haven't seen AI) ACO seems so dated and 2001 continues to hold up - even its special effects are watchable. <br/>

      Well, appropriate enough; Anthony Burgess was a self-obsessed right-wing twit - a house-proud part of a British tradition of obsessing over how horrible and numerous your inferiors (usually colonials with a stupid religion without vicars or buggery) are - so 'pubescent pretentiousness' is a pretty good call. The only good thing that can be said for Kubrick doing Clockwork Orange is that the ending made Burgess, who was in every respect the inferior craftsman but good luck convincing him of that, all pissy and dour.

      It was an absolute butchery of the book. The casting was atrocious and contradicted every description in the book. The plot was rearranged for no reason. Key character-defining events were left out and a bunch of scenes just completely made up. Rargh, it just makes me so  <em>angry</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
The 1998 version with Jeremy Irons was far superior. Of course it was a bit melodramatic, but at least it stayed true to the material and preserved the emotional impact, rather than taking the opposite route and just making the whole thing a lighthearted comedy like Kubrick did. The comedic element in the book came mainly from Nabokov's wordplay, and there's just no way to represent that in film, so I think the later movie was the best possible adaptation.

      Alas, better adaptations do not necessarily make for better films -- a death match between  <em>Everything Is Illuminated</em>  and  <em>The Human Stain</em>  immediately comes to mind. I'd argue the merits of Lyne's version with you, but despite the sometimes subtly hilarious cinematography, it was too boring to finish. And I've read the novel a dozen times, with Tarkovsky films as coffee breaks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Alternatively: Stephen King? Is that you?

      I haven't seen The Human Stain, but I'll assume you're saying that it was a faithful adaptation and a poor movie, while Everything Is Illuminated was a loose adaptation and a great movie, because the reverse would mean that there was not enough room on this Assetbar for the both of us. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's a shame you didn't finish the Lyne version. It does drag on (actually in the same way and in the same places that I thought the novel did), but the ending is pretty well done both in its style and the subtle ways in which it hints at Humbert being an unreliable narrator. Oh well, chubby for well-informed disagreement.

      Oh, I dunno. Dune has some moments of excellence. Also it's visually awesome in two ways. The set design is exquisite in parts - the Geidi Prime scenes are insane. And it's way way 80s. I mean it looks like Tron but evil.

      Yeah, it was sad day when they had to remake Kubrick to get the book right. Of course, Stephen King despisde Kubrick's THE SHINING and arranged to have that movie remade. The remake was OK; it did too much backfilling to explain things From Long Ago; I thought that took too much time. The last thing a horror movie can be is S . . . L . . . O . . . W . . .

      I'm making my first post ever (after months of lurking) to tell you how much I agree. Lolita is one of my favorite novels, and I have just never been able to watch the film without comparing it to the novel and grumbling to myself (and occasionally ranting to the poor soul who agreed to watch with me) the entire time.

To your point: there's the old saying that a bad book makes a great movie and vice versa.  Of course, there are a few notable exceptions.  Just one of those things, I guess.

      I think just making a movie based on Lolita was Kubrick's "statement" - the particulars of the movie were taboo and virtually unfilmable in 1962, which his why he relies on extra-literary stuff like Seller's burlesques to take up screen time.

      The couch scene where they sing and he orgasms with a little girl innocently sitting beside him; the initial sex scene in the hotel; her girlfriend Mona talking in a "sexy" voice trying to seduce Humbert... There's quite a few racy scenes. And the concept of an older man keeping a thirteen year old as his little concubine was racy enough to begin with in 1962.

      I don't think that keeping a thirteen year old as a "concubine" is racy - it's generally considered criminal.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As to the couch scene, I think that could be done tastefully. The "initial sex scene" could probably be done without showing the sex, plus that would help bring out the ambiguity of whether or not it was consensual. The Mona scene doesn't actually have to be filmed with Mona being deliberately sexy, or it could just be filmed that way, because it's not obscene (in the censorship sense).

      Did you see how they did it in the '98 film? There's a sort of slow montage scene where it shows their home life. At one point it shows her sitting on his lap reading a book and you're supposed to think they're sharing an innocent father/daughter moment. Then as the camera pans down you realize that her hips are moving.

      Well, I saw that film many years ago, so I can't remember. Unfortunately, my memory is so bad that I can't remember if I thought that she was doing it deliberately in the book. Of course, part of the problem is that HH is an unreliable witness. One thing that I don't remember taking from the film at all was that it was entirely his recollection.

      There used to be a place in the East Village called the Korova Milkbar. The front looked pretty much like the bar in the movie, but beyond that it was just a regular hipster bar - no milk or drugs, unfortunately. On the plus side, there were huge comfy round chairs, they were always showing weird Japanese movies on the TV screens, and their Blueberry Cosmos were excellent. It closed a couple of years ago :-(

      there was a club in Moscow called Trish that actually had the mannequin bodies coming out of the wall and you could drink cold milk out of their tits - they even had little plastic slip cover dispensers all over so you wouldn't have to put your mouth on plastic tit infected with the diseases of the moscow club-going public (TB). It was pretty cool though. There were no drugs in the milk but everyone there was already on drugs anyway.

      I wanted to comment on it earlier, but I was already accused of being pedantic that day, and didn't want to be  <em>that guy</em> .  I don't know how well versed in the internet you are, but calling these pictures avatars is nothing new.  I'm pretty sure every forum or BBS that I've been a member of refers to these as avatars. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To be a dick about terms: an icon is a picture that represents or illustrates a concept or message sans words. Avatar has an etymology that eludes me at the moment, but it goes back to some hindu belief about reincarnation (I think), and this is usually used when an icon represents a living thing.

      The first time I saw avatar used in the context of an icon paired with a post on a forum was about 8 years ago.  I think it was some flavor of those phBB things.  It was by no means cutting eqdge, allowing users to choose from a wide array of stock Fat Albert pictures and some old Space Ghost-ish monsters.  I'm pretty surprised that not many people have encountered similar usage.

      Right, but language and physical objects are different.  Words gain currency in the language as meaning a certain thing through using said word to mean said thing.  That's the reason you run from  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">cops</span> , and delete  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">spam</span>  from your inbox that is  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">phishing</span>  for your bank info. <br/>

I could use your same logic to argue that these aren't icons because they don't depict something sacred, like a saint.

      Well, no. Because the term "icon" has been in use in computing for a long, long time, and gained currency with huge numbers of people. By contrast, "avatar" in the sense you propose, although you may have been using it when animal skins were still in fashion, did not go much beyond your circle for a long, long time (i.e. just now).

      Just because a "huge number of people" use a word incorrectly doesn't mean the actual meaning will change, at least not right away.  Especially if these people are mostly young and poorly educated and come to realize they have been misusing terms.

      Well, icon certainly wasn't being used to refer to little computer pictures long before there were operating systems with GUIs.  I'd imagine the use of the word 'avatar' to describe pictures like this was not  <em>too</em>  far on its heels, in terms of the expanses of time it takes for a word to be generally accepted as meaning something new. <br/>

I propose we officially kill off the discussion of avataricons and instead cuss out people who say 'irregardless'.  <strong><em>fuck them</em></strong>

      Yeah, I don't mind being that guy who wonders about work use and meanings.  And I thank you for the help.  Perhaps a compromise would be to call these postage stamp things icons that can also depict an avatar, leaving avatar for the truly 3-D things that walk around in virtual worlds and have bodies.  Icons are little pictures and symbols for things.

      Perhaps the most fascinating thing about Achewood Assetbar is its language. The posters think and talk in the "asschat" (Achewood fandom) vocabulary of the future. A doctor in the strip explains it. "Odd bits of black urban slang," he says. "A bit of Internets talk, too. But most of the roots are self-referential.  Wanking.  Navel-gazing."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Asschat is not quite so hard to decipher as Cretan Linear B, and the posters translate it. I found that I could not read the board without compiling a glossary; I reprint it here, although it is entirely unauthorized, and some of it is guesswork. <br/> 
 <br/> 
all - Adverbial intensifier, from African-American Vernacular English (AAVE).  "All givin hella chubbies and lames." <br/> 
 <br/> 
[i}%312DAssetbarf%215C[/i] Tourettes-like outbursts of ASCII characters and question-mark icons that occur without warning and are quickly apologized for or bemoaned.  Origin never satisfactorily explained. <br/> 
 <br/> 
chubby - Good.  Also, a unit of attentional currency. <br/> 
 <br/> 
dogg - One's friend, from AAVE.  Use is multiply ironic in that the Achewood characters and presumably all Assetbar posters are cats, humans and other non-canine animals who likely grew up not speaking AAVE. <br/> 
 <br/> 
doubleplusgood - Double chubby. <br/> 
 <br/> 
hella - Adverbial intensifier, from AAVE (West Coast). <br/> 
 <br/> 
lame - Bad.  Also, a unit of controversy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
lame-out - To disappear down the memory hole by incurring multiple lames. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Stad - The author of the strip.  Asschat is so constructed that one literally cannot create a sentence critical of Stad or his works without committing thoughtcrime.

      This episode of Great Moments in Cinema features perhaps the least involvement of Roomba than any previous installment.   Roomba must be gradually making the move from actor to director to executive producer.   Sure, it's still used for transport, but it is very backgrounded.   I was intrigued by the dialogue of this strip to such an extent that I forgot that Roomba was even a presence, until I reread it and wondered what the cylinder was doing on Teodor's bed.

      His performance was all right.  I wish some of the magic had been left at the end, though.  They didn't need to explain  <em>every</em>  trick.  Certainly not in a five-minute montage cutting back and forth between a bunch of shit we'd already seen and Paul Giamatti with his mouth hanging open like a dumbass.

      I'll bet that this comic is born out of sincere affection.   <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>  is one of those films that can inspire some overboard devotion when one first discovers it, like juanclaudius describes above.  So it's pretty funny to see the movie tweaked even if you love it, recognizing that the film and a person's devotion to it were both products of their times.

      In most cases, it is perfectly fine to end a sentence with a preposition.  Early grammarians wanted to make English sound more like Latin, which they considered to be a higher and more elegant language, so it was taught for a number of years that a sentence should never end with a preposition.  Winston Churchill, when a newspaper editor changed one of his sentences that violated this "rule", wrote the editor a letter in which he said "This is the kind of impertinence up with which I shall not put".  There is not, and never has been, an explicit rule against ending sentences with prepositions, and if anyone has told you differently, you have been lied to.

Mostly because the more clauses you have up front, the harder it is to get through. Hamhock had the structure ok but used some needless words, which suck up any sentence (rule #17).

      I first read "A Clockwork Orange" in Russian class (before most of you were born, and I'm not your daddy) and loved it.  All the slang is based on Slavic word roots.  "Rabbit" for a job, "robot" is "work" in Slavic tongues, now a famous word for mechanical creatures.  "Horrowshow" is nice play on Russian term for "very good."  It went on from there.

      Hey, this ain't news to  <em>me</em> , pal! <br/>

Yea, it was actually pretty ingenious. Not only are the slang terms derived from Russian words, but they are loosely transliterated into English words that give specific connotations to the meanings they are trying to express rather than just being arbitrary silly-sounding terms (for example, "lewdies" for "people").
