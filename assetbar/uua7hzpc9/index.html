NPH basically saved it, though. Nathan Fillion is a good actor but he can't sing worth shit, and the only redeeming factor of his character in that is that it's basically a parody of Nathan Fillion's persona.

      But dude(tte)...  <em>Another Joss Whedon musical</em> . And if the ending's fairly standard Whedon, it's still good by the standards of 99% of the shit Hollywood puts out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like Achewood; I'm no big fan of the current arc by Achewood standards, but I'll follow along, simply because it's  <em>so much better</em>  than virtually any other comic I could read (N.B.: This may well change with Gaiman's Batman two-parter.) Similarly, while Dr. Horrible doesn't begin to compare with Firefly, it's still Joss Whedon, and therefore gets a  20 bonus to Awesome.

      I'm pretty sure in this case Booty Economics will not work, mostly because Connie has nothing Ray can't get, besides a hot stripper girlfriend.  If I'm reading this right (and that's no guarantee), Ray is going to use his newfound leverage with Cornelius to place even bigger bets on their pool games, and therefore lose even larger amounts of money.  And that's assuming that Cornelius (a) thinks that having sex at Ray's place would be good times, (b) feels indebted to Ray for making it happen, and (c) hasn't already left in a huff.  None of these seem very likely, so it looks like this is one Ray Smuckles scheme that's going into the RE-THINK AND MAYBE TRY AGAIN LATER IF I REMEMBER box.

      It will work though. Cornelius is likely only turning down Ray's generous wager as he feels slightly bad about fleecing him so badly. Once offended he will perhaps have less reason to feel upset about taking his crass, boundary-crossing money.

      Is only for truly special occasions. For man of Cornelius' age, a love making must be truly special. <br/>

At moment of climax, as lovers come together and shudder in delight, eggs in nest begin to hatch. Mother bird flies through open window, heaving food to her new babies. The cycle of life, she begins anew as the miracle of love winds down beneath them. <br/>

A bird willingly rests over the bows of this event.

      Dear christ, I ain't even realize that. I forget about dear Space Moose. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember when I first discovered Space Moose. I was 14, and the entire concept struck me as genius. At the time, I couldn't imagine a comic quite as entertaining. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The weird thing about it was that the author was a very intelligent person who I beleive has a doctorate in biomedical engineering. The idea that he spent part of his college career penning a comic about a socially deranged moose who thinks nothing of raping his closest friends just adds to the overall hilarity. I learned more words for boners and bodily excretions than I ever thought I would need that summer. It was a truly special time.

      Vlad is Polish. In an earlier strip, he mentions pierogi. In russian it is a vareniki. Anglosized, Vlad would have called a dumpling. He may have used it as a slang term for Pirozhki, which is made of leavened bread and is considered a pie, which can still be enjoyed by friends, but I think he meant the standard issue pierogi you can purchase at the store, which oddly enough is polish but based on a Russian recipe(Potato, cheese and onion.)

      Is that the same as Russian golubki? Boiled bell peppers stuffed with ground meat? Because that shit is disgusting. My grandma used to make me eat it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I always generally feel kind of shafted when it comes to ethnic food. Like, yes, there are unique Russian/Ukranian dishes, but for the most part a typical Russian meal is chicken and mashed potatoes. And even the unique stuff we have is not that impressive - dumplings and little meat pies, big whoop, and you can only eat so much fried pork fat. The really good stuff like shashlyk and all sorts of yummy spicy meats come from the Caucasus region. It's a good thing we conquered all of them so their food can now be served at Russian restaurants.

      I'm with you on this. They taste very alkaline I think. That's what I have against most tomatoes unless they're processed in some form. I think I'm just very sensitive to that particular type of flavor. <br/>

      I may be wrong, but in my experience they're all exactly the same. Green ones go yellow if you leave them on the stalk, then to orange, then red.  <br/> 
 Granted, there is more sugar conversion by the time they are fully red. <br/> 
 They and all peppers are related to tomatoes, which are, in turn, familially related to deadly nightshade. <br/>

Does anyone not know the anecdote of the French chef in the White House who tried to assassinate George Washington with a stew made of tomatoes? <br/>

      I know this. It does not remove the fact that everything about them is terrible. It just makes them less pungent and spicy (not that there's much spice to be had to begin with). Removing the membrane is not enough.

      I agree. I can taste bell peppers or mushrooms from the other side of a pizza I've split with someone else. Even their smell is almost enough to put me off. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically what I'm saying is that vegetables have absolutely no place on a pizza. Pineapple, not being a vegetable, is still OK though. Garlic might be the only exception and I can generally deal with spinach, but that's the limit.

      I prefer pepperoncini. Jalapeno tends to be too strong in flavour for me and overpowers the other ingredients. Also, it might not be common in your area (I was astounded when I started seeing it all over after I moved), but linguica is excellent on a pizza. It has a smoky flavor that works astoundingly well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One of the better pizzas is linguica and pepperoncini on a cornmeal crust at this great place near me that also has some damn good Brazilian food. Oh $DIETY... I so want a nice big bowl of feijoada right now.

      Unless they've changed very recently Chipotle is not organic at all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Zapatos is right though. Tabasco is not a good choice for hot sauces. If I want Louisiana-style I go with Crystal, if I want something for Mexican I tend to use either Cholula or Tapatio (mainly because it's basically what you find at just about every taqueria in town, but I usually use their own homemade salsas), and if I'm spicing up Asian food and I'm either at home or there isn't a jar of pepper sauce on the table I'll reach for my Sriracha (again, it's the default hot sauce at every Asian place). <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you think Chipotle is good though, man, you need to go to even the weakest of local taquerias and prepare to be blown away by what I wouldn't wipe my ass with. The Mission burrito was born here and is the subject of the sort of bitterly fought battles that our New York brethren fight over pizza (finding good pizza here is hard enough to do that we don't even get a chance to fight about it). Picking sides in some cases is like joining a street gang. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chipotle? I think they have a sad little location downtown, but I honestly don't know why they even try. If it's all you have, it's... well, it  <em>is</em>  food and I was there once too, but damn man, you're missing out on the big leagues. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Wow, I just realized that I can't even get horchata, agua fresca, Jarritos, or even something as basic as Mexican Coke at Chipotle. I mean, what the fuck man? Do they just hate the idea of being decent?

      This is a common condition, but it is not an addiction. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What has happened is that your taste buds have become so desensitized that they cannot detect the flavors of foods unless there is a large amount of capsaicin present. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This condition is not always permanent.  Going for a long enough time without lots of hot sauce on your food may allow you to taste foods without putting lots of hot sauce on them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I not suggesting that you do this, since it would require you to go for a long time eating tasteless food.  But it is likely that if your supply of capsaicin-bearing condiments were cut off against your will, eventually you would be able to taste your food again.

      I wasn't saying they were too spicy, but that their flavor didn't seem appropriate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like my spicy food to be... more moderate. I don't want it to overwhelm anything. I typically also stick with medium when dealing with Mexican/Tex-Mex sort of stuff and I don't care for Tabasco (both flavor and I find it a bit too spicy... I use Crystal when I need a Louisiana-style hot sauce), but when you give me a proper curry then I can easily go quite a lot hotter. It's a different sort of heat entirely.

The effect of capsaicins is to "burn" or dull the taste buds, so larger doses are needed as you basically ruin your sense of taste.

      Do you have proof that that is the effect of capsaicins? Because I love the 'effect' of capsaicins on my nervous system when I dice a habanero pepper into an omelette and ingest, and yet some of these peppers still I call 2 x 4 smashmouth because that is what it feels like in mouth. And general alimentary system sooner or later.  <br/>

Capsaicin stimulates blood flow. I know this because I had a tube of topical ointment made from a derivative for soccer aches and pains.  <br/>

      Onion is a vegetable, and onion holds a place of honor on pizza. <br/>

Not every pizza I eat, of course.  But on pizzas where onion is appropriate, it is an awesome addition. <br/>

      Not a fan of onion. I mean, as an aromatic it is very important, but on it's own? Not really my sort of thing. Oddly I find onion rings to be good, but I find they're much better if you remove the onion itself from the fried batter.

      That pizza is an abomination. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pepperoni and Italian sausage is the default "best pizza". More meats can be added, however, and other meat-based pizzas are delicious. Pesto pizza can also be pretty damn tasty. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I must amend my earlier statement slightly as I am now reminded of a place that does a great pesto-potato pizza. Potatoes are totally in too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically the standard vegetable toppings read like a list of my absolutely most hated foods. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On this subject fruit is obviously superior. Evolution in animals and plants have combined to make fruit awesome. It is sweet, edible raw, generally easily eaten, and simple to harvest without causing any damage to the plant. We cannot digest the seeds. Plants want us to eat their fruit and pass the seeds elsewhere to spread. We have joined forces to make fruit something we will want. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Vegetables, however, are typically parts of the plant that it wants for itself. Often they are very essential parts of the plant or the entire plant. They are, in many cases, flavored to discourage us from eating them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize that this does not apply to peppers and tomatoes because both are, technically, fruits, but they're poison fruits and... well, just fuck them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That may be true, but my point remains valid!

You're right, and I remember the "Pepper Battle," where they said many times how the Japanese don't know bell peppers very well and don't generally like them, so that big chomp by the Chairman apparently had extra wow in Japan.

      Back in the day, that one time I was able to eat peyote without getting sick and had a borderline religious experience, we ended up at a nice Italian restaurant on College Av. in Berkeley.  We were sort of buzzing away, looking at the menu, looking at each other, and trying not to get all slippery or otherwise outstanding, and up walks the waiter.  It seemed like it had been a while.  I glanced around the table and knew that no one was even close to being ready to order.  The glowing green light in my forehead reflected off the white table cloth, and I knew what to do.  "Extra large pizza w/ bell pepper, please!" I instructed the servitor.  I glanced around the table again - the relief and approval were plain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That was one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten in a long career of pizza gormandizing!

Peppers stuffed with tomato, cheese, rice, and ground meat (and of course spices and other flavouring) are very near pizza for me.  Good hot, good cold, in big or small doses.  Their only disadvantage is being somewhat seasonal.

      I got it after scorpio posted and then I kicked myself a bit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We had a big standing teeter-totter (in my mind that is the difference, you sit on a see-saw) and kids would pile on and take turns rocking back and forth and planning on jumping to jam the other side down. It was tense, like cold war of playground. One time, though a girl fell forward or something and slammed into the chest/stomach-high upside-down U-shaped handles and got hurt very badly. This was an upper-middle class suburb so her parents sued and eventually the city, fearing a lawsuit, removed them from all parks. Later on the tire swing was gone. Then they removed the posts of the teeter-totter. Now when I look at a playground I just see dull plastic lies. I mean, they're not nearly as interesting looking, there's no chance to get a splinter on all the wood, and there's nothing really high enough to jump off of. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd hate to be a kid now.

      Yeah, I had this problem too. After Cornelius' statement and Vlad's appearance I first assumed that they had left in a huff over Ray's poor manners, but now... now it looks like Ray just went to get the door, but we never even heard the doorbell or anything. A panel of Ray leaving the site of his social gaffe would have helped, but the title of "Flubbus Interuptus" kind of lets us know that it is a sidebar between Ray and Vlad. Still, not ideal.

      I think Vlad was just hanging around Ray's house, it is fairly massive. He was probably part of some U-bend party or pork-chop tasting session in a completely different part of the building that Ray had forgotten about. <br/> 
Or perhaps he just knocked on the door to ask his bad dog friend if he wanted to get stinky at the bar that night. <br/>

      I think that in order to be a concept poster one has to clearly be playing a role that is not just their own personality. As far as I could tell, Retardo was actually somewhat serious, since he would accuse people of being homophobic and got all huffy and left to find a more 'open-minded' forum. Similarly, lechatbotte actually was an "everyone is beautiful and special" hippie type. And AIU claimed to be playing a role, but by all indications actually was an emotionally unstable and socially retarded nerd. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe what I'm describing is more of a 'character poster'. But if a 'concept poster' is just one that harps on the same theme most of the time, then a lot of us would be concept posters in some way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps there's a further distinction between character posters and character trolls in that the former actually interact with and respond to other posters instead of just randomly spamming the page with their particular schtick. In that case, Glad would probably be the only character poster I can think of.

      I read almost everything through the first time when it was new (I believe I started reading Achewood around the time that Beef went to the moon) and I just recently completed re-reading everything so I could get my official tally back up. I re-read a bunch of older comments and left a ton of my own, but since I wasn't taking part in the discussions I missed some of it and didn't get the full experience.

      in night we met <br/> 
in morn i part <br/> 
t'was enough to whet my palate. <br/> 
at least it's a stare. <br/> 
 <br/> 
'sorry to see you' <br/> 
the words i say <br/> 
i know not what i do. <br/> 
'ever see me again' <br/> 
for the rest of your days. <br/> 
 <br/> 
next time will be better, surely, <br/> 
or so to me they say. <br/> 
they also tell me not to worry. <br/> 
'at least you didn't have to pay!' <br/> 
i still wish i wouldn't cum so early. <br/> 
 <br/> 
this is actually a good poem about me and my sex life. please email to your friends it's pretty good, i say to myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
surely twice.

      mmyes, i take to my evening jacket and a snifter of some fine german wine as i peruse the Ached Wood before Mitsy and I retire to the boudoir.    This eve I find myself disappointed in the the quality of the art-comedy strip which I've come to hold dear to my heart, and instead of smirking softly to myself at the antics of a one Mr. Raymond Q.

      I say good sir*, but I must disagree with your assessment there in part. The lady, though she be of low station to begin with, was shown to be a lady of class almost immediately despite her harlotous ways and being seduced so easily into riding into a miniature gravity-carriage with Mr. Cornelius Bear. Was this merely a distressingly  <em>modern</em>  (and I do not say this term lightly) take on Pygmalion he would have needed to gently educate and likely strike the poor unfortunate for quite some time until she was able to be properly rehabilitated. Itself a concept that I regard as highly dubious and valid only as it serves as a form of moral instruction on the importance of being British to the youth of today. Miss Polly is most likely a lady of proper attitudes who was brought low in a most disagreeable accident, likely one involved a disputed will, and was rescued from her sad state by Mr. Bear. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*It is inconceivable that a lady, definitely one of culture and breeding, would be taking to the Lightning Box in order to discuss such matters. Regardless of your calling card I shall acknowledge that you must surely be a gentleman engaged in some sort of antic, perhaps for our amusement. It is a proven fact that there is no greater japery than that of a man dressed as if he 'twere a lady.

      I was aware of that problem, but I also didn't just want to be a complete dick all over the place like that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the same time since Mr. Bear has taken a liking to Polly it would imply that there was something wrong with him if she was the problem. You can't impugn the man by proxy either. <br/>

      I thought I might share my Onstad meeting with you guys. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, I showed up at Austin Books at around 8 and there was already a huge line. I bought The Great Outdoor Fight and had brought along the Achewood Cookbook, which had been a birthday gift to my friend Jameson, who likes to cook. Jameson, having had very great success with the Rude Chicken, had given me very specific advice to give to Mr. Onstad.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So about two hours and five beers later me and my girlfriend finally got up to the front, I introduced myself to the main gent and he did the same to me, and then I said, "My friend Jameson wanted me to let you know that the Rude Chicken was a huge hit at a party of his." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Is that the beercan one?" asked Mr. Onstad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"That's the one," my girlfriend said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Cool, good to hear," he said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"As a matter of fact," I said, "I'm under very specific instructions to tell you that on a scale of 1 to 10, it rated  <em>an erection.</em> " (It should be noted that upon hearing the words "specific instructions" my girlfriend immediately bowed her head and walked away, knowing full well what the instructions were.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
To my relief, he laughed at that as he drew a Chef Beef on the cookbook, and said, "So what does that rank as? A six or seven?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"That would depend largely on the erection, I'd imagine," I said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Well, everything's bigger in Texas, right?" he asked. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I thought about that, and then said, "No." <br/> 
 <br/> 
This he found to be greatly humorous, and he said, "Listen, I don't want this to get too personal or anything..." <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was then that I became aware that I discussing my penis with Chris Onstad. Needless to say, this was neither the direction I had wanted or expected. Half-panicking, I muttered something about how all day people had been saying, "Now Robert, don't make Chris Onstad talk about your penis," and I had been all, "Oh well I'll try I guess but no promises." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, after that he told me not to cook the chili and we got a picture with him (on my girlfriend's phone - don't have the pic handy) and that was the end of that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I apologize for the delay in posting this. It is currently snowing in Austin and I was required to drink beer in the snow.

      "As a matter of fact," said Norman, "I'm under very specific instructions to tell you that on a scale of 1 to 10, it rated an erection." <br/> 
 <br/> 
To his relief, Chris laughed at that as he drew an exact depiction of his own erection on the cookbook, and said, "So what does that rank as? A six or seven?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Norman looked at the drawing of Chris's cock and was astounded. It was the most perfect erection he had ever seen! He allowed his eye to follow each perfect line that Chris had drawn, around the perfect balls along the elegant curved shaft and lingering around the juicy strawberry tip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"So? What does it rank as?" repeated Chris, this time with a little more urgency in his voice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Norman's mind was racing. He didn't want to appear too eager, and yet it was clear that Chris's erection deserved the maximum possible rating - maybe even more. But the more he thought about it, the more he felt electricity coursing through his body, and the less his brain could focus on an empirical rating system. Soon his own cock was stirring in his trousers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Suddenly Chris was calm. He was smiling. Had he felt the electricity too? The rating didn't matter any more. Nothing did. He reached forward and seductively ran a finger along the shaft that was clearly visible in Norman's pants. Norman looked around for his girlfriend, but she had disappeared to the cooking section and wouldn't be back for some time.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chris could sense Norman was nervous, as he began to undress him, and he realized this would be the first time that Norman would experience man-love in a crowded bookshop. But the sexual energy was infectious, and soon the Texas Longhorns, who had been queuing behind Norman, began undressing too!

      since you asked, i was going to post an excerpt from my paper. but heidegger is one of those things that you have to have a special vocabulary for, and when you take a class on heidegger, there are at least 20 (often hella hyphenated) terms that you learn once and never have to define again when using them. basically what i'm saying is that posting any part of my paper will just make me look like a huge douche and will probably not be interesting or helpful for anyone concerned. so yea, i drew a penis. hee hee i said penis.

      Glad.  Let's be understood: I lamed you, and was upfront with it because you were an absolute dick to Kamet.  I didn't hide.  What I find completely obnoxious was the fact that you lamed two separate entries of mine, not for lack of taste, but because of revenge.  Boo fricking hoo.  If you would take the time to look back in your comments box you'd see at least one instance where I defended you, and several where I complemented your fractured syntax and word choices.  My suggestion is to put the knives away, 'cause you're sharpening them on the wrong person.

The cake, unheeded, grew cold on the rack while they put the frosting to new and frankly rather trite use. <br/>

"Aren't you glad we used royal icing instead of the fondant?" <br/> 
"So very glad," she said as she hungrily licked up another spoonful. <br/> 
"It's a good thing there's a lot more where that came from," she said with a glint in her eye. "We have a lot more cookies to finish frosting and if you keep eating all the frosting we'll never get this done in time for the bake sale. Now stop eating it all and let's get back to work!" <br/>

      I didn't think that was an actual recipe. Like, wouldn't it not be a good idea to have the can in the oven? Wouldn't the paint on it melt and bleed some toxic shit into the chicken, or at least give it an aluminum flavor?

      Beer Can Chicken is such an old, simple, basic recipe. I mean, I can't believe people are still trying to pass it off as a recipe these days. It's the sort of thing you see in the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook at this point.

      How did I miss this thread? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Drunken chicken isn't dangerous that I know of.  It is VERY delicious in fact, and also very popular.  My parents friends and us used to have parties with drunken chicken, and I saw Lil John on TV once making it.  And I've seen/heard about it in many other places.  And I don't even live in a hick place . .. I think. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Does the recipe call for filling it half up with beer, and the other half up with barbeque sauce?

      I do not know. It is a recipe that I do not cook because I will not own beer, I do not want beer in my food, I do not want my food to taste of beer even if there is no alcohol involved. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do have to wonder if it would maybe work with another flavorful liquid in place of the beer. Perhaps an empty soda can half-filled with stock.

      When I roast a chicken (every other week or so), I do both.  A chicken is just a dead bird until you brine it.  However, if you just throw a brined bird on the pan and roast it, you don't get crispy skin all around.  Gotta prop it up, and I use a can.  I shove the can into the chicken's can.  Yes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And fuck me that chicken is good.  Something greenish, something starchish, chardonnay, simple dessert, all fuel for a long night of oral sex with no release til after the wife and I are unable to speak. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And don't forget to freeze the carcass for stock the next time you make it.

Dammit, Onstad! Why must you fuse such subtly into your comics as to make analyzing them actually meaningful, and then throw us a curveball like this? Or maybe it's just that anything after the phrase "shit-hot mother sex peppers" is just bound to be disappointing. Ugh. I need to go buy paper towels to wipe the brainsplosion off my keyboard.

Wait, that one,  <strong>Deusoma</strong> 's flashy head, is rather obtrusive too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But for the most part, there aren't a lot of people involved who could get alienated. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Really, I am glad for you that you got an app that creates animated gifs.  But the entire community will be happier if you find something static and stick with it.

      I think the point is that it existed as a word in the world at large prior to being used in Achewood as onomatopoeia or otherwise, so it did not transition into being a word.

      Also, much has changed in your absence. It would be cute and nostalgic to have an argument you over the exact nature of an onomatopoeia in panel 9 or Ray's expression in panel 3, but we do not talk about the comic here. Perhaps you would like to argue about feminism, politics, or musical tastes instead?

      Nah. It's just perception. When you're reading through a strip's archives, especially one with a large backlog like Achewood, the strips seem better on the whole because if one sucks, hey, click "next" and there's another one right there! <br/> 
 <br/> 
But once you get current the bar is raised because each time you read a new strip you have to wait a day or two or (in the case of Achewood) a week for a new one. It makes the less satisfactory strips stand out in your memory more plus you are frustrated with having to look at the unfunny strip for hours or days on end waiting for a new one.

      I'm sometimes bad on this board but if you look at my posts in this thread I'm not trying to get pity or even really talk about my problems.  I mean basically I'm just describing myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wouldn't describe myself as really emo though.  I mean I do not have the fashion of an emo.  And I don't really complain in real life either.  And emo is a noun by the way.  I had an argument with someone who said that it can only be an adjective.  No.  English words can be more than one part of speech.

      There are lots of ways to build self-worth. Relying on other people to constantly supply it by being addicted to a communication medium where you're provided almost instant interaction... probably not the best way. I understand Depression can be out of your control my friend, but it also can cause you to bend your environment to perpetuate the way you're feeling. Which is ironic because most of the ways you're trying to avoid the way you're feeling make you feel better for a short time.

      When you constantly ask people for reassurance that they like you, it will make you feel a bit better about your depression for a short amount of time. Unfortunately it also makes you reliant on constantly asking for reassurance. Long-term plans for boosts to self-esteem are better than short-term ones. Especially if they start to make you seem whiny.

      Yea, I hated the Friends one. It was 'accurate' but it was also an annoying kind of 'I'm so cool' contrarianism where you take an opposing position just because you know that a lot of people you associate with have a general consensus the other way. Yes, Randall, all nerdy guys who want relationships to build gradually are actually opportunistic assholes and girls are totally justified in dating douchebag jocks. Everyone should totally just go around directly hitting on people all the time. You are so cool for realizing this when all the people who read your site probably think differently.

      I disagree with your analysis of the strip. The problem with the "Friends" approach as the character discusses it is that it is passive-agressive and depends on concealing his feelings and capitalizing on the loneliness that he somehow expects this girl to eventually arrive at, thus making it possible for him to make a move without making it obvious that he's making a move. I didn't think that it was a justification of the girl's actions. I just thought it was a setup of the guy's final line, which derives ironic humor by him saying he respects her, when clearly his planned method of developing a relationship with her shows that he does not respect her. And I don't buy that most people who read his site actually think the whole "be friends until you're vulnerable thing" actually works on an intellectual level. Or at least I hope not. <br/>

      Nah, I think you're being too charitable. Yes, you could just read the character as that specific guy who is thinking those specific things and thus should be disapproved of, but clearly he was making a larger statement about  <em>most</em>  guys who are in similar situations. What he describes as "opportunistic waiting until the girl is vulnerable", someone else might just as accurately describe as "building trust and friendship until the girl realizes how good of a connection you have." But no, he clearly states at the beginning that the guy should just "ask her out and move on", as if people are just fucking commodities and relationships should be initiated in the same way as business transactions. And why exactly is it just assumed that the girl is unhappy after they do get together? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course this is not to say he's inaccurate. It's how accurate he is that pisses me off. But that doesn't mean it's a good way for things to be or that he's right in defending it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I were writing the comic I would take it in the other direction and call for a general strike by nerdy guys to cut off all platonic contact with girls and deprive them of their "reliable guy friend that I'm not really attracted to" sources until they re-evaluate their priorities.

You know, it doesn't really matter which way he's portraying it. You know why? <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Because doing that doesn't work.</strong>  Period. Sometimes it  <em>happens</em> , yes. Comes out of the friendship naturally. But when you begin a friendship  <em>with the eventual goal of moving on to a more intimate relationship</em>  it just plain doesn't work.

      Well it's not so much that you're beginning Thing A with the intent to change it into Thing B at some point. It's more like you start off with just basic human interaction and then try to move it to a point where the other person is comfortable enough around you and hopefully attracted enough to you that something romantic will ensue. I don't understand how it could work any other way, or this idea that people should just immediately declare their intentions like a buyer at an auction.

      Yea, I know. I guess I just always assumed that most girls are not slutty and would like to get to know you somewhat before they decide to do stuff with you, even if they do find you attractive initially. I should probably stop assuming that though.

      You know you can ask girls out on dates. You can do that. That's a thing you can do. You don't have to go up to them and start dancing on their ass and then be all "You want to get out of here." Because most of the time you do that thing at parties. And sometimes you don't meet women at parties. You sometimes will meet women at the laundromat or at the supermarket. You don't have to get freaky on aisle three.

      But like does it have to be an obvious "I'm asking you out on a date specifically for romantic purposes" thing? I just don't see how that wouldn't be weird. I always imagined that you sort of just start a conversation from mutual interests and then make non-specific plans to hang out.

      Most women like the direct approach.  There are a zillion layers of subtlety to asking a girl out on a date though.  It can come across as "I cordially invite you to be penetrated in an awkward way" to something really flattering.  You also don't get to just walk up to a total stranger and ask.  There is a dance to it.  You do A, she does B, you smile for 5 seconds and ask C, she brushes her hair out of her face and says D...  Pretty tricky shit.  Romance works well on women you already know a bit, but you gotta be forward about your intentions pretty early on.  Many women feel duped when a guy is nice to them then ends up wanting to date them.  If it started as purely friendly, but you changed your mind, say so.  Women like a man who says what he wants (and Zapatos). <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the comic was eerily accurate.  The guy wanted to date her from the start, but really wanted the action to come from her side, so he tried to entice her into coming onto him in a moment of weakness.  That's pretty uncool, but super common.  Many guys aren't comfortable being the aggressor.

 <br/> 
This is what I don't get, why do they feel duped? Presumably the point of going on a couple of dates with a guy before you let him bone you is that you're seeing whether he's an interesting person that you have anything in common with. But how the hell is that different from hanging out as friends? Like if someone's proven themselves over time to be an interesting person and they're someone that you could see yourself being physically attracted to, why are they automatically disqualified just because they didn't immediately announce that they wish to bone you? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am the guy in the comic, and I don't see how anything I do is creepy or "uncool". I don't see how I "don't respect" the girl by presuming that she is a complicated person who doesn't make decisions superficially and that I need to prove myself worthy and compatible before asking her whether she'd be interested in anything romantic, or that she's not some 19th century waif who needs me to play the part of the big strong aggressive man. The problem seems to be that I respect women  <em>too much</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
If women feel "duped", they shouldn't. It's not some insult to your dignity that a guy whom you found cool enough to spend a lot of time with also thinks you're attractive and wants to be closer to you. What  <em>is</em>  insulting is subdividing guys into two different classes and feeling offended when one dares to try to rise above the little role you've placed him into. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize that you guys are clearly right and I'm clearly wrong in the sense of what works and what doesn't, but I'm saying that this is not a good way for things to be, and we don't need to be smug little assholes about it like he was being in that strip.

      I think the issue is that unspoken attraction adds an uncomfortable layer to everyday  interaction.  She might feel she has to watch what she says around you.  If she mentions someone she's dating or has a thing for, will that hurt your feelings?  If she jokes about sex or compliments you on something, is she leading you on?  These worries may impede the relaxation people expect to have when hanging with friends.  Neither women nor men enjoy these situations (and it's not as though women never try to pull this scheme). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Traditional dating does allow a couple to get to know each other gradually, but it also prevents one person from intruding upon the other's private life completely, allowing for less clouded judgement and more chilled-out times.

      Yea, I see what you're saying. It's just that "asking someone out" in the traditional sense always seemed like a paradox to me. If you don't really know each other that well, why would you even want to ask them out, and why would they say yes? Asking someone out when you don't know that much about each other seems to me the equivalent of saying "you're hot and I want to have sex with you", because that's clearly the only thing you have to go off. On the other hand, if you do get to know each other beforehand, you're likely friends by that time, and we're back to the situation in the comic.

      Forgive my presumption, but it sounds like you've been thinking of a date as similar to hanging out with a friend: that is, an outing where you expect to have a good time with someone you like, but with sex at the end.  Sadly, one cannot expect either of a date  <em>a priori</em> .   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rather, the function of a date is to get to know someone better in a situation that has clear spatial and temporal limits.  The primary point isn't to enjoy her company, it's to figure out whether you enjoy her company.  Liking the person, having a good time, and sex are all things that may or may not result from this process.  It's a little more difficult than just hanging out with a large group of people that includes her, but it pays off for the reasons I mentioned in my first post. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This may seem like kind of an unpleasant process, but it's a great way to find out about bars your friends haven't heard of.

      It does sound pretty unpleasant. In fact it sounds like a job interview. And it seems to me that the way someone would act under such circumstances is so far removed from what they are really like as a person that you would not be able to make any sort of effective judgment about whether you enjoy their company. But I guess that's just me.

      Yeah, man. As you will find out, bad dates will present you with some of the most novel situations of your life. Good dates are rare and awesome, of course. But bad ones are pretty incredible, too, if you can appreciate the absurdity of the world and don't mind staring directly into it's terrible, terrible face for a couple of hours every once in awhile.

      I had bad date also. I never actually dated much anyway. This was worse than no date at all. This was after my disaster of a 1st marriage crashed and burned. Depressing before, during and after. I've moved back from Tulsa, got a 1/2 ton truck, building up a business, living in a cheap apartment. <br/> 
 I get some telemarketer type call one evening. <br/> 
 This is before Internet, but still is valuable lesson. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 The caller's voice is petite, sexy, and she's definitely hitting on me. <br/> 
 I'm like "huh?"  <br/> 
You always build mental image to go with voice. This is punchline foreshadowing. Somehow we're talking about doing a movie, maybe dinner after. <br/> 
I'm "okay, why not?  What's to lose?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't go there, Ray, is danger signs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Okay, go pick her up at her house 6:00 in Moore. Park truck by curb, go up to door, ring bell. This gigantic female person, not tall, but wide. Maybe 350, 400 lbs? comes to door.  <br/> 
I'm thinking, "Oh shit, must be Sister." <br/> 
I say, "Is Nita here?" <br/> 
Charming voice comes out of giant blob person. She says, (of course) "You must be Vlad. <br/> 
 I'll get a sweater." <br/> 
She is so ugly. Uglier than baboon in pickle factory. Most charming, chirpy voice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
She gets in pickup, springs GROAN and cab sags. Oh my. This is God laughing at my sorry ass. Haha, very funny, Mr. Asshole!  <br/> 
We go to movie, sit like 2 statues. There is no conversing because she is also stupid like bag of bricks.  <br/> 
 I take home. Pickup truck sags again, this time with relief. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Next day, I tell my friend Scott who is working for me. <br/> 
Scott laughs his ass off too. Scott and God, they laugh.

      Wow. Now I think that dating is like 4Chan. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I lucked out. I basically skipped dating and moved directly into relationship. We had the summer together so we got to spend a lot of time together without going out on discrete "dates" and then during that first year I was away college the whole time. By the time it came around again we were living in dorms next to each other and she basically just always hung out in my room because I had my own private suite.

      Oh biff, I'm loving on you in many ways here.  He is hilarious when talking about nerdy things, not so much when he's talking about nerds.  He was positively AWFUL for the first good while of making the strip, then got funny, then even better.  Except when he's really going after it with relationship or culture. <br/>

And he can burn in ever-raping hell for mocking Anathem.  The premise of that book has left me erect since September.

      He had a point about Anathem though. I, for some reason, got it from the library and realized I wouldn't have the time to finish it and get it back in time and since it was on request from tons of other people I couldn't re-check it so I never actually read it, but just looking at the inside of the dust jacket he made up too damn many new words for it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Frank Herbert had kind of a point to it in Dune, but even then he also made up too damn many new words. It was a great book, but I shouldn't need to be flipping back to the glossary every few seconds to find out what some fairly unimportant word means. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At least Trainspotting taught me about Scottish slang and expressions. I also eventually managed to read through the accent. Still, that was maybe not so great an idea. I can see what he was doing, but it was, well, not needed. I can imagine accents, I don't really need to read them unless you're trying to make very specific points regarding timing and inflection that is relevant to the conversation.

      This was a point of contention for me and my thesis advisor. I was writing a sort of sci-fi and fantasy novel and he basically told me I wasn't making up enough new words and I shouldn't be explaining what they mean to my readers. And I was like "But I'm sick of all the neologisms in sci fi and fantasy. That's like the main reason I only watch anime" and that made him groan because he just doesn't think there is any anime that ascends to the level of literature like science fiction. He told me to read  <em>Neuromancer</em>  and so I started to read it but I was like, "Look, I just can't get through this. He's got all this new technology, most of which is dated by now anyway, but he's got seven slang terms in a sentence that provides no context" and he would smugly smile like "Hey that's how  <em>real science fiction is</em>  buddy" and I'm all "But we can do better than that" and he's like "Yes we can!" and I'm all "So let's go back to what I was doing" and he's all "NoOoOo!!!" and I'm all "FuUuUcK!"

      Are you... are you ragging on Neuromancer? <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's a time and a place and a limit for neologisms. In some cases it makes sense and it's not too hard to work out. When you talk about cyberspace or being represented by an avatar it's not too hard to work out and it's one of a very small number of new slang terms that are needed to define the nature of the world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When you come up with totally pointless new words to explain things that can already be said with regular words or you come up with new words and concepts that aren't really needed that's when you cross the line. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your advisor was a douche though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Worst neologism I can immediately think of: "muggle". Totally awful word that sounds incredibly stupid and never needed to be invented. Everyone else has been saying "mundane" for years and year and years in all sorts of fantasy and sci-fi to similarly refer to people who are not part of the special group that is part of the book. No need to invent the god-damned stupidest thing possible to explain the same concept. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have hella issues with how Harry Potter sucks though.

      That is so on the mark that I can barely stand it. <br/>

Since we're giving it to pop-punk  <em>bullshit</em>  straight up can we also take a moment to acknowledge how much damage Green Day has done? <br/> 
 <br/> 
When the final book came out it actually got to me a little bit. These things took a while to come out. These kids actually grew up with this. It's totally a thing in that way (as opposed to just a general cultural trend which was a different sort of thing). It took ten years to be fully published. If you started reading when you were ten or so or even if you started a bit after they'd already come out you are now a late teen. I fear for what this will mean in the future. <br/> 
 <br/> 
His Dark Materials, while a bit interesting, didn't get me going either. I feel like it just started getting... weird and disjointed after the first book. By the third I was just reading it to finish it rather than actually caring.

      I was in the wrong in my earlier comment. I wasn't reading  <em>Neuromancer</em> ; I think the problem was I was actually reading  <em>Count Zero</em>  because my thesis advisor seemed to think that it is possible to read and understand it without reading  <em>Neuromancer</em>  first, but I started  <em>Neuromancer</em>  and I found it a lot easier to get the context. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I enjoyed  <em>Harry Potter</em> , but I can understand your criticisms of it. It would have made more sense if "muggle" was actually supposed to be a bigoted slur, but the only bigoted slur was "mudblood." I think "squib" was supposed to be one too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also didn't like how at times Rowling's prose seemed tailor-made to the action movie adaptations that eventually came, and I thought Harry himself was the blandest character in the series.

      Rowling absolutely ruined  <em>Harry Potter</em>  in the fifth book.  Absofuckinglutely ruined it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Spoiler Alert!!!</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sirius gave Harry a gift at Christmas, a mirror that Harry could always use to talk to Sirius, without detection or interruption.  But Harry threw a snit, and never opened the gift. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Later, after Christmas, Harry needed to talk to Sirius.  In order to do this, he had to sneak into the Headmistress' office, and use her fireplace's Floo network connection,  <em>at great risk to himself and to his friends</em> , to talk to Sirius. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Later Harry uses her office a second time to talk to Sirius, and gets caught, causing no amount of trouble for himself and his friends. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even later, Harry gets Sirius killed, because he believes Sirius has been captured by Voldemort.  He tries to contact Sirius, again by the Floo network, but the house elf lies to him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sirius would not have died if Harry had been able to talk to him before the raid on the Ministry of Magic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only problem is, Harry had in his possession a tool that he could use at any time to talk to Sirius without interruption or detection.  He was just too much of a big baby to know he had it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The flaw in the story is this:  The first time Harry contacts Sirius using the Floo network, the first thing out of Sirius' mouth would have been: "Why aren't you using the mirror I gave you?"  But he doesn't say this.  Why?   <em>Solely so Rowling will have the necessary plot elements in place at the end of the book to kill him.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is complete and utter bullshit.  This totally turned me off on the series.  This totally turned me off on Rowling.  This is inexcusable amateurish nonsense, and she should be embarrassed for the rest of her life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah, yeah, I know, she is richer than the queen.  But to hell with her anyway, for her authorial bullshit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All she had to do was to leave the walkie-talkie mirror out of the story.  But nooooo.  She had to put it in to add pathos to an already pathetic character. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Crap crap crap. <br/>

      Yeah I didn't like the idea that there was some type of death portal in the wizarding world. It made no sense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The fifth book is probably the most depressing book in the series. It is the Empire Strikes Back of the Harry Potter universe, except less awesome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hated the way she ended the series, I felt like if she had shortened the books some she could have easily kept up the series for 10 books and had everything after the 6th book just be Harry exploring the Wizarding World looking for Horcruxes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The thing I hate about Rowling is she created this expansive, beautiful universe and yet refuses to do much to explore it.

It's not so good when you're getting it from the library because, well, why am I going to blow $30 (!!!!) on a new hardcover when I can get the same exact thing from the library for free? I can't even afford paperbacks right now. Then you're in a race to finish it in time to get it back before it's due and you can't re-check it because there are holds on it.

      I don't know what you are talking about with the furries.  A lot of anime fans though. <br/> 
That is very annoying by the way, but that's pretty much only with the comic discussion threads, which are usually a drag.  Sometimes I liven them up (see: this latest one).  Most of the other forums are cool.

      One  <em>rack</em>  of nine ball, me thinks.  The rack is in the standard spot.  The hundo is on the rail.  You cover it with another, you play, the winner picks both up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's a reference to Ray and Connie's ongoing, never-ending, Connie tries to be merciful, but sometimes he backslides, like when the Mini needs a new clutch, Ray always loses, pool tournament.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray is angling to make sure that Connie can refuse him no more, when...  When he racks the nine balls and puts the hundo on the rail.

      So you don't care about clits and you can't spot it when a lady fakes it? Wow. I guess you're still young though. I'm sure you'll get better at spotting when a lady is faking it in the future. You just need more practice. ;) <br/>

I never understood why someone would fake. The correct manner is to educate. Why reinforce someone doing something badly and not get off? It basically makes the world a worse place and specifically your little part of it.

      The way to tell a fake orgasm is that it looks like something you might see in porn.  Good orgasms look very undignified. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The best way to spot a real one is that she makes you breakfast afterward without being asked.

      Another way to tell is if she tells you without being asked. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or if she says something like "I already came, you can finish whenever you want."

      Sometimes it can be tough because you think it happened, but then she keeps going at it and you start to wonder if maybe it was only the appearance of it happening. Only later do you find out that she was trying for a double.

      Um, can't you tell from the muscle spasms?  The muscle spasms in the vagina that come with the orgasm? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Can't fake that, as far as I know. <br/>

And anyway, a woman who fakes orgasms deserves all the orgasms she gets.

      Agreed on the fakers. Not all ladies are spasming that much. Also, sometimes ladies... they no come so easily without much clitoral stimulation. In this case other method is likely best. No way to feel spasms as easily.

      Definitely. Sometimes they may also use implements expressly designed to help them with the rubbing. Perhaps while fucking them. In some cases this is helpful. When the rubbing stops she is likely done

      Those spasms can indeed be faked. The muscle can be clenched and unclenched just like the anus, so they just have to do it sort of non-rhythmically.

      Not always. Sometimes with ladies they get first run in and they are tired. No longer interested in playing double-header. They have had their fill. Perhaps they get really super-sensitive afterwards and playing more, it is painful for them. They no want to keep it going. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wish I had lady that made enough noise to be worth moving. Is barely enough noise to be heard on other side of bed. When lady is loud enough to be heard down the block is perhaps a bit inconsiderate, but you can go out and hold head high. Everybody knows that you are main man of the neighborhood.

 <br/> 
"Always with the schtupping at all hours," said apartment 2-B occupant Rose Teitelbaum, a retiree who has lived in this building since before you were born. "In my day, such a thing, it was shameful, a scandal. It is like a bordello, I am telling you. Such a racket! And unmarried, nu?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Teitelbaum, whose bed is directly below Kafka and Brown's bathroom, site of their 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. sexual encounters, said the whole neighborhood is talking, and that she fears some days even to show her face for the embarrassment of having such flagrant and indiscreet young persons living in this, her building, where her own mother taught her so many years ago to show respect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"For this%u2013the gasping, the thrusting, the pounding, the shouting in the middle of night%u2013I pay taxes for 53 years?" Teitelbaum said. "Thank heaven my hearing is not so good as what it used to be, or I wouldn't get one wink of sleep with all the oohing and the aahing and the screaming like the gorillas in the jungle."

      Girl makes love moans. But they could be lies of heart. How to tell? They fake all over the place! But they never fake all over  <em>your face</em> . So to do: Take legs in both hands and spread apart. Make tongue get up close and personal. Be down with swirl. Yes? Moans will come. Take into memory. Bide time. Then return to lady another evening when love moans are in order. Take legs in both hands and spread apart. But this time do not introduce tongue. It is new friend: your lower fine time. Make him go. Then later, moans come. You listen. You compare to before. They same, she loves you. They different. You slit her throat. Cast her bones out of home like so much spoiled potatoes. Find new woman.

      Warm clothing is unpleasant. I want the weather to stay above 70 at all times. No snow ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sadly it's almost never over 70 here. When it is people complain that it's too hot. The summer is freakishly cold. The winter, at least, is pretty tolerable. It almost never goes under below 50. The problem is that year-round we basically move from 53 to maybe 68. <br/>

Weather is a huge deal to me living somewhere. Sadly most of the places with decent weather are also pretty terrible places to live. I will never understand why cool places formed in places with awful weather.

      If you have not been to the top of a snow-covered mountain and traveled at breakneck speed down a narrow path between rows of towering evergreens completely encased in frost, then stopped in an area of the trail where there were no people going by and no signs or lift cables to remind you of civilization, and just taken it all in for a few minutes, then you have not really lived. I am completely serious about this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cold weather lends itself well to solitude and contemplation. Warm weather means people walking around in large groups, clad in skimpy clothing and uncalled-for smiles, lounging around having 'fun' and filling the air with needless chatter. I fie upon it, I fie with all my being.

      I dislike cold weather very much. I don't like typical warm clothes. I find them confining and unpleasant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also dislike nature. I do not want to be out in nature. I also will not ski. I am afraid of getting on the lift. This has been discussed previously. I also find that it is too much of a physical activity. Totally not my bag. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Skimpy clothing, however, that is definitely my thing. I remember back in May it was actually warm for once. Everyone wanted to take advantage of it or at least take respite from it as nobody has air conditioning. Girls were wearing filmy, flimsy sun dresses or scant tops. It was wonderful. It was warm and I lounged in the park listening to music. It was not so nice to be outside in the sun so much (must not get tan!), but it was warm and enjoyable.

      I guess that depends on your definition of "find a flaw in his argument." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will never ski.  Theoretically I would enjoy it, but the subsequent extended hospital stay attempting to recover from the damage to my congenitally defective knee would be quite a price to pay. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Therefore, according to his argument, I will never live. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have done other fun and exciting things in my life.  Rappelling down a cliff face, hanging between earth and sky, nothing between me and disaster but a slender rope, facing up to my fear of heights, I think that qualifies as living. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I didn't have to be cold to do it.

      Well, that's certainly comparable. I was mainly referring to the general feeling of danger and natural solitude. Besides, not being able to is one thing, but not seeing the worth of it is another. There are plenty of things that I lack the skill or ability to do, and I recognize that in this sense, I am missing out on a dimension of experience.

I have read a number of ideas on how with functional immortality, but still the ability to be killed normally people would become very paranoid. <br/>

David Lapham was intending to work on a comic about this concept, but it never seemed to get off the ground. Of course, he's put Stray Bullets on more or less permanent hiatus too and with only one issue left to finish the damn arc. I mean, he has steady work now so at least do the last issue of the arc before hanging it up for a while.

      ditto. i've gone through some bad times. sometimes i get the same feeling when i read beef, and then immediately after i get sort of angry because beef's depression is somewhat of a gimmick. he hangs out with a group of dudes who involve him in all sorts of hijinks. some of them are willing to spare him a lung, build him a glass chamber with incubator arms just so he'll hang out, or set everything up like Cheers, and it's like dang, beef, how are you still gonna be depressed? what you got to be depressed about? you're just plain ungrateful. if i had a kind and funny lady to take care for me and a bunch of doggs who understood and accommodated my strange cares (i mean yea they rag but it is out of Fondness) i would be hella satisfied.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i don't know why i said all that. it is likely because i am jealous of a cartoon cat.  <br/>

oh, but G-G is awesome. it is raw. it made me realize why i had such conflicting feelings about Garfield before-- Garfield was the only thing that sucked about Garfield.

      Exactly. It was just a late-60s reactionary Afro-Centric creation. It would be like creating a fake feminist holiday and claiming that Christmas was the holiday of the patriarchy and women needed their own special holiday at the same basic time to celebrate being a woman instead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I celebrate, well, I used to celebrate Mythmas, but I believe the phrasing that's taking over very rapidly now is Squidmas though I can't quite pin it down. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I grew up never celebrating holidays with anyone outside my immediate family and holidays were never a family thing in that regard. To me the true meaning of Mythmas is that I get presents. It's basically my birthday, but in December and it's also everybody else's birthday too. That's exactly what I want out of a holiday.

Is not Santa Claus massive male figure? Paternal oppressor deciding if people are good or bad as only a man is allowed to do so? Even with his beard he celebrates the masculine secondary-sexual characteristics! "Mrs." Claus? She is nothing. She is housewife with no value. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What goes under tree? BOXES! Man is saying that wymyn are inferior to his own phallic nature by placing his "presents" under the symbol of his oppression which he refers to with a slur designed to cement his own power. They are something to be "unwrapped". His "present" because that is how men see wymyn. As a gift that they will undress and then enjoy. Something to be given to them by their male figurehead who enables the all-encompassing gynoppression inherent in the holiday.

      I never really believed in Santa. My friends wouldn't believe me though. Who is to be having laugh at the last?! HA-HA! <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I had a child I would not tell them that Santa was real. I think it is a sick and cruel thing to do to a child to lie to them just because you think it's cute. I have heard people say that they think it's OK because kids really get into it and it's harmless, but these same people get really pissed when you tell kids the truth and don't indulge them in perpetuating a lie. I don't see the problem. Is it really so bad for a child to know that their parents love them very much and buy them presents? Isn't a parent's love better than a million fake Santas and years of being lied to? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Children deserve to know the truth.

      The way it worked in USSR was kind of weird. Santa was called Grandfather Frost, and everything we associate with Christmas was carried over to New Years. Instead of leaving presents under the tree and telling you it was Santa, your parents would take you to some place in the area where he was appearing, and he would greet you and hand you the presents that your parents had given to him. Or sometimes if a bunch of parents got together and had a New Years party for the children they'd get him to actually show up at the house. The point being that it was always out in the open instead of a secret thing, and I'm not sure if anyone ever fully bought into the whole supernatural belief. Plus, there was always the notion that your parents were behind it, at least in the sense that they were the ones taking you to see Santa or getting him to come. Which is good, because kids should learn to be grateful to their parents for the shit they're getting and not some mythical creature.

      Yeah, if it's just part of the ceremony then that's totally cool. It's the willful intent to convince children that he is real when they know otherwise and then getting astoundingly angry whenever someone might let a child in that they've been lying to them that bothers me. <br/>

      But do you agree that Scrooged is awesome? So far it's the only one of the three Christmas movies I enjoy (Nightmare Before Christmas and A Christmas Story) that hasn't yet been totally ruined. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember watching A Christmas Story as a kid in the 80s when it was still a once a year thing. Now it just gets put on a lot of the time because there's nothing else on TV and I know they're running it all damn day. Yeah, it's ruined as a result, but I still can derive a thin, watery enjoyment from it.

      There is an easy solution to this. It is so easy that I do not understand why people complain about this "problem". When you would like to watch  <em>A Christmas Story</em> , watch it once. Change the channel or turn off the TV when it comes on again. See how easy that was? <br/>

Seriously though, I have never watched Wonderful Life all the way through, though this is more my fault and not the movie's. I either watch up until he tries to jump or after he sees what life is like if he was dead. <br/>

      Actually, my whole point was that I was originally just joking. I find it kind of odd that people kept making it into a big thing with what really happened. He played a cop in both and they were both around the same time. <br/>

Yeah, I did look it up as soon as someone said it, but it's not relevant to my joking. I do not think any person seriously believed  <em>Family Matters</em>  to be a spin-off from  <em>Die Hard</em> . <br/>

      NO IT WASN'T. In the continuum of classic TGIF shows, Step By Step was EASILY the worst, and there was another show with an uncle character that was a football player that was horrible too. <br/>

The best was Boy Meets World and Dinosaurs though, followed by the one-season classic Teen Angel.

Boy Meets World predates Degrassi and most modern teen sitcoms by doing the "very special" episodes (yes I know other sitcoms before BMW did it too), and they did it so well too. The episode where Shaun's dad dies still gets me today, I'm even tearing up now thinking about. And then they totally made fun of that formula with that one Halloween episode.

      Technically Degrassi as a series started in '80, but even Degrassi High started in '89 while Boy Meets World wasn't on until '93. I can't believe that it was on until '00 though. I simply cannot imagine it going on that long. I was definitely past the proper age to watch it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Blossom, as well, as the canonical answer for "very special" and it started in '91. Boy Meets World was simply, it appears, your exposure to "very special", but it does not seem to objectively be so.

      No, that's Next Generation, it's a new thing. Apparently the original Degrassi was just a Canadian thing. I don't think it aired in the US. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, Blossom is the main source for "very special episode". Nobody ever says, jokingly, "a very special episode of  <em>Boy Meets World</em> ". Always it is  <em>Blossom</em> . <br/>

I wasn't certain on the chronology, but a quick check on Wikipedia fixed the dates and gave me the solid data I wanted to back up my own beliefs.

      Tekende did not realize at first that George Harrison had been replaced by Carl Winslow because  <em>he is colorblind and does not see race</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>* ~ * <em>Black America's feelings on this asset are: hold up.</em><br/>
<br/>
The ideal of "colorblindness" only has appeal to those that feel racial desegregation requires cultural assimilation. While the ideal of a 'post-racial' figure is encouraging because it shows there is a viable means for members of minority groups to achieve success (see: President-Elect Barack Obama), freedom of expression includes cultural modalities as well. In the melting pot, care must be taken to ensure that we do not overwhelm the taste of the spice with the texture of the seasoning.<br/>

      <em>Scrooge</em>  with Albert Finney.  Saw that one in the theater the year it came out.  I was eight. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still love to watch it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The one with Bill Murray is also good, but it is a completely different kind of movie. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have still never seen  <em>A Christmas Story.</em>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And to answer the question of how can I have missed it when it is so ubiquitous, I do not watch TV. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I may watch it some day, but I don't feel any urge to see it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And  <em>Christmas Vacation</em> ?  Someone would have to get all Ludovico on me to get me to watch that.

At one time this was awesome, but in recent years is not so good a thing. <br/>

Why can't he go all Bill Murray and make good films now though. I didn't see  <em>Shopgirl</em>  though, but it might have had promise. His other work is generally good, but his films... it is clear that this is a man with an art problem.

      I do not like it. I do not like "feel good" type films. I do not like Jimmy Stewart and I do not like Frank Capra. It is basically worst-ever movie for me. This is not entirely true, but I have very strong negative feelings about it.

      Yes, but it's not nearly as college-freshman snarky and insolent. <br/>

I also tend to hear more people saying "Giftmas" when they're trying to impugn the holiday as being overly commercial.

      No, Squidmas is a real thing. I've been trying to track it down on Google and such since I heard about it a few weeks ago. It seems like it has something to do vaguely with Cthulhu and it's made it big on the Internet as the new atheist term for a holiday that takes place on Dec. 24 where you get gifts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think I said it elsewhere, but I'm not yet up on exactly what the deal is. People keep saying it, but I can't find the point of origin or any explanation as to what exactly it is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Saturnalia is not related, but I wanted to include another holiday you skipped that was important to me. I was in Latin club in high school and I still have a lot of residual effects from that. A lot of my current non-local friends (and girlfriend) were also in it so it's been reinforced over the years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, Saturnalia was wicked-awesome.

      Eh, it was basically a main thing of the geeks I went to school with. The Latin teacher was also pretty awesome. We rarely did any actual things relating to the language and getting better at it so much as more cultural things. <br/>

Besides, as I said, I met the girl I've been dating for the past eight, close to nine years as a result. You can't say anything about it to make me feel like a loser.

      Oy. About the guy with the Soviet avaticon and smarmy attitude. Not your smarm, not hedonismbot's marm. <br/> 
 Do a search on him in the thread and you find his earlier post I'm referring to, which in turn refers to another guy, the Czech, in a way I thought was  dipshittish. You are knowink this term, Okie? <br/> 
 Basically, I doubt he intended offense with stupid avaticon, but it was retarded all the same. <br/>

      I think it was right placement, even if obscure. I may be gettink my senile on, but not here, not now.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Howwayver, you are now makink me very sorry I am commenting this drivel and annotatink with more drivel. <br/> 
My comment, it was referencing tekende's 'meh' of the guy and indirectly also tgh's ditto of that 'meh' with my own ditto of both of them. <br/> 
 This was a direct 'meh' by tekende, not implied according to assetbarrista. Therefore the hearsay motion is overruled. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I rest my case with this, also note the assetbarrista redirect of  <em>his</em>  comment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>You should just end every comment with "I am Czech." I'd smile. </em></div>   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you need Belgand for further parsing, I have him on retainer. Fwiw, I had originally intended to comment directly to that "smiling" comment with some snark about smiling Soviet tanks whenever he posted it.....then deleted that.

      <em>Princess Bride</em>  is easily one of my favorite movies of youth, right up there with  <em>The Sandlot</em>  and it easily surpasses  <em>Neverending Story</em>  as far as fantasy movies from that time period go. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think every film adaptation of a novel should feature characters actually reading the book. <br/>

      Ahh...... then there is a bug in assetbarrista that default points arbitrarily to some post random distance above or below a post that is  <em>ignored</em>  if that post was the actual original re: value.  <br/>

What i was trying to say was that you shouldn't want to rush into it. i only actually dated two girls in high school, both of them senior year and I never actually got to know them i just wanted a girlfriend. who am I with now is someone i actually took the time to get to know, granted it was over a couple days before I was like HOLY SHIT THIS IS AN AWESOME GIRL but still, I took the time. <br/>

      It is.  But then again I've never wanted one.  I  <em>have</em>  had boyfriends.  But I thought perhaps you would feel better thinking that someone else hadn't had a girlfriend.  I see now that it was an error to think that the fact that I, in my mid-50's, have never had a girlfriend would be at all reassuring for a young man.  Fool that I am, I apologize.

      I think we should have waited and Redphillip could have shown SJE how much fun can be had without having girlfriends. I say... a moderately-sized valise in this case. Don't want to overly frighten the young one, but you want to give him a good taste of the breadth of experiences available. <br/>

      I think Stellas are intensely temperamental and kind of easy to fuck up. I don't get 'em often (if I'm gonna splurge it's probably gonna be on a nice dunkel or a decent pale ale), but when I do I never really know what's in store for me. I mean, in bottles it's pretty consistently above average, but the last time I ordered one at a restaurant I was convinced that they had given me a High Life or something instead. Not that I have a problem with H.L., but it's a lot cheaper than Stella. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end, they're usually pretty good. Just not as nice as Ray would have us believe.

      I agree heartily. I just bought the Trader Joe's Vintage ale for 2008 and it was dirt cheap for a 750ml bottle and kills Stella in so many ways. But if offered, I think I'd always accept.

      They seem to be fairly popular in the Bay Area. Whenever I'm out at a place you will almost never, ever see the main domestic beers (Budweiser, Miller, etc.) available as you do in other places I have lived. Typically you'll see Stella, Anchor Steam (since it's brewed in town), Sierra Nevada and a few others such as Red Hook, Peroni, or Amstel making common appearances.
