      Running in this situation has to be a panic thing, I mean, the main reason you might logically flee is because you are afraid they will blame you, but they know you had the only damn ticket this is not complicated. Still, I can't blame Ray.

      How can you not understand it? Ray attends a sort of avant garde performance piece, attends dinner afterwards with the surreal performer, then the performer accidentally kills himself, though notes left after his death convey Ray to a house where, after having his photo taken and passing out, it's revealed that the whole thing is some elaborate prank, or else dinner and what comes after is merely another act in the piece. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At least, that's what I got from it.

      These comments are sort of like the special features. Or, rather, perhaps one could more aptly consider Assetbar the editor's analysis at the end of a particularly engaging translation of a Gogol novel. You don't watch the special features before you watch the DVD, and by that token you shouldn't read Assetbar comments before you read Achewood as a whole. Of COURSE you'll get spoiled; heck, half these comments are either overarching analysis or tired, rehashed rephrasings of punchlines. It'll cheapen the joke when you actually READ "I put the other player's body in my van / and I am the winner" if you've seen it in hundreds of Assetbar comments already.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Moral of this story: if this is your first read-through and you are reading the Assetbar comments, do yourself a favor and stop. Put down the Assetbar, go back to the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417070815/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=09202005">main page</a> , and enjoy Achewood like the celebration of the English language that it is: uninterrupted by the boorish musings of the vox populi you find here. As funny/insightful as our comments may be, they really don't compare to the excellence of reading the comic itself through without them and interpreting it yourself.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, if you've gotten this far already, you don't have a particularly long way to go until the end, but still. Thought that counts, I suppose.

      Ok, so, totally agree with the above, but how much does this suck, when I was wondering whether or not I should read all of Achewood, I asked a friend who had read it, and this was their response: "Oh yeah, it has a lot of great stuff, great relationship stuff, hell, Ray even decides to break the machine at the end of the big fight so not to punch Roast Beef." <br/>
