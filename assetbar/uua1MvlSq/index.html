      I always wondered why Snakes and Ladders is called Chutes and Ladders in the US. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is it just that it makes more sense to slide down a chute than a snake?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or was there fear of Biblical Meaningfulness? If kids' game pieces were allowed to slide down snakes, would that be too much like the Fall of Man, when the serpent got our incestuous ancestors kicked out of the Garden?

      Wow, I had no idea it was such an old and moral game: <br/> 
 <br/> 
" <em>Snakes and Ladders originated in India as a game based on morality called Vaikuntapaali or Paramapada Sopanam (the ladder to salvation). This game made its way to England, and was eventually introduced in the United States of America by game pioneer Milton Bradley in 1943.<br/><br/><br/>The game was played widely in ancient India by the name of Moksha Patamu, the earliest known Jain version Gyanbazi dating back to 16th century. The game was called "Leela" - and reflected the Hinduism consciousness around everyday life. Impressed by the ideals behind the game, a newer version was introduced in Victorian England in 1892, possibly by John Jacques of Jacques of London.<br/>
<br/>
Moksha Patamu was perhaps invented by Hindu spiritual teachers to teach children about the effects of good deeds as opposed to bad deeds. The ladders represented virtues such as generosity, faith, humility, etc., and the snakes represented vices such as lust, anger, murder, theft, etc. The moral of the game was that a person can attain salvation (Moksha) through performing good deeds whereas by doing evil one takes rebirth in lower forms of life (Patamu). The number of ladders was less than the number of snakes as a reminder that treading the path of good is very difficult compared to committing sins. Presumably the number "100" represented Moksha (Salvation). In Andhra Pradesh, snakes and ladders is played in the name of Vaikuntapali<br/>
<br/>
The squares of virtue on the original game are Faith (12), Reliability (51), Generosity (57), Knowledge (76), Asceticism (78); the squares of evil are Disobedience (41), Vanity (44), Vulgarity (49), Theft (52), Lying (58), Drunkenness (62), Debt (69), Rage (84), Greed (92), Pride (95), Murder (73) and Lust (99).</em> " <br/>

      He is (was, since I now know how this tragic tale unfolded) fine. I enjoy reading his comments far more than the endless stream of 'omg Ray is so awesome' or 'I totally use this line in real life' or '(insert quote from previous strip)'. It doesn't need to be a love-fest all the time. The people who marked his comments as spam are truly abusing the system and sinking to a new low.

      I like reading them too, often right before laming them.  But still it is fun to read that sort of comment, so it pisses me off when people mark them as spam.  If you don't like a comment, lame it, go with a lower lame setting, or use the "ignore user" function.    Don't mark it as spam.  Have some  <em>dignity</em> .
