"Now as for temperatures, freezing or refrigerating may be popular with coffee fans but not with coffee beans. See, each time you fetch them from the chill, moisture condenses on the surface of the bean which only makes them degrade faster. Now as long as you don't stash this near the oven, room temperature will do just fine."

      From which 5th grade recess and tenderly clumsy first relationship does your unique viewpoint hail?  How does the day your former best friend Ronald showed you what rotten.com was and from which ugly girls locker did you first make plans to dethrone god and remove all lifeforms from office? I'm only asking because We, the gigantic, unthinking, unblinking, hivemind that for being a mind is still unthinking and for being unblinking is still incapable of seeing the web of banality that sustains our orbit around the center of ourselves, are curious why this brash, young, hotshot motorcycle inseminator is to busy crossbreeding motorcycles to talk like us.   <br/>

Well her jeans they get like a wet saddle blanket<br/>

She's so satisfied when she's riding and trainin'<br/>
She must love that smell of the barn, I must say<br/>
She's satisfied when she's groomin' and grainin'<br/>

      I'm thinking a 1963 Ford Falcon Futura.  Black with red vinyl interior.  Inline 6. AM Radio. No seatbelts. If it was a "hotter" model of Falcon, I don't think that good ol' boy would have ever honked at Ramses in the first place. <br/>

To me, the Falcon Futura says class.  It says "Damn if I don't want a classic piece of Detroit steel but one that won't eat a weekend putting back in shape." Slightly understated, but with a fury under the hood. <br/>

The thing is, my brother owned a Futura for a few years. The thing sounded like a bucket of doorknobs being dropped on a concrete floor when it started up, gobbled oil like a armored division racing through  <em>bocage</em> , and had...um...no seatbelts. But it's a wonderful feeling riding shotgun in a car that gets happy looks, thumbs up, and frantic "roll down the window" gestures just so 70 year old men can go "Is that a Falcon?  Damn!" wherever you go.   <br/>

You feel like you're contributing to society just by keeping such a car on the road, with young kids looking at such a strange steel rattle-trap with glazed-eye wonder, and their elders getting a faint cough stuck in their throat, thinking back to those days where they had their youth, a full tank of gas, their best girl by their side, and a crisp, clear sky stretched out before them, racing down the highway towards an azure horizon. <br/>

      Ralph Nader made his bones with the bestseller expose starring the Chevy Corvair:  <em>"Unsafe at Any Speed"</em> , iirc. But if I also remember, correctly, the Falcon was right up in the top 3 or so too. <br/>

      It is a hard question to answer. Does it even matter? Ramses is a ramblin man. Seems like the type to just take a phone whenever he needs it from whatever sumbitch gets in his way like a CIA agent or a drug kingpin who must not be traced. Is he the kind who only hangs onto a phone for a few months at a time, only programming whatever numbers he really needs into it? <br/> 
 <br/> 
But this is overthinking it. Occam's razor suggests it's Ramses' own personal phone. The question now is what does Ray have the balls to do with his father's phone number saved?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Scenario One</strong> <br/> 
 <em>Ray: Hey Dad.<br/>
<br/>
Ramses: What you want?<br/>
<br/>
Ray: Just callin to say Hi.<br/>
<br/>
Ray: All right, well you said it. Goodbye.[hangs up]</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Scenario Two</strong> <br/> 
 <em>Ray: Dad I am in a sitch I am in need of help real bad.<br/>
<br/>
Ramses: You kick his ass yet?<br/>
<br/>
Ray: It's not that kind of problem, Dad--<br/>
<br/>
Ramses: Fuck it ain't that kind of problem. You won the Fight, you win every goddamn fight. You call me after you done kicked his ass.[hangs up]</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Scenario Three</strong> <br/> 
 <em>Ray: Hey Dad I was thinkin by the time you arrive back in town "The Wrestler" will probably be out on Blu Ray and we could watch it and discuss its themes and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Ramses: Fuck I want to see a movie bout a old fake fighter who needs drugs to win fake fights. Then he gets all boo hoo bout how he fucked up his own body and kills hisself in the damn ring.<br/>
<br/>
Ray: So you saw it? What other thoughts did you have on the movie?<br/>
<br/>
Ramses: It sucked. That Bruce Springsteen song at the end sucked worse. The man's got a billion damn dollars and he's still writing songs about some imaginary romanticized low-class man that he thinks lived round the corner from in his youth him but he never bothered to shake his hand. Don't get me started on that bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
Ray: Did you see any of the other movies that were discussed during Oscar season?<br/>
<br/>
Ramses: I ain't seen a damn movie since [i]Brokeback Mountain</em> . Ask me that's the movie shoulda won the Oscars. Not that damn  <em>Crash</em> . I'm sick of movies made by foppy-haired white boys who think they know black people. I've cried and cursed while killin black men that was too busy livin lovin and dyin to complain about what the white man did to em. Fuck happened to personal responsibility in this country? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray: Wow Dad I did not know you had such down home politics. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ramses: Ron Paul Oh Twelve. [hangs up][/i]

      I'd like to thank you for indirectly bringing Nannerpuss into my life, bix. One day, I'd never heard of him. The next, his likeness is my desktop and my girlfriend and I now sing the theme where we used to say "Hello, how are you." <br/>

      The only thing that really bothered me about  <em>Million Dollar Baby</em>  was the cheap and horribly contrived way Hillary Swank's character got injured. <br/>

And I agree with Ramses:  <em>Crash</em>  was a movie about racism made for white folk that haven't ever seen a black person.  I can't imagine that anyone who's ever lived in a multi-cultural neighborhood/city wasn't just disgusted by the trite and ham-fisted way the  <strong>RACISM IS BAD</strong>  message was force-fed down the audience's throat.

      The original  <em>Crash</em> , based on the book of the same name was very good and another film where James Spader plays a character involved in psycho-sexual goings on. IIRC this is at least the third such character. Dude knows the right way to get typecast. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I never bothered to see the other piece of shit, but I'm very pissed that they used the name. Seriously, it was taken by a better movie that had a legitimate right to it. Pick another name for your bullshit movie. It's even just a fucking metaphor to begin with, it's not like you couldn't find another one.

Also, I enjoy The Boss's music but I am not a good fan. I have only been into him since  <em>The Rising</em>  and I have not gone into the back catalog yet. Also, I recognize that The Boss's target audience is no longer the working man but the limousine liberals who donated money to Barack Obama's campaign and want populism sold to them in music form.

      You know, Ronald Reagan tried to get "Born in the USA" as his theme song but the Boss wouldn't give it to him.  Even though it was a misguided idea anyhow, since the lyrics probably didn't mean what Ronald Reagan thought they meant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then they asked the boss to play at the superbowl for like 20 years in a row before he finally did it this year.     <br/>

I mean, the dude held out for a pretty long time is all, and what you gonna do, he's still the Boss.

      Ah, I didn't even think someone would use the  <em>Twisted Nerve</em>  theme as a strong association. I guess I could also have called out the bit from  <em>Navajo Joe</em> , but again, I didn't think that would be overly associated. Might make for a decent ringtone though. <br/>

If you must there are basically two great riffs to use for ringtones: The opening riff from  <em>Aqualung</em>  or the main keyboard riff from  <em>The Final Countdown</em>  bringin' it all GOB style.

      Honestly I'm really a fan of harsh minimalism when it comes to interior design. More or less nothing but 90 degree angles, boxy as hell all the way. Just matte black, brushed steel, and glass. <br/>

      I'm actually not a big fan of brutalism. I really want to be, but honestly it usually ends up looking like the cheapest damn way to make incredibly ugly municipal buildings that look dated and trashy. I want to believe that it can be done well because there is promise in it, but so rarely do people ever really do so.

      Definitely no chain-pulling. I'm not the type to jerk off to  <em>Dwell</em>  or anything, but I'm certainly a strong fan of modern design and minimalism. Just not the cutesy stuff or where someone is trying so goddamned hard to make something seem consciously different. But a big rectangle of solid wood stained in a very dark shade? That is an ideal coffee table.

      You forgot a straw so you just drink from the side, but there is too much ice, and it is kind of sticking together.  You can't tilt the glass too much because if you do the ice will avalanche into your face and spill Pepsi all over your shirt and you have English 235 next, and Sarah is in there.  You don't want to spill on yourself, so you only take small sips, and it is the first warm day of spring, so maybe she decided to bust out the spaghetti straps early.  The pizza is good.  The pepperoni is crisp and the Pepsi is so cold. <br/>

      Oddly though I usually prefer Pepsi the cheap place across the street from my dorm* had Coke and they did the syrup just right so it was a bit thicker and sweeter and just worked perfectly. It was the ideal beverage for your pizza regardless of your allegiance. That or one of the also extra-syrupy perfectly sweet Sprites. Man, when people do lemon-lime just a bit too sweet it is the absolute best. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*sigh* I really dislike that so many places around here don't have soda fountains. They all just try to charge you $1.50 for a damn can. No refills, just a huge mark-up on something they bought from the store.   <br/> <br/> <br/> *Where you got ripped-off for delivery, but could always walk-in and get a "special" (so they could claim free delivery) of one pizza (they only made 10" pies) with one topping and a Coke for $5. Plus they're open until 3 AM every night of the week. Hell, nothing around here is open that late and it's a major city. My damn corner store closes at 10!

      Nah, you are getting a small 10" or so. Just a slice or two more than a personal pizza so you have something to go in your mini-fridge. They also had specials where going up to three, IIRC, you could get volume discounts of maybe fifty to seventy-five cents per pizza if you were ordering with friends. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This was just because they knew they could get solid business from the dorms and a few of the campus buildings right across the street, but other people would ludicrously order delivery for like $7-8 for just plain cheese. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was a fairly solid product and while it wasn't great (and friends will occasionally mention how mediocre they were) I still have fond memories of it. I remember exactly how it tasted and while it wasn't fancy it was very solid. Much better than Domino's. Then again, I've seen goats who will not eat Domino's.

      The only reason I dread a Ramses strip is because it means that half of the comments on here are going to be people trying to one-up each other on how badass Ramses is. <br/>

Ramses really is just an oustanding prick in a world where he no longer holds any relevance; ever since the wedding he's just seemed like a confused old codger (hates vegetarians, doesn't want certain types teaching at schools, etc.).  Ramses, like Wild Bill, is gonna get shot in the back by a coward.  That ain't so badass. <br/>

      I thought we all Ctrl F'd our shit.  I certainly do, because I'm an unabashed egotist and get my emotional validation from other people's opinions and attention. <br/>

That having been said, as Spiny Norman puts it below, I haven't felt motivated to contribute that much for a fair while - before The Collapse, even.  I started trolling to engage my interest and for creative exercise, but that's fallen by the wayside for the moment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Given the culling of our numbers, it may result in a Fourth Age of Assetbar, similar to the Second Age.  A time when chubbies actually meant something, and people didn't post all the fucking time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But is that just me being an idealist from a time that long gone, and my pining for it has resulted in the change passing me by?  If I don't admit that the waters around me have grown, better I start swimming lest I sink like a stone?

      I started Ctrl F'in my shit once I realized that it was a lot easier than using the Assetbar INBOX. Unfortunately, I pretty much have to go into the inbox if I want to see more recent replies to things I've said on past strips, but I rarely even care at this point. Sure, maybe once in a while I will try to finish a discussion on an old strip in the wee hours that a new strip has just been posted, but it's pointless. There is no continuity here. I wind up forgetting what's been said on previous strips. My imprint is wiped, like I'm in  <em>Dollhouse</em> . You can't create memories and you can't make friends on the Internet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously though, it'd be nice if Assetbar's INBOX had a collapsible thread system so that you'd only see the most immediate replies to your comments and then a parentheses and number for replies to those replies. And maybe also the ability to see how many chubbies and lames each comment in the SENT page got for easier ego-stroking. And maybe putting new comment replies in bold. The paid Assetbar has that in its Inbox. It's soft and comforting to the touch.

after the barfights <br/> 
we both like the transformers <br/>

was having optimus prime for a dad <br/> 
I wouldn't have laughed <br/> 
so much <br/>

I thought that I heard you crapping <br/> 
your thoughts on a computer screen <br/> 
I think I thought I saw you <br/>

And by occasion, I mean times like now, when I have two long statistics assignments to do and I'm waking up in 9 hours and it'll probably take 4 or 5 to finish the blasted things but spring break is in two days and I can't bring myself to work on anything until the stark necessity of exhaustion rends a sudden devotion to a big final effort to finish it all up but by then I am so exhausted I can't taste victory when I win all I can taste is a whopper this is a run on sentence I am a personified metajoke tonight.

      Ramses needs to go out all Wild Bunch on this.

      I recall reading that it is actually entirely legal for a lady to go topless in New York City due to a legal precedent. It is, of course, one of those things that most of the police are not entirely up on, but it is basically a thing.

I'm also deeply ashamed that it is somehow not also legal in SF. I mean, we have plenty of other events where public nudity and/or exhibitionistic kinky public sex is tolerated, but we're still not OK with nipples? I mean, we only have one nude beach in the city limits and it's always cold and you can't swim.

      Alternatively you could go for outdoor range coolness.  Squint excessively until you have major crows feet, speak in just verbs, and generally move very slowly.  This will require an intimate knowledge of birthing cattle, which may be an insurmountable obstacle.  It may also be the reason that you should only speak in verbs.

      I feel like the comic could have been vastly improved by just cutting it down a bit. Think about it. Take panel seven "It's like finally gettin' to hang out with him" out and instead replace it with the final panel. For the final panel cut everything after "I wish he'd ever come to a parent-teacher conference..." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Instead of a long, ramble from Ramses we have a brief window to him. Ray observes his father and, in the end as much as he wishes he could know someone this bad-ass what he really wants is to have simply known him as a father. Bonus chubs for ending with one last wistful sip. He knows it will never be and could never have been. Nothing needs to be said.

I doubt anyone here knows of Ctrl Alt Del but it is a terrible comic. It is only four panels, and still manages to be entirely too wordy.

      Well, it's not just too wordy (and we've been getting a lot of wordy, cut-and-paste jobs lately), but that the middle adds nothing and kills the momentum and feel of the piece. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Here it is Ray answering, he hears the first bit which tells him it is his father, he listens for a brief moment which sets the scene entirely and shows us his longing to spend time with his absent father, it then ends with him musing about not only how much he looks up to his father (in the guise of a man who is a bad-ass), but more how much he simply wishes he had been a father. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The line about him destroying men also is allowed to take on a double-meaning. Who is the man he has really destroyed: the one on the ground or the one on the phone?

      But you could just do a panel of ray watching Braveheart with a bong in his hand and that is his.  I know these characters, and I want to see what they do, but I want to see them do new things.  Ramses being a badass isn't a new thing, but the way in which he does it is a new thing.  The whole "declaring god dead" thing fleshes out another layer to Ramses character, plus the fact that he got a take-out calzone.  You take those things out and I don't care anymore.  Though I do agree that the "It is like hanging out with him" panel is kind of a matter of telling rather than showing.  There could be a better panel there, but I don't hate it.  But you could go through every comic in the archives and redo it if you wanted to change the pace.

      I think that I disagree with you because I really enjoyed the writing in Ramses's rant. Sometimes when Onstad gets wordy, the idiosyncrasies of his phrasing become a bit top-heavy. But here, he's really grasped the mentality of the character and made a gripping trip into the mind of a borderline fascist.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think fineoakstructure is right in saying that Onstad is both crafting a legendary status for Ramses while also subverting him. There is some amount of criticism that must come from us for someone who is so self assured of his moral absolutes no matter how much we agree with him.

      The last sentence, however, seemed to imply that he is not aware of how he has done that. It seems to me that we are intended to still find Ramses entirely cool and nothing else, not pick up on the borderline fascism that makes him less awesome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It ends up feeling almost like self-parody to me. <br/>

Plus, well, a lot of recent strips have been going longer and longer and I'm not certain it's always the best approach. Hard and lean tends to have worked best in the past and I think it might be a good time to return to that considering the troubles in regular production we've had (that seem, honestly, to largely be over). Plus it'll likely mean fewer cases where the strip is mainly just cut-and-paste.

      While I agree with you about the increasing girth of his comics really not amounting to much, I still think that in this case it works. I'll just agree to disagree on that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
HOWEVER, I do think that you underestimate his writing abilities. Just because Ray is too deluded by his admiration to not notice the negative aspects of his father, doesn't mean Onstad is. I would totally expect Ray to not criticize his father. Only time and more Ramses strips will allow further verification of my hypothesis.

      Here's my two cents on this "character development" we're seeing.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In order for a character to be enjoyable, he does not have to be morally compatible with his viewer or his author. He just has to be a consistent and convincing characterization of a type of person that either we know to exist or that we can imagine to exist. So no, Chris clearly does not have to agree with Ramses' views.  <em>However</em> , if we consider the fact that comedy has positive literary value to society, then any effort to make an otherwise distasteful act into a humorous one already dampens if not all but eliminates its negative qualities. It used to be that parody and satire were interchangeable terms. But what passes as parody nowadays has none of the Swiftian wit and bite that once was the embodiment of satire.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean take a show like Metalocalypse. given the way its characters are portrayed, one might think it's a parody on metal musicians. But I would argue that if it is a parody at all, it is at the same time, and to a greater degree, a  <em>homage</em>  to the very thing it purports to parody. It's an  <em>idealization</em>  of that thing, exaggerating all the humorous aspects, be they good or bad, and eliminating all the bad-by-itself, thereby tricking us into believing that those bad traits are not so bad after all.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The point being that the motive to humorize something in such a way comes from an admiration of it, or at least certain aspects of it, which become the focus of the humorization. That's pretty much what Chris is doing with Ramses here, and what he's been doing with Ray all along. I'm pretty sure Ray's relationship with his dad simply provided a template within which Chris could unload his dialogue of badassery that he daydreams about uttering in real life just all the time. Ramses had to make a reappearance after Chris realized that a talking stomach just couldn't kick ass such as a grown man does. Grown men do not pick on depressed cats named Roast Beef. That is  <em>low</em> .

      He was all the names in history? <br/> 
Sorry for being cryptic, it's  <em>them</em>  rubbing off. Nietzsche's anti-Socratic thing is based in part on the original V. copy deal that's a big thing for Plato. In the later Nietzsche, before even the eternal return episode, there's mentions of parody galore, seen as "life" and the "laughter of the gods." To "post-modernists" of the "French thought" cabal of the 60's and 70's, it only makes sense that all facts being ultimately interpretations, all representations are actually a parody, a repetition/rehearsal, or a simulacrum - depending if you ask Lyotard, Deleuze, Klossowski or Derrida. As representations, eulogies and homages necessarily deride identity and the seriousness of reverence. In turn, this derision made in a world of illusions and copies only is the most sincere form of reverence.  <br/> 
That, or I just wanted to sound like I'm really smart.

      it's in the zeitgeist man, it's a natural extension of living in a media saturated environment. just think of how video and audio recording completely change the nature of how we "remember" as a culture: in days of yore, you had to depend on the (much less reliable) recollection of your elders to know what had happened in days past. now it's all on youtube. i feel like i should make an ironic reference now, but will abstain.

      My feeling is that people have been relying on books for a time, and that it's less the zeitgeist now than good old coming of drinking age. I mean, people have been talking about media saturation and post-modernity since the at least the beginning of the 20th century and the whole concept was mainstream enough to hit costumed comics in the mid eighties.  <br/> 
If anything, in this age when we are able to know a lot about it, we assume more of the past than we actually know. Somewhere below, someone references  <em>Everything is everything </em> as lyrics from a song. Everyone likes to think their generation invented irony and parody, but things like  <em>we're all holograms</em>  have popped up before (all idealisms and immaterialisms), and may again.

      As tripleg said, people used to have only what human hands, minds and mouths could re-create to envision the past. Now we live with the collective memory of the human race at our fingertips. How can we help but be post-modern when past and present, sacred and profane constantly exist all around us in a visible way? It was bad enough when you had to just imagine that time was just a function of a dumb monkey brain, but when you can almost see it?

What's really postmodern is that you may well be quoting word for grunt the guy whose second cousin did the first wall paintings in a cave of Western Europe.

      yes totally, because all cave people all around the world had nigh-instantaneous access to those paintings and then photoshopped them into oblivion, reposting them on cave walls using neanderthal lolspeak. yes.

      "Back in my day if we wanted to know something we either heard it from our parents or the village elder, but now we've got these damn bards traveling around all over the place. I swear almost any night I can go down to the pub and hear an epic recounting of days of yore, not just the vague recollection that one time Odysseus passed through town and he was like, y'know, kind of a big deal and did some cool stuff. Now I can't help but be bombarded with all of Herakles labors in perfect order (not to mention rhythm and meter) like they just happened yesterday. It really changes your perceptions." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I agree with you guys, but, this is basically always the nature of things. Every generation keeps thinking these same exact thoughts. You want to think that this wasn't the same deal after the widespread development of movable type? Radio? C'mon... it's nothing new and it never will be.

      I wasn't making a value judgment on our increasing access to information. I was just making an observation. It's probably a good thing. I just think that that contributes to this sense of postmodernism that pervades a lot of our culture, the pastiche, the bringing together of past and present, sacred and profane. Even my clothes are postmodern. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I say that despite the fact that this is the nature of things, I am lumping together all mass media when I say we have instant access to so much stuff. But in particular, the internet has really changed the damn game. There is a huge difference between the move from movable type to radio in terms of spreading ideas, and the move from radio/tv to internet. If I had a dispute about a certain fact with a friend and I wanted to verify who is right, a bard, or TV was not instantly at my beck and call to give me the answer. It meant a trip to the library or my home encyclopedia to give the answer. Now, information to verify this (good or bad) is right under my nose at all times. My fucking cell phone holds more information than an entire library just a couple decades ago.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't want to turn this into a debate about whether this is a good or bad thing. It's probably good. I just want to make a distinction between our times, and other times in which we've experienced increasing availability of information.

      Ah, sorry, I thought you meant post-modern.  <br/> 
'Cause there ought to be a word to describe how things have changed (and I'd say there are new things around en masse), even though it's obvious we don't really have nigh-instantaneous access to anything that matters. Sadly, that word is not spamming the internet yet, so we have to either wait or go to a lecture.  <br/>

Honestly Assetbar, have you ever gotten a bomb phone call that was just totally "Unknown"?  Either debt-collectors, sexual predators, the cops, or an accidental dial.  If it is anything important, they'll leave a message; hopefully with a real phone number attached to it.

      I would, but it's been done.  I didn't even invent that idea.  I was only moderately creepy until loneal claimed I had kidnapped her.  Worst I did back then was watch women sleep without them knowing.  I've been meaning to do something with the persona sometime, but creepin ain't easy

      I can't do that. I wake up in the night or such and look at my girlfriend asleep and it just makes me think that she looks dead. That is how she would look if she was dead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The whole thing about someone dead looking like they're just sleeping has whipped back on me and it now makes me think asleep people look dead. I do not want this to be the way. Then again sleep always reminds me of death. I really don't like this. I don't like sleeping at all.

      I wish I was just playing a part. Thankfully most of my problems don't interfere with my daily life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I did, however, get so freaked out by rain while I was trying to sleep the other night that I had to get up, get some water, and make a serious effort to calm down. It was just... it's so astoundingly weird, but we just take it for granted because we're used to it. That doesn't make it any less weird. If anything contemplating the universe and reality just makes things even more weird and far worse. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sometimes I worry that my grasp of reality is shaky and I might be losing it, but really that's not the problem. It's more that I acknowledge reality, but can't accept it.  The terror of existing vs. the horror of non-being. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As I said, though, this rarely impacts my daily life much except late at night when I'm left alone with my thoughts.

      Man, after reading this strip I have got to share some anecdotal evidence of how completely  <em>badass</em>  this fictional cat is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ramses has read the Bible enough to have sections of it memorized, I bet. He is behavior is not necessarily exemplary of a God-fearing man but he is old school. He's not just an angry dude, he is filled with Righteous Indignation and he will beat your ass. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The dude has got RESPECT. Maybe this idea doesn't sit too well with you internet atheists but what I'm trying to say is that Ramses Luther Smuckles knows when words have power, and he doesn't dismiss them just because he disagrees.

      And to the people who inevitably lame me because I went off on this drooling tangent or they have a bone to pick, I just want to say that I really like Achewood. The dialogue is worth reading every time, it's not just a punchline, and yeah Ramses L. Smuckles is a violent crotchety old man with strong outdated opinions but it would really make me sad if Achewood stopped having characters that I could really believe in. <br/> <br/> <br/> Even if they are talking cats.

      I dislike Ramses not because his opinions are outdated, but because he is basically a walking incarnation of the Chuck Norris joke, the man so badass that he can never be defeated by anyone and his army did not rebel after he denied them dinner. The Invincible Man is the most boring character type in all of fiction, and it is shockingly out of place in Achewood.

      Righteous indignation is the most useless and destructive emotion in the human canon.  Everyone feels jealousy, or rage, or fear, but it is only when we become righteously indignant about it that people do horrible things to other people.  Rameses is a fictional character.  No real person could be so immaculate.  People like Rameses in real life were assholes like John Wayne.

      I have to say it somewhere somehow so I'll say it here - please tgh read no criticism of how you could make something good out of seeing the movie. That movie was bad, like a disgrace and a poor interpretation, like a failed cover of a beautiful song and a hell of a way to turn a  <em>good</em>  story into a weak ass scenario made into a lame sequence of frames you can't relate to, but mostly bad like a bad movie. I'm ashamed I have eyes now. There are worst ways to lose two and half hours, but most of them include being in a coffin with maggots reaching to your nostrils and you can't quite grab and answer the phone that some Kanye West fan dropped by your knee.

      Did they really drop THAT much story though... I suppose it depends on how long you are committed to sitting in a theatre to have all of the plot covered. They definitely have to cut it down for budgetary purposes and mainstream consumption. In summary, I thought it was great.

      Screw the mainstream consumption bullshit. It's kinda crap when they announce before a film releases that there will be even more footage added back in for the DVD release. I mean, yeah, it's good that it'll be there, but what about just releasing the damn thing properly the first time. <br/>

I've never complained about a film being long. You want to make it four hours? Five? I'm totally game if it's good and necessary. Better value for my money.

      Screw that. I'm game for four or five hours if it is worth it, but more of the same from that movie would not have been. If they cut about half the scenes by half their length, they probably would have ended up with the same amount of story, then they could have added more in. Instead he had to go all kitsch art-director and make the scenes way too long out of some sense of misplaced homage. <br/>

I actually thought the movie was pretty entertaining, but that was a major gripe for me.

      Okay, I was just getting out of seeing it. Maybe I overreacted, and maybe I was just expecting to find a bit of what I experienced when reading the comic.  <br/> 
Basically, I guess I'm saying it sucks because  <em> there's no vision here!</em>   <br/> 
I think it's a shame to shoot it frame for frame and yet miss the tone. If it's Snyder's interpretation of the book, it's like he never really read it but rather was told the story by someone who was pointing some panels to him. There's idiosyncrasy, rhythm and ambivalence aplenty that was lost or turned into Badang Kappow fight scenes. It's bland where it was rich. A shame.  <br/> 
Also, the production turned the implied score into a parody, the acting is sub-par, it's shot and edited like an expensive tv show, costume folks become superpowered killing machines, and the cool monster of dread disappeared.  <br/> 
It's really not what they dropped in terms of scenes that bothers me, it's how they're pretending that making a smart movie from a smart book is impossible and we should accept it. Apparently, Snyder has no problem accepting it as a given, but hell if I'm gonna be contemporary to the trend he's reveling in without posting my outrage on assetbar.

      I really don't see how you could call the movie a poor interpretation considering their slavish devotion to preserving as many frames of the comic as they could.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think Snyder did this to a fault, and that the movie is fatally flawed in some important ways, but it did evoke the story very powerfully and allowed me to re-experience it with some fresh wonder.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
A story is just a story, and Snyder wasn't out to exploit Watchmen to make a buck, he had genuine reverence for the material.  If the movie had to be made in the first place, at least there wasn't a talking Bubastis and a happy ending.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, seriously, the fact that a serious adaptation of Watchmen exists and that society en masse is discussing the original work stands as a victory, I think.

      I geniunely feel like Snyder doesn't have an exploiting bone in his body. I'm not apologizing for him, I hated what he did with DotD and haven't seen nor really plan on seeing 300, but I get the feeling he has an appreciation for medium that some action directors just do not have. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the changes that were made enabled it to be marketable, and I didn't feel like any fights scenes were added on, just magnified (the prison fighting was barely shown in the book, for example yet was the key setpiece in the movie. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I actually hadn't read the book for a while so my girlfriend, who just finished reading it because I gave her the book for Valentine's Day, caught a lot more of the shot-for-shot stuff than I did. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that this is probably the most faithful adaptation we will probably ever get, moreso than if Gilliam or Aranofsky or any other director who was at one point in a position to do the film, and while I don't think it absolutely NEEDED to be adapted I'd rather have one that was as close to the book as humanly possible while still missing the point than a 9/11-sploitation film or a film where Dr. Manhattan goes back in time and stops Ozymandias and everyone lives (two films that almost happened). <br/> 
 <br/> 
My only true beef with the movie was the fucking guy who played Ozy. Holy shit did he suck and miss the point of the character.

      Yeah, I thought they did pretty well casting for the most part, but Ozymandias was bad. <br/>

I did think it was neat how even though they dropped the newsman subplot entirely, they still showed the destruction of New York almost frame for frame, including all the characters who were present, even though they hadn't actually showed up before.

      That scene was more heartwrenching for me having read the book than a normal viewer. In the book the squid basically just teleports in and they all pretty much die, it is fast and not as telegraphed (I may be remembering this wrong) but in the movie it lingers and lingers and I was just thinking about all those characters lives and started bawling. It hit me the same as the book but was just visually more impacting than the squid ending. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also I cried at the (SPOILER)Rorschach death scene. So well acted. <br/>

      Even in the end Ozy is super toned. Bulky = Muscle bound. The guy kicks everyone's ass except for Dr. Manhattan. I would suggest that PSH would have to do some serious preperation for the role (i.e. a year or so).

      Well considering there had been talks about this specific incarnation of the movie for a while now, he would have had time. <br/>

      I have to agree. PSH would absolutely nail Ozy.  All soft voiced and believable, "Hey, what a nice, funny guy.  Definitely a good guy."  Then, "Oh shit, he is scary, how did I fall for that."  Cept for the chunky middle-agedness, he would have been perfect.

      I'm definitely going to have to re-read it but I always thought that Ozy was the second oldest, after The Comedian. Nite Owl and Rorschach are the closest in age and Laurie is the youngest (although not by much. I'd put Dr. Manhattan in there but age is relative for him. He seems younger than his old form anyway). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the thing where Snyder failed was that it didn't have to be image for image the same as the book. If they had let it slide a bit they could have gotten better actors, although I feel the only one who needed to be replaced was Ozy.

      Fully agreed.  For all the bitching about Malin Ackerman's performance, I never thought that Laurie was all that well fleshed out anyway.  She's a superhero because her mom was?  So?  Moore, if I remember right, never really goes there.  She's just "the girl", and Ackerman is "a girl".  Ozy was the weak sauce.  A bad villain would normally kill a movie, but the real villain in Watchmen is Mankind Itself, so a bad Ozy doesn't hurt it that much, just weakens a core support beam.

      After some thought, I realized... they took out smokes (and other drugs) indiscriminately regardless of whether they were a plot point <br/> 
- Rorschach never stubs out a cigarette in a kid's eye <br/>

      A little of both. Hollywood has for some time been moving towards "only bad people smoke", and one of the producers of  <em>Watchmen</em>  hates smoking and absolutely would not allow anyone who wasn't a bad guy (the Comedian) to smoke. So yeah, instead of Laurie accidentally setting the basement on fire due to an honest mistake, she pushes the flamethrower button like a curious three-year-old.

      I don't have real figures for all of them, but... <br/> 
The Comedian - b. 1919 or so. <br/> 
Silver Spectre - conceived 1945?  Unclear whether this is when the attempted rape or actual fatherhood occured <br/> 
Ozymandias - became hero 1958 <br/> 
Manhattan - "accident" 1960 <br/>

      I kind of wish there was an actual limit on the number of 5's that can be given out per user.  I may be wrong, but i seem to remember that when we could see the ratings almost every last strip other than the cumbrella one and a few others had an average above 4.  Even so, I'm not quite as frugal as you with my 5's.  I figure if no more than 5% of the 1500  strips (about 75 at the moment) get your top rating you are using it responsibly.

      I sometimes wish that instead of or in addition to having the user select some integer between 1 and 5 inclusive for each strip, assetbar would select (by some process) maybe 4 or 5 strips at a time and have the user order them from best to worst (and then deduce rankings from that).

      What if the last 5 strips sucked ass?... <br/> 
No, my opinion is that the rating should be based on a larger scale. From 1 to 10 or even 20 for instance. <br/>

Anyway the rating feature's kind of useless now the average isn't displayed... <br/>

      I was thinking that assetbar's selection process would be somewhat random, but also biased in a way that depended on the given strip's ranking history (presumably in a way somewhat similar to e.g. kittenwar). Strips which tended to win ranking competitions frequently would be pitted against other strips which did the same. New strips would initally be compared to representatives from fixed regions of the ranking spectrum etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The thing I dislike about scale-based rating systems is that I often can't remember exactly how I feel about the given item in comparison to items which received the same scale score from me - and even when I can, it's hard to quantify the difference.

      Strips quality/appreciation may vary from a week to another; in which case basing the final rating on previous strips' ranking history would make it unfaithful in my opinion. I'd rather let my subjectivity inaccurately rate a few strips than let others affect my own assessment. <br/>

      Not really.  You think that only .66% of the strips are worthy of a top ranking?  It's all about personal preference, of course, and I'll agree that ranking too many strips as 5 makes it meaningless, but, on the flip side, only picking about 10 strips out of 1522 is ridiculously narrow.  This guy has written a lot of fucking funny strips.   <br/>

My own personal percentage of 5's is probably hovers slightly above 10%.

"You did what?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Daniel cringed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I...I cloned you." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"You...cloned me." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Listen, Panda Bear--" Daniel began. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Don't like it when you call me that. Having black and white mask does not make me panda bear." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Okay, fine, Rorschach...just here me out on this one. I know that fighting evil or whatever is your life's grand work, but...sometimes I feel like you're too busy for me. And, y'know..." Daniel shifted uncomfortably and gazed down at his feet. "Sometimes, I have...urges. And when you're not around--" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rorschach leapt up, hands over his ears. "YOU PROMISED WE WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT THAT. NEVER HAPPENED." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Okay, okay! Sorry, Pan--Rorschach. So, the logical next step was to make another you." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"How is that a logical next step?" he sputtered, but Daniel wasn't listening. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"But..well, obviously, I did it wrong, because I meant to make an adult you. But instead, I made this tiny you." <br/> 
 <br/> 
He gestured to the child in question, a short, skinny boy with adorable red hair and freckles who was currently snoring gently on the couch. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"So, yeah...now we have this mini-Rorschach. But he's so cute! He looks like you, and he likes me to read him The New Frontiersmen before he goes to sleep at night, and---" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Daniel, do you have any idea what I was like as a child? Burned boy's eye out with cigarette when TEN YEARS OLD. Was completely disturbed and fucked up." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"But this Rorschach won't be, because he'll have two daddies who love him very much! We'll make him cupcakes and sing to him and play pirates!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rorschach put his face in his hands, exasperated. "Not raising clone of myself. Not happening. Going now." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"But Panda Bear!" Daniel called out to him as he walked away. "How can you abandon him? Do you want him to have major daddy issues like you?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
That stopped Rorschach dead in his tracks. If Daniel really was hell-bent on raising this little clone (and it sounded like he was), he didn't want the kid to be all weird and miserable like he had been. There might be room for another Walter Kovacs in the world, but there sure as hell wasn't room for another Rorschach. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He turned around, looking at the little boy on the couch. He was wrapped up snugly in a fuzzy green blanket, and he looked very warm and cozy. He looked...happy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rorschach sighed. He really, really didn't want to create another fucked-up child. There were enough of those. And damnit, the kid looked just like him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, no, not just like him. He looked how Rorschach might have looked if he never had become Rorschach, if he had been happy and safe and loved. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Damnit. Fine. Will help you. But you owe me." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Daniel wiggled his eyebrows saucily. "Oh, don't worry...I'll pay you back. You won't regret this."

      This is very true. Also most of the other films mentioned are definitely not classics and not necessarily worth watching. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It basically took a great novel that was about mysticism and the transition between the 19th and the 20th century and turned it into a fairly generic Jack the Ripper story. In the book the identity is never even remotely secret. You see him from before the murders even start and you see him committing all of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not bad it's just not particularly accurate to the book in theme or nature. Seriously though, read the comic, it's great.

      It was OK, but I think I preferred the novella. It didn't really add much being filmed. I still wouldn't call it a classic and I preferred  <em>Misery</em>  if you forced me to choose. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not big on uplifting stories that celebrate the human spirit. I'm more into, say,  <em>Requiem for a Dream</em>  where everyone gets fucked in the end. But I'm a pessimist.

      Yes, but it should be noted that the film and the novella are identical. That's impressive no matter what, but for a King adaptation to be so well handled is really without precedent. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not to mention that it's just a damn good story. It's not mind-blowing or anything. It didn't change literature or Hollywood. It was just a good story. That's all I ask for.

      Very true. It was a pretty damn solid adaptation. Likely because it was precisely the right length to be adapted and it was a basic sort of story. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For me it's the sort of movie that I might watch on cable if absolutely nothing else is on. This has not been an issue for many, many years now what with Tivo, DVDs, and such. Maybe if I'm away from home or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not worth intentionally watching. I put it in the same category that I also place Major League 2, Stay Tuned, Mom and Dad Save the World, and a host of other movies I saw maybe a half-dozen or more times simply because I grew up with HBO and Cinemax and would often be absorbed in something else or otherwise not change the channel between movies.

      Actually, and I think that I've commented on this before, but as he gets older his work is becoming more and more pornographic in nature. For shit's sake, he had a  <em>1984</em>  inspired Tijuana Bible in  <em>Black Dossier</em> !  <br/>

Not that I'm complaining as he is still a really good writer, it's just funny. You could hardly call  <em>V for Vendetta</em>  sexual (at least I wouldn't).

      Except that the Tijuana Bible was really well-done and a spot-on parody of the book. It was really more or less ideal. I'd think that that many other instances of sex and culture would be targeted. Of course, this goes back to the first series which also paid appropriate attention to sexual literature of the era as it was a relevant consideration. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dude just isn't afraid to discuss the sexual underpinnings of our society. I've got no problem with that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Lost Girls</em>  worked well as both classy porn and interesting commentary. Not my favorite Moore work by any stretch, but it was done well. It's biggest fault was only coming out in the super-expensive classy multi-volume slipcased hardcover.

      I didn't say he was doing a bad job of drawing porno, just that most of his recent work is saturated in sex. I'm fine with reading that but I like to read comic books wherever I go, so unfortunately  <em>The League</em>  has been relegated to bedtime reading when everyone else in the house is asleep.

      Well, it's more saturated with sex compared to the first  <em>League</em>  book and other stuff, I guess. I don't really care, I'm fairly healthy sexually and watched enough porn in my past to not care anymore about sexual images.

      Yet that is exactly what I see you doing here. You care about people seeing you viewing sexual images in what I assume is a non-erotic manner. Specifically the Tijuana Bible in  <em>Black Dossier</em>  was a wonderful skewering of  <em>1984</em>  which really did try to push the idea that sex - not necessarily just love, but out-and-out and then probably in again sex - conquered all and was an expression of the indominability of the human spirit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Going off onto a tangent I also recommend  <em>Down and Out in Paris and London</em> . Not for some socialist reason, but simply because it is an interesting and enjoyable read. The idea that Britain required tramps to literally tramp around the country staying at different shelters each night just seems so very odd to me. It also caused me to hate the Salvation Army just a little bit more (and I do hate them quite a lot). If you ever see one of them soliciting donations and smoking be sure to call them on it as they are most explicitly not allowed to do that by the tenants of their weirdly militaristic religion.

      In all fairness I think I have spent maybe 15 minutes in San Jose itself. It's just the sort of thing where you never really see any need or reason to go there. It feels like the center of suburbs that exists solely so they have something a bit closer to be suburban to. <br/>

      I didn't realize they had sharks. I mean, aren't they more or less inland or do they have a tiny bit of the bay? I'd think there would be plenty of better places to go for sharks though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The closest I would normally go is Great America (the one in Chicago looks better, but what would I know, I'm still basically afraid of roller coasters even after finally going on one a few years ago) and that's over in Santa Clara. It's weird though since going in it feels like it's just behind some office park. Not a typical place for an amusement park in my experience.

      It's monday <br/> 
 <br/> 
5 am <br/> 
 <br/> 
I chowed down on <br/> 
 chocolate & almond candy, then tried to go to sleep. <br/> 
didn't work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I sort of dozed a little I guess. <br/> 
 <br/> 
so <br/> 
 <br/> 
here I am <br/> 
 <br/> 
contemplating fairly universal concepts, in the context of my own fairly <br/> 
proprietary self and situation and station <br/> 
 <br/> 
resisting the temptation to and the habit of thinking on a low level...  AP <br/> 
articles in a newspaper... fragments of a greater world...  all my thoughts... <br/> 
fragments of.... myself?  No... not really.  false in both instances.  The whole <br/> 
is greater than the fragments...  if I am only fragments, then ... am I?  <br/> 
Answer:  No. But there is still a me, so far anyway, a me somewhere in the <br/> 
center of it all... quite a mystery how I happened and what I happen to be, but <br/> 
I guess I did and I am.  A fundamental sort of me.  And then <br/> 
 <br/> 
 there <br/> 
 is <br/> 
 the ... <br/> 
you know... the peripheral me...  While I can't speculate on the fundamental <br/> 
me, (all I know is I have a sort of impression <br/> 
 that I'm there, and constant <br/> 
and sentient and apparently oddly enough well rounded... well...) I can say that <br/> 
the peripheral me, all fragmented and such, is, well, not too impressive, and <br/> 
well on it's way to becoming a small and ignorant person.  And then... <br/> 
foomp... it happens...  the peripheral you takes over for the internal you, and <br/> 
then, you are, for all intents and purposes, a waste of carbon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
that's it then.  I'm not sure what it will be like, and how completely <br/> 
I will realize it, or even how much fun it will be (fun... funny how I throw <br/> 
that out there... a sort of universal reference point of a unilateral base need <br/> 
and desire... a metric by which all meaning is quantified... a bottomless pit in <br/> 
the shallow superficie of the soul...)  but I am sure...  <br/> 
 sure <br/> 
 that it <br/> 
 is what <br/> 
 I <br/> 
must do, even if I'm not sure that I can...  So yes, no more endless <br/> 
contemplation of the infinite, no more losing myself in the <br/> 
 infinite maze of <br/> 
chaos of low-level complexity...  entropy beckons, calls out my name from all <br/> 
directions, and I must find the opposite direction, I must double back. <br/> 
 <br/> 
hmmm <br/> 
 <br/> 
okay then.  in other words, embracing high level concepts...  is what I shall <br/> 
do...  am already starting to... and it's neat, man...  It is changing my <br/> 
dreams...  I have like, normal dreams again... and when I close my eyes, I can <br/> 
visualize things I couldn't before... because I am seeing things that I <br/> 
didn't before... literally....  when I look at a photo, or a person's <br/> 
face...   and I can't draw... but maybe that will change too... <br/> 
 <br/> 
so I had some chocolate milk.  maybe that'll make me sleep. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm hoping the caulk in the shower dries in time for me to take a <br/> 
 <br/> 
 shower <br/> 
tomorrow... at this <br/> 
 rate it <br/> 
 won't... <br/> 
 <br/> 
we got another squirrel today in the trap in the attic... squirrel # 2...  I <br/> 
wired a sensor to the trap so I can tell from the <br/> 
 basement when it has closed.  <br/> 
We released the squirrel somewhere far enough away he won't find his way <br/> 
back hopefully. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I installed a new door knob in their bathroom door...  the old one broke... they had this old-style <br/> 
cartridge lock ... you've seen them...  so I removed the door knobs and the <br/> 
cartridge, left the metal face plates on either side, filled it with foam, and <br/> 
put the new door knob above it. drilled out a hole and all for it.  fun stuff. <br/> 
working with wood is always nice.

      yeah... don't ask me about the line feeds... this text is from a replied-to copy of an e-mail I wrote exactly one week previously.  The e-mail programs involved somehow added in those line feeds, using what logic I do not know, which in any case adds nicely to the non sequitur character of the prose. <br/> 
 <br/> 
...And I am guessing from the response that non-sequitur babble is not everyone's cup of tea here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This passage is actually expressive of genuine and coherent introspection, although, as far as this expression it's self is concerned, it is obviously pedantic, idiosyncratic, and atypical in it's use of whatever the written-language equivalent of or analog to prosody would be called. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for speculation that I'm ManFlesh, AIU Snick Stereo, GuitarHero, etc.  I am none of them.  I'm just myself.  so hello everyone.  Sorry for the megalomaniac user name.  it's not really intended like that.  It's just a word I have liked since I heard it in a Lauryn Hill song... 'everything is everything...'  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I found this strip to be sad.  It seems to portray this sense that there is so much time in our lives that we spend alone, disconnected from others, immersed in our struggle with the world, time ticking forward, an accidentally overheard phone call providing more human connection with someone than anything we deliberately do all day, week, or possibly even all year.  These are the moments we are supposed to experience when we discover after someone is now decades older or has passed, some long-forgotten tape recording of that person.. and yet, more and more often we are experiencing these moments in the here and now... that awkward accidentally mis-dialed call from the now ex-girl friend, that distance and melancholy that envelopes you as you browse your ex's myspace page.. you're not talking anymore... your lives have gone different directions, and yet, here is this photo album of this life the two of you never quite experienced together, yet in a one-sided sort of way, sort of are... like some kind of quantum phenomenon, observing it, knowing that to actually reach out and contact him or her would change the experience.  This is the strange reality we are creating for ourselves, a sort of interweaving of parallel universes that never could have nor would have existed without this ubiquitous cybernetic infusion of media, this searing integration of this media into the flesh of our psyches...  I'm not sure which it is, maybe it's both...  either life is imitating art "look at me, I'm in the surreal realm of Achewood USA" or art is, in this particular strip anyway, succumbing to life...  'look at Ray... he's Human...' <br/> <br/> <br/>

      It's somehow comforting to see that someone can create an assetbar account just so that this can be posted. That sort of incongruous effort would make the broken prose and impossible conceit worthwhile if it wasn't for the fact that someone came up with the whole "troll" thing before.

      Theguitarhero closes his laptop with a final click.  Dust motes tumble across the one beam of daylight that peeks through the his room's thick black curtains.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The beam illuminates a poster on the wall of President Laura Roslin, photoshopped into entertaining a non-standard number of sexual partners.  He did the photoshop himself, and had Kinko's blow it up shortly after the episode where Roslin and Adama smoked pot on the grass of New Caprica together.  There was something alluring about the idea of sharing a little home with the president of the remainder of humanity, in space.  There was something alluring about imagining her having sex with a bunch of dudes, too.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
While masturbating himself to sleep after bringing the poster home, TGH had made a silent promise to the Gods: he would never miss an episode from that moment on, and in return they would grant him his dream of a little house with the President, in space. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fermatprime's comment had pierced his heart like so much frakking shrapnel.  He had failed.  He would never be with his beloved Laura.  He would never get to stroke her bald but now recovering chemotherapy head in space, in their little house. <br/> 
 <br/> 
No time.  No time to verify.  Only one way to prove his devotion.  Surely the Gods would understand his mistake and accept his penance.  Surely they would grant him mercy and TGH would wake up aboard a resurrection strip, gasping for air in the fetal goo a new life, a life finally filled with people who understood him.  And robots. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As he reached for the gun he kept beneath his full-sized Centurion head, complete with LCD eyes and everything, his hand bumped his desk brining his desktop pc to life.  It opened to the Sci-Fi channel homepage, as always. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Oh thank gods," he said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The home page had a list of all the recent episodes, and he had missed none of them.  Theguitarhero reopened his laptop and masturbated himself to sleep.

      Roslin is just space Palin. I have no time for her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still think Baltar is unfairly persecuted. The whole deal with New Caprica was totally not his fault. He was no longer in control when things went to shit and everyone just blames him regardless. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Both Adama and Roslin are frequently scary conservative pricks and sometimes I can't tell whether the show is endorsing a sort of pro-Bush agenda or whether it's trying to comment on it negatively. It straddles the line a bit too often.

I'm supporting Baltar. Hippie sex cult with attractive ladies or being a dick to people all the damn time and trying to push people out of airlocks and keep them imprisoned for what are often political reasons? Not much of a choice really.

      While I agree that most of the Humans in BSG are seemingly overly conservative, think of what they've been through.  <em>They've watched their entire race be decimated by robot slaves.</em>  They've  <em>all</em>  resorted to doing bad things on New Caprica, and I think a lot of Baltar's guilt for his actions died with Gaeta.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Frankly, Adama and Roslin have every right to be conservative but they aren't AS conservative as some of the people on the Battlestar. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roslin definitely is not Palin though. She is way smarter and a better rounded character.

      You don't have every right to start rigging elections and throwing people out of airlocks. Nor do you get to throw people in prison and torture them as often as they both seem to want to do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll agree that Roslin is both smarter and better rounded (though you could say the same thing about a cinder block), but she's still a minor government official that suddenly was thrust into a position of prominence that she is entirely unprepared for and responds with surprisingly conservative tactics that I think Palin would heartily endorse. It's not a perfect comparison, but it works for me as well as Adama '08. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My issue with Baltar wasn't about guilt, but that bullshit trial and such. He did nothing wrong on New Caprica and they're just looking for a scapegoat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roslin was pretty good in  <em>Sneakers</em>  though, let's talk about that.

      The VP wanted to overthrow the entire government, killed the entire Quorum in cold blood and almost got Galactica blown up, all because Adama wanted to fix the Battlestar. Roslin is way less conservative than him.

      I still like the Doors in an entirely unironic manner. Screw you losers. It's like you don't enjoy organ solos...  <em>and we all know that TGH likes nothing better</em> . <br/>

And on that note  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100408120835/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeQsZOQqO6I">this</a>  has Carl Palmer playing a drum solo that is masturbatory even by 1970's prog rock standards.

Daltrey - Surprisingly, no. Well, not that surprising, I guess. The Who are great enough for it not to matter. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plant - If I were a time-traveling super sniper (sadly, I am not) and I had a clear shot at Plant and Hitler (and you fuckin'  <em>know</em>  they were tight)....well, that'd be no choice at all. One squeeze of the trigger to save the world from  <em>Physical Graffiti?</em>  I'd do my part.

      This tells me you are not even within the same solar system of "getting" Jim Morrison. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong><em>let me tell you about Jim Morrison and the Big Beat-<br/>
Soft, low, thoughtful, turning into a raging screaming beast <br/>
of undeniable feeling.<br/>
He HEARD the BEAT,<br/>
 he lived it, <br/>
he swam away in its tide, <br/>
and drowned like a baby in his tub.<br/>
<br/>
He was a poet of our generation, <br/>
but not like that  fucking brilliant neurotic Ginsberg, <br/>
not like that other gifted nutcase Brautigan- <br/>
and nothing at all like the 99.9% who have come after<br/>
with their derivative, dull, pretentious crap,crap,carrrrap.<br/>
<br/>
He was a Byronic flame, seeking, creeping, engulfing..<br/>
cosmic in his humanity, frail in his romantic ignorance-<br/>
a volcano of excess and passion<br/>
that probably would have blown his head off anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Jim was a poet. He was a meteor that flew back<br/>
off the face of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
The other 3 Doors were and would have remained<br/>
obscure and unknown, but for him.<br/>
<br/>
It is fitting and fine that they live on<br/>
like Kings on their royalties.<br/>
It is fitting also that Jim lived like an asshole,<br/>
With no regard for anything.<br/>
yet he played with words that will not be forgotten.<br/>
So he will be remembered</em></strong> <br/> <br/> <br/> and for the record- <br/> 
I'm still pissed at Mikey. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It'll be 40 years this summer, <br/> 
that he whined he had  <br/> 
to take his mom's car back <br/> 
after Day 2 of Lewisville Pop-  <br/> 
Which we voted for instead- <br/> 
instead of Woodstock. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The lesser, yet nearer <br/> 
Lewisville, Texas Speedway. <br/> <br/> <br/> And the rest of us were too scared to  <br/> 
hang out in the 100-plus degree heat, <br/> 
For the best, last day, <br/> 
and hitch 90 miles home. <br/> 
We'd never done such a thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We'd seen Janis and Canned Heat, <br/> 
Led Zep(pfft) Santana, Chicago, <br/> 
B.B. King and Freddie King, <br/> 
Buddy Guy,  Incredible String Band. <br/> 
(and the Dead played at the campground) <br/> 
 <br/> 
But we missed Day 3, <br/> 
so we missed The Doors.

      I can't find any references that the Doors actually played there and they certainly weren't listed on the poster. Frankly, from what I can find, Day 3 seemed good, but like the least essential day.

      You may be right. They were not listed originally, but I was told they were a last-minute addition. <br/> 
 But it is also entirely possible someone was yanking my chain with that story, although the guy I recall telling me that was not typically an embellisher. <br/> 
 In fact, (sideline story), this guy I did not know at the time, a paraplegic, wheelchair-bound longhair, was our landmark amidst the several-hundred thousand strong crowd. Whenever you had to leave to get sustenance or a porta-potty break, it was hella difficult to find your party on the return. <br/> 
 Coincidentally, he was in my freshman dorm a few months later, and at some point the subject of that Festival came up, and then the memory that it was the same guy. Same stetson hat, etc. <br/> 
 He became one of my best friends, he was just an amazing human being. He died 6-7 years ago. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 However, the 3rd day included Ten Years After and Spirit, both of whom were at their peak then. I later saw Sly & The Family Stone- they put on a great show. Alot of the bands that played free like Grand Funk, Grateful Dead- they weren't listed. <br/> 
 The 12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus is one of the very few albums from then I can still listen to occasionally today.

      Amazing. The only band Stereo has a care about? I really liked them back then.  <br/> 
 I guess Alvin Lee may have the original shredder, but we thought he still hit tasteful licks, unlike Mark Farner. <br/> 
 He was a total speedfreak, or did a believable rendition of one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 I doubt I could bear to listen to them today, but that would be like Cornelius Bear trying to rock out to those groups. <br/> 
 The flame dies down eventually, and thank God for that.

      Electric organs are the hotness, but Jim Morrison turning "Gloria" into a song about getting his dick sucked makes me mad.  First of all, we all know that's what it's about anyway.  No need to be blunt.  And second of all, that's  <em>all</em>  Jim Morrison sings about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Background: I like some/ a few Doors songs but not all.  Mostly the instrumentation is where it's at for me.

      I know it is hard to believe some people have gotten their dick sucked enough and that they are writing about other things and that is why I don't believe it.  All human progress (A LAUGHABLE IDEA I MUST ADD) and human culture (HAHA REALLY) is based around the blowjob I could never get marybeth blowjob to give me.  My dad says its because Dairy Queen is the whore of Babylon, but he used to work in the industry till the scooby doo gang figured out he wasn't a ghost haunting a defunct ice cream factory that was in the way of some low income housing, so he might be biased.  He died 3 years after the Dairy Queen in our town got turned into an abandoned building and people didn't magically stop dealing drugs to each other.  So now I'm waiting for dick sucking to go out of business, so I can find a fresher reason for why I can't write a good song.

      The denizens of the Achewood premium content heliblimp might have gotten a chuckle if they weren't busy clinking glasses and watching Ray wonder if he should pants Roastbeef now that their relationship is defined as that not being possible. <br/> 
(Actually they are just watching the pants dream sequence and rewinding over and over again.) <br/> 
Runner up:  Ray won't pants Roastbeef because Roastbeef has a woman now, Ray wonders why this is and relates it in a humorous metaphorical way that noone who writes for a forum and not the website the forum is dedicated to is able to approximate.

      See, in the early days of the strip Ray could've pantsed roast beef at any time.  Ray could've done anything he wanted because Ray and Roastbeef were only defined as "cool" and "depressed."  My post was about how in the premium content forums, (that I've never seen and never read about here since I took a long break from posting) those uber rich enough to pay 3 dollars a month would get to watch an animated achewood cartoon (I forgot to include the words hi def to make you know it was animated) of ray imagining something from the early days of excitement, when he was a cardboard cutout who could still go anywhere and do whatever without getting run over by the snowball of decisions his personality amounts too.  The achewood premium viewers rewind Roastbeef getting pantsed(scratch that, now its wedgied) over and over, like the part in the youtube video where the kid freaks out that my friend can't stop rewinding.
