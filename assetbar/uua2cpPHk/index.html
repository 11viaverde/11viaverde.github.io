      This post implies that you are deaf, which makes your user name ironic. Unless it's referring to stereovision, in which case it's not ironic. Unless you have one eye, in which case it's ironic again.

Hey, here's a youtube video of that version of super mario 1 with different monsters. And here's that episode of Inspector Gadget where Penny asks Brain to "drop a deuce" on an unconcious MAD villain. I guess I wasn't lying. But still, too little, too late there, internet.
