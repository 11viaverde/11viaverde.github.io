      Here at m.assetbar.com/achewood we have our own literature of "ironic"/post-ironic first posts, including a very charming "FRIST POTS" image that should be a couple of days back in the comments. (I do not care if you ever find it.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the font that's used at least on my machine to display these assetbar posts, it's hard to tell an exclamation point from a capital "I", unless you look closely. Closer reading of your post didn't detect any reason to catch an xkcd reference, which I guess proves that I'm an xkcd noob even though I've read all of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Regardless, it is not necessary to use another webcomic artist's (or another webcomic's group of fans') preferred variant of "First post!" on this webcomic's message boards, especially when the variant isn't conspicuously unique. (Nothing against Randall Munroe.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
...Fuck along, now.

      Okay, guys, the pictures are gone now. This was fun, but you're all totally nuts. Now, I know you like us-- <em>I like you too!</em> --but I think that might be enough. <br/>

That said, let's all resume carrying on our normal Assetbar activities.

      There was an awesome one of tekende by himself, all awkward, and gangly, uncomfortable with the camera pointed at him, it may have been one of the most adorable things I have ever seen. It reminded me of the awkwardness of youth and the uncomfortable knowledge that we are judged by our appearance, but we feel we do not fit into the norms of societies definition of "good looking" even though we do.  <br/>

Or maybe I'm reading too much into it, maybe he had just done a 30 minute turd and bixschmix took a photo of him coming out of the bathroom. <br/>

      <em>Good Omens</em>  (p.87, pp.99, 1990): <br/> 
Most books on witchcraft will tell you that witches work naked.  This is because most books on witchcraft are written by men. <br/> <br/> <br/> The closest reference I can find in  <em>Wyrd Sisters</em>  (p. 57, pp.8   footnote, 1989 Corgi) <br/> 
"I've heard about witches," said the duke, who had spent the night before reading, until his bandaged hands shook too much, some of the more excitable works on the subject.* <br/> 
 <br/> 
*Written by wizards, who are celibate and get some pretty funny ideas about four o'clock in the morning. <br/> <br/> <br/> I expect there's a closer quote in another Witches book but I haven't been able to find it.

      I agree with your spelling, but prefer "Bishtek", with the "x" being pronounced like an Aztec or Mayan person ( <em>hecho en Mexico</em> *) would pronounce it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The French word is "biftec" IIRC. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*I would not equate someone (especially not someone who isn't a rich light-skinned person of European extract) with a product were it not a way for me to refer to a previous Achewood strip. Also, I've forgotten whether the Aztec/Maya actually pronounced "x" this way or whether it was the Mixtec/Olmec/Teotihuacan (or some mix thereof (har har)) who did it that way.  <em>[citation needed]</em>

      It's a skull with a UN helmet for sure.  The photo was supposedly taken in Yugoslavia/Serbia/Kosovo during that war they had there, although I cannot personally attest to the veracity of that.  The full photo shows the skull nicely posed on the hood of somebody's car.

      I expect they'll go something like this... <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>I am a very sick little boy. My mother is typing this for me, because I can't. She is crying. Don't cry, Mommy! Mommy is always sad, but she says it's not my fault. I asked her if it was God's fault, but she didn't answer, and only started crying harder, so I don't ask her that anymore.  The reason she is so sad is that I'm so sick. I was born without a body. It doesn't hurt, except when I go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
The doctors gave me an artificial body. My body is a burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that was the best they could do on account of us havin' no money or insurance. I would like to have a body transplant, but we need more money. Mommy doesn't work because she said employers don't hire crying people.  I said, "Don't cry, Mommy," and she hugged my burlap body. Mommy always gives me hugs, even though she's allergic to burlap, and it chafes her real bad.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will help me. You can help me if you forward this e-mail. Dr. Johansen said if you foward this e-mail then Bill Gates will team up with AOL and do a survey with NASA. Then the astronauts will collect prayers from school children all over America and take them up to space so that the angels can hear them better. Then they will go to the Pope, and he will take up a collection in church and send the money to the doctors.  The doctors could help me better then.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe one day I will be able to play baseball. Or maybe just use my lungs and heart, when the doctors make them. The doctors said that every time you foward this letter, the astronauts can take another prayer to the angels. Please help me. Mommy is so sad, and I want a body. I don't want my leaves to rot before I turn 10.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't foward this e-mail, that's OK. Mommy says you're a mean heartless person who doesn't care about a poor little boy with only a head. She says that she hopes that you stew in the raw pit of your own guilt-ridden stomach. What kind of wretched person are you that you can't take five lousy minutes to forward this to all your friends so that they can feel guilt and shame for the rest of their day, and then maybe help a poor, bodiless nine-year-old boy?<br/>
<br/>
Please help me. This really sucks. I try to be happy but it's hard. I wish I had a puppy. I wish I could hold a puppy.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You.<br/>
<br/>
Billy 'Smiles' Evans,<br/>
The boy with just a head.<br/>
And a burlap sack for a body.</em>

      Dude come on it's not like tekende is the main pervert of the internet at least not anymore I mean this is nowhere near creepy as the time he  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100102135012/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua9TflX9#comment_26">called blarghamagarky cute</a>  on the internet. Fact, I would say our boy tek has grown up quite a ways since that embarrassing-ass day. No longer is he just one of the nervous nerdy dudes talkin about a webcomic with other nervous nerdy dudes now he is one of the confident nerdy dudes talkin about a webcomic  <em>with his nerdy lady</em>  all whispering sweet nothings about givin her huuuuugs in that  <em>elegant, classical way</em> , no need for a lamp to illuminate their goings-on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But we have to admit that without grandiose expansive motherfuckers like him walking through life with their heads held high and their hearts takin on all comers  <em>Would the Great Handface Weekend even have been possible?</em>  so ain't no need for you to kill the computer like Cornelius in fact you should join me in congratulatin tekende on the progress he has made as an Officer and a Gentlemen I guess what I am trying to say is <br/>

      I dunno man are you sure about this... three days?  Shouldn't you give it a week at least?  Did you consult outside impartial counsel?  Was there a double-blind trial involved? <br/> 
 <br/> 
This might seem a little not nice to say.. let me see if I can phrase it more politely...  hmm okay, see people's personalities can be read on their faces, because different emotional states of mind result in different facial expressions, and as a result, people's facial muscles become formed to their average facial expressions.  It's not an objective science or anything, but you can certainly get a subjective vibe about someone just by looking at their face.  And so, well, to put it politely, and indirectly, I get a different vibe from both you and her.  I get the vibes of two people who are fundamentally incompatible.  If you two have kids, they will likely grow up to be as dysfunctional as certain Achewood characters.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
God sakes... Think about it... do you really want to have kids together?  What are you going to tell your future kids when they ask you (probably over a prison plexiglass phone) "how did you and mom select the joint culture and family value set that resulted in such dire circumstances?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Well, uh, Bobby-Ray, you see there was this internet chat room, and one day everyone started putting up pictures of themselves with their faces half obscured by their hands, and by the time the initial wonderlust had worn off and hormons had settled to a point where rational thought was again allowing us to pay attention to each other's personalities..." <br/> 
 <br/> 
If the reason you can't break up now that your reasoning facilities have been restored is that you have already conceived your children, turn to page 5. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If the reason you can't break up now is that you are too lazy, turn to page 17.

Even if you're wrong, that face vibes bit is the best thing I've read all week. Apparently hooking up with someone from the Internet is a bad idea, but it's a good idea to take advice from someone on the Internet who says your face vibes are fundamentally incompatible.

      If people got married at a courthouse and tallied the money they just saved, they could improve their marriage.  The man could spend all his ducats on buying her shoes, and she could spend her dress money on beer for him or breast implants (I am terrible).  Or perhaps, they could tally that money, then the cash they would pay for a divorce, then blow it all on cocaine and gin, and call it even.  I am writing this into a business plan, and will charge each of you for using my ideas.  Expect a bill soon. <br/>

      The funny thing is, whenever marriage gets brought up in conversation my dad goes, "Well, I'll give you a certain small amount of money, and if you're DUMB and want to spend it all on a huge wedding that's your choice, or if you're SMART and you have a small wedding and use it for travel or part of a down payment on a house or whatever with your husband, that's ALSO your choice." <br/>

      Expected. What I was actually trying to convey though is that you shouldn't take Achewood so seriously and look for continuity everywhere because sometimes it's obviously clear that he's just pulling plotlines out of his ass and that's fine, cause that's okay.

      I figured as much, I was just making a silly statement about the fact that Beef had lots of money, then gave it all up, and now is bitching about having no money, then frackin' continuity nazi lawbot comes in and the whole thing goes to pot, and now you're suffering the lames that should hav rightfully been his because you questioned Onstad's artistic abilities.  It could be worse, though, you could be that one girl who said that she didn't like the GOF that one time.  I had to up my lame limit to 200 in order to read her post.

      It has continuity in the places that matter, mainly in consistently developing the characters so that even little things they do are funny later on. Things like "But isn't Todd still in Hell?" or "Did Teodor ever get that lamp?" don't really matter as much.

      The beginning of Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" details how the poor immigrant family scraped together and borrowed a ton of money to have a 'veselija' or traditional wedding that was beyond their means. By the end, the entire family had either starved, died of disease, or turned to prostitution, except Jurgis, who became a communist revolutionary. <br/>

I agree with Sinclair about some points, but you can definitely tell The Jungle was written in 1917 or so... I don't know if that's much of an excuse for his mild racism.

      Hmmm... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think we can see from the opening frames of this strip that Beef had absolutely no idea how expensive a wedding was likely to be, and therefore didn't think he would need his greetings-cards money. Also, sometimes he doesn't really think of Molly all that much (and then regrets it later) so he maybe wasn't even thinking about his impending wedding when he got rid of the money. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But poor continuity seems a likely explanation too, if, y'know, you don't think of these talking cats as real people...

      Addendum: my wife's wedding dress was $500 out of our fairly small (75 guest), $20,000 wedding.  Roast Beef has got much bigger things to worry about.  Has he priced flowers recently?  For as much as wedding flowers cost I expected them to be made out of pure heroin.

      Yeah.  It was a nice, small, wedding, nothing extravagant.  We even got our cake for free (one of the wife's friends was a professional cake maker for a resort).  I dunno if it's just because we got married in Southern California... I've heard weddings are just that outrageous everywhere, unless you do the justice of the peace thing.

      There ought to be a prison for dudes who make a small fortune in the greeting card business, decide they can't keep the money, and get rid of it  <em>before</em>  paying for their upcoming wedding... <br/>

Honestly, Beef bitching about money right now is such a load of crap.  He could have bought Molly the finest wedding gown she could have wanted - but no, he decided to throw it all away because his pile of money  <em>plus</em>  his 15 minutes of fame were making him a target for gold-diggers... <br/> 
 <br/> 
At least if the greeting card thing had been written off as a dream sequence or something, it would make some kind of sense...  I guess we should just all forget it ever happened...

      I think it's about whether you can catch 'the clap' off the front of your pants.  Presumably, Beef has concerns about the cleanliness of bargain tuxedo rentals. <br/>

      I will admit that as a teen I was in air cadets. Banquets and mess dinners with the higher brass were basically a thing. Fortunately I was issued gross green slacks which didn't cost me a dime. Beef has a tux deposit to stress over, so he shall perform the "clap dance". This is known as the quickest possible movement of the hands to prevent warmed up Gazpacho soup from dropping to your lap. We called it the "navel prayer". <br/>

      Okay, to save those with upcoming nuptials some money I'm going to tell you a story. <br/> 
   When I got married my wife went to all the expensive dress shops with her mother and at those dress shops, they took photos of my wife in the dresses. Then they went to a professional dressmaker who has a great reputation and worked out of her livingroom, who created a custom dress from aspects of the dresses in the photographs. It cost about $1500 Australian dollars (at the time about $700 US and about 500 EUR). The dresses she had been looking for were a lot more, $1500  <em>was</em>  more than we had planned in spending but it sure beat the $5000 that the cheaper originals cost.

      I can conceive of people who want their wedding dress to be the item that ticks the 'new' box. But seriously - does the concept of the 'charity shop' exist outside of Britain? A year ago I found a real silk ballgown in oxfam for £14. State : brand new. It was red, it's true, but then I've never thought white a particularly flattering shade. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, hasn't anyone considered getting in touch with College of Art/University Photo societies, checking portfolios, and getting impoverished students, desperate for publicity, to do your photos? You could even get them competing. Get talent early, before they convince people they're fantastic, and start charging accordingly.
