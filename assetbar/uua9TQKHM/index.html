      On the flipside, his referring to you all as puppets  <em>(my last archive-trawl ended two years ago a number of strips before this one, so I'm naturally exempt)</em>  makes me respect him all the more. And that is despite his having lamed several of my posts in the past. <br/>

      Seeing who lamed what does not necessarily lead to subsequent laming.  It does shed light on the lamer.  For example, I know to ignore kylank, zem, and their ilk because those profiles exist only to hand out dozens of lames when their owner is in a foul mood.  That mood tends to follow poing/towl/whatever name that chooses today.  And I know what weight to give to neonaoneo's disclaimers.

      At the top of the comment section, just below the post comment box, there is a section where you can dictate how many chubbies it takes to highlight a comment and how many lames it takes to hide a comment.  I have mine set to 5 and 30 respectively, but it's really up to you!

      not to offend anybody, but one thing i personally find lame are the lengthy discussions of invented acheworld etiquette. this is a place for discussing the stuff of the comic and for engaging in general merriment, not reprimanding and putting up long defensive posts which are picked apart and repeating this every day. <br/>

just my personal ideas! anyway how do you view the lamers? i've never been able to figure this out.

      You can set you lame limit to 1, I guess...when a comment is hidden b/c it's been lamed too many times, then it shows who lamed it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You make a good point about etiquette (in that it often gets repetitive on these boards), but let's face it, this shit happens on every damn "internet community," and it ain't gonna stop anytime soon.  (And, as someone who's taken part in these arguments from time to time, I've just come to accept it.)

      looking at your ratings, I see that you have over two hundred and twenty strips rated as five.  I know there must be a lot of people who do this, because the average is almost always over four.  So my question is, don't you think this dilutes the meaning of the five rating?  I mean, what do you do then when there's something really good?  It can't be better than perfect.

      Maybe we really enjoy all those strips we rate as 5's.  Just because other people don't think they're perfect doesn't mean we aren't entitled to our opinions.  Doesn't voting the same as everyone else dilute the meaning of voting?

      Most achewood strips are fives. I mean a four is not that good.. it's an 80%, a B- of the lowest breed. As the typical achewood strip is 10-31 times funnier than  your typical entire newspaper comics section. <br/> 
I know it seems silly, but its just me trying to use the system honestly. To fix it they should create a 6 icon for those extra special strips whose icon is Beef with the pac-man eyes

      Therein lies our terrible problem.  We compare Achewood with every other comic we see, so obviously we dole out many 5s here.  We should be comparing Achewood only to Achewood.  In order for there to be 5s, there should also be 1s.  That may be a terrifying prospect but it is the only way to justly judge this beautiful comic of ours.

      It's entirely possible people are rating them five so that their favorite comics are easily accessible on their public profile page.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think there's also a cap on how many you can rate as five. I've noticed that certain strips I rated five suddenly are no longer voted on at all when I come back weeks later, presumably because all the ones I've rated since shouldered them out entirely.

      you know... hmm. I used to have a job that involved rating people on a 1 to 10 scale, recommending them for participation in a... a thing, in short. I had a coworker who would never give anyone a 10 (the best) because he said that someone might come along and be better than that person, then what would you give him or her? My argument was that 10 is part of the scale, to be used, but used judiciously. So as long as tens are present in numbers less than other ratings (and your overall ratings, when graphed, look something like a bell curve) then you be doing all right.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
220 strips rated 10 is bullshit.

      It's not really bullshit.  There are currently 1363 strips to vote upon, I believe.  220 5's is about 16% of the strips.  You can say that the 1-5 ratings correspond roughly to the common grading system (A-D, F); if you give a strip a 5, you might say you're giving it an A, which would be the top 10%.  16% is not grossly different enough to call it "bullshit," I'd say. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, you might not agree that 5's are like A's.  But, hey, that's why this voting thing is subjective.

      Ray has got my vote.  If he had proposed to declare war on Florida, even better.  I guess you've got to leave some things to the second term. <br/>

Also, not to contradict Cornelius unnecessarily, but the Declaration of Independence wasn't really this country's "founding document."  That role is occupied by the Constitution, or arguably, the Articles of Confederation.  The Declaration of Independence was just a particularly lyrical way of being a cock to a bunch of strangers in Britain.

Now the lame police will surely come knocking, as I have suggested that some of Onstad's work is not on a par with most of it. But I don't care because I am right, and my lamers know that as much as I do.

      Florida is sort of the Elephant Graveyard of America. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Literally.  Having never been there, I expect a labyrinthian obstacle course of ancient bones upon ancient bones, all hyenas chasing after me and my girl.  Death whispering me in the ear as I race, its warm breath just barely conveying its voice of fine ash - taunting me, hating me, claiming me as its own. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Every country has this.  In Australia, it's known by the magical name of "Queensland".  It is a place of mystery, purported to only exist in our minds. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I sort of don't want to go to either Florida or Queensland, now.

      Think of American states - Alaska is big, Texas is big, Montana's big, but only small bits are really majorly populated.  Everywhere else is farm country.  Australia's pretty analogous to America - just a fair bit more desert in the middle and we're a bit younger of a Western colonised country.  Only 200 years old - crazy huh?  The highest proportion of people live on the Eastern, coastal side of the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145632/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dividing_Range">Great Dividing Range</a> , or further south of the desert areas.  'Cause who wants to live in the damn desert?  That's where the white government sent the Aboriginals (the ones they didn't kill) - most of whom, like us, were smart enough to go "desert?  <em>Fuck that</em> " and lived on the coast.  But, we wanted the coast.  'Hey, you guys are natives, you live off the land and stuff, have this bit of....useless area.' <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway - QLD's big alright, but most of it is dry, boring-ass farming land that's barely fucking hospitable.  You know all those stereotypical pictures of the dry, red Australian countryside with cattle stations and corrugated iron sheds and crap?  Full of racist rednecks?  Yeah, that's the majority of Queensland.  Sorry guys, but it's true. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Except once you get near the coast.  Then it's a  <em>whole</em>  different ball game.  The coast is all famous for its beaches and entertainment - but even then, only small bits of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, most people live in NSW or Victoria.  Less in SA.  Even  <em>less</em>  in Tasmania or Western Australia.  And Northern Territory hardly is worth a mention.  I'm cool with living in Victoria.  Sure, we're arrogant, and sure, the weather sucks alot and the beaches are mediocre at best (Bells Beach is cold as all hell), but I'm cool with it.

      Like most Americans, all I know about Australian topography is what I've seen in Crocodile Dundee, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, and Mad Max.  The first two seem like Northern Territory, and Queensland sounds like Mad Max.  So what movie should one get drunk and watch to grok the landscape of Victoria, NSW, Tasmania, Western Australia, and Canberra?  Ever since I discovered that ABBA was huge in Australia I've always thought it must be a cool place.

      Heh, ironically the first Mad Max was actually shot in Sunbury in mid-Victoria, back when it was the middle of nowhere.  It's a thriving suburb now, just having sprung up majorly over the past few decades.  Not sure about Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, though.  They could've been shot anywhere in the world, really.  There's hella desert in Asia - who knew? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Movies for the rest of regularly populated Australia?  Hmm...can't think of many off hand that specifically use the backdrop of the cities as a major plot device quite like Croc Dundee, Priscilla, and Mad Max used their settings.  Most Aussie movies set in the cities will be "gritty suburban drama" types, so it wouldn't exactly be showcasing the glamourous side of things.  However, realistically - how many movies specifically showcase the wonderful scenery of American cities?  And the Australian film industry is much smaller and less funded than Hollywood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Canberra is not exactly much of a landscape, as far as I can tell.  It's the Aussie equivalent of DC - just a capital, all man-made, nothing more.  Ours, however, is just in the  <em>middle of fucking nowhere.</em>   There's a big man-made lake, lots of roundabouts, and hella relaxed laws on porn and weed - politicians, don't cha know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, like America, the landscape of Australia is extremely varied.  Everything that you've seen in the States, is down here - but replace the seasonal trees with gum trees.  And it doesn't snow in any major city except Hobart - it's generally a little bit hotter here, but it can get pretty freaking cold, especially here in Melbourne and in Northern Victoria.  But we've got plenty of mountain ranges with regular snowfall for those who want it.

      Interesting points.  However, in any given year Hollywood produces a half dozen films that get the local color of particular American locales correct.  Or at least they do it distinctively enough to fool you.  And there are more than a few that do it spectacularly.  Think of the Coen brothers: Fargo nailed the upper Midwest, Raising Arizona the Southwest, O Brother, the South, and I'm told No Country for Old Men captures border Texas pretty well (haven't seen it yet).   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Moving back to LA as an adult colored my thinking in this regard though.  Places that you've never been to and streets you've never driven on seem like the old neighborhood, so much so that when you revisit the old neighborhood, it just seems like a low-rent version of a studio backlot.  Everything everywhere else seems too small and clean. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just threw Canberra in there for the sake of completeness, but I assume it's like the Simpsons episode Bart v. Australia: where the PM floats naked in an lake.  I've always wanted to visit Perth, if for no other reason because it's so far from everything.  That's the main thing, apart from the never-ending rain, that makes Seattle interesting.  Its people act like they're on an island in the middle of the Pacific since there's thousands of miles of close to nothing between them and civilization.

I'm told that the prime consideration in the selection of the site that Canberra was built on was that it be more than 70 miles away from the ocean. The reasoning behind this is supposed to be that at that point in time, 70 miles was how far cannons could be shot from on deck. <br/>

      why so, sir? <br/> 
 <br/> 
yes, a lot of things about this election so far have been aggravating and stupid. but we have to keep a few things in mind: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. no matter what, the Bush administration is almost over. <br/> 
2. the neo-con movement is starting to choke big time. <br/> 
3. the Pendulum of Influence that has swung so far to the religious right in past years is beginning to swing back. after huckabee fails to get elected, and hopefully fails even to get the nomination, they're going to have to step down a bit and go back to the drawing board.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
look on the bright side of life!

      You've never met someone high on elevator paste because they've built up a resistance to it.  Every fix requires more paste than the last.  And it doesn't come cheap.  Those people with whom you avoid eye contact when you go downtown--the ones selling their toasters at the pawn shop, their plasma at the blood bank, or their bodies on the street corner--don't kid yourself, my friend, those people are doing it for paste money.  And every day, as you take the elevator to the second floor in your immaculate suburban office building, their blood is on their hands.  And their sweat, and assorted skin flakes.  Really, those guys make an absolute mess of the elevator when they try to scrape the paste out.  And you don't even want to know about the stairs.

      I'm still sort of surprised Florida has elevators. It seems like that's way beyond their current level of technology. They still ain't sure they can eat eggs. They got their top minds working on it, all sitting in a mud pit poking eggs with a stick and shrieking.

      I always thought of the idea of the Right To Bear Arms should just be the right to bear the same arms that they had back then - muskets and bayonets and crap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Upside: not as many people would kill each other in the States, as they would be subject to ridicule and deriding for carrying such a silly weapon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Downside: people would still kill each other, but the other people would thus die of fucking nasty musket-shot infections.

      But they did allow privateers to own some very nasty and state-of-the-art warships that pretty much put the hurt on merchant shipping. Thomas Jefferson said: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>%u201C%u2026every possible encouragement should be given to privateering in time of war with a commercial nation%u2026our national ships are too few in number%u2026to retaliate the acts of the enemy%u2026by licensing private armed vessels, the whole naval force of the nation is truly brought to bear on the foe.%u201D</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Banning a certain class of rifles is ridiculous, for reasons I won't get into here. But even ignoring that, we have Jefferson encouraging the modern-day equivalent of attack subs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So if Franklin, or indeed any of those Fathers we've gotten so far away from, knew about the destructive power we can bring to bear nowadays, they'd wonder why we didn't have a program to put an M4 in every house in America. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know I wouldn't B&E a house where the owner has an M4, much less want to invade a country chock full of people who own such weapons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can go on, but I don't think that this is the right place to discuss why gun control will never work. If you want to PM me though, I'd gladly and respectfully tell you more than you want to know.

      There can be only one explanation for Ray's inordinate grumpiness. He is actually the evil parralel Ray from another universe who has shaved of his "bloatee" to prevent being spotted. if this is the case we are about to enter a deeply unsettling phase in achewood's history.

      I fear that Ray would be similar to Dubya as a president. Ray surfs through life on a wave of good karma and luck, just as Dubya did through most of his life. Then, as he ended up in the Big Chair, the karma ran out, and things just stopped working out for him. One critical difference, though, is that Dubya became a born-again Christian before he entered office, and that may have interrupted the Flow. Ray would not have that problem.

      This may seem evident (hell, it may have even been posted before, and I overlooked it in my haste to say something insightful, but, in the end, unimportant), but this story arc reminds a lot of a certain  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145632/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/one_strip?b=M%5ea11f09b8576e606bcb5038dfdb92fb821&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fachewood.com%2Fcomic.php%3Fdate%3D09212007">"Fuck You, Friday"</a> , in which Ray's grouchyness led to an interesting discussion on class identity, authority and the priviledges that we still assume as part of our lives. As and aside, I'll mention the conversation was initiated by Doc Manflesh, and it remains the foundation of my respect for the man. <br/> 
First things first, let me clarify something. I love Ray as a character. I really do, even though, I don't want to. I want to hate him, I really do, but he's caring, upstanding, direct and to the point, although from his laid-back manners it's sometimes difficult to tell. At least, that's one side of him. For the purposes of this conversation, let's call it "Crunchy Stellas Ray". So, I love Ray. But, and this is a big but, I feel deeply conflicted for doing so. <br/> 
Let me clarify: he is also the living embodiment of everything that I despise of the human condition. He is rude, he is arrogant, he is stuck-up and petty. Oh, not  <em>all the time</em> , but when he is,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145632/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=12162003">he really is</a> . Let's call that side of him "Frat Boy Ray". Now, you may understand why I also hate Ray. For ideological reason, you may argue. It's not completely untrue, even. But I don't think it takes anything away from my point. In my book, that sort of holier-than-thou attitude is a strict no-no. Not acknowledging that the others are, you know,  <em>human beings</em> ? Bad move, Frat Boy Ray, bad move, specially coming from someone that once said that "no one should be a cock to a stranger. Ever". <br/> 
I could treat them as split personalities, something along the lines of "I love Crunchy Stellas Ray, but I hate that bastard Frat Boy Ray". But, truth is, they are both too deeply consistent, too identified to really distinguish between them. He is always Ray, only sometimes he is Ray to people that don't deserve him to be Ray to them (I love how that sentence turned out). In the end, it's the same problem I have with Rayne Summers, from Least I Could Do (yes, I read Least I Could Do, and no, I don't like the Perry Bible Fellowship. So sue me). <br/> 
But, I don't like Rayne. I read Least I Could Do mostly in the hopes that he will finally suffer a horrible death and let John take the friggin' spotlight. But I digress. I don't like Rayne, but I DO like, nay,  <em>love</em>  Ray. I love him to pieces. I'd love to be pals with him (mostly because he's filthy stinking rich, but still), And here's where the real meats of this meandering rant come. The fact that Ray's ideas, manners and, in general, existence enters in direct contradiction with every idea of reality that I have managed to forge in my short time as a sentient being, and I still find myself compelled to say: "Well, he has his moments". Even though I don't want to know anyone like him. And that is more a testament of Onstad's craftmanship than anything else, really. <br/> 
Sorry for the ranting, it was just something that had been in the back of my head since the start of the arc. Thought I'd share it with you. <br/> 
Also, I can't help but wonder, since where I live these attitudes would be frowned upon, and probably grounds for exclusion, and the two comics where the "adorable asshole" phenomenon has happened are american (which actually means jack shit, because all of the comics I read are american) just exactly how acceptable is it to be one of these? I'm just asking, no offense meant.

      Ah, undergrad.  Good times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But to address the rant, I don't think one should so easily dismiss the uniquely American character that Ray has become through years of explication.  His generosity combined with naiveté and blundering pomposity is what sets us apart as a people.  One cannot help but feel that the focus on Canadianism earlier in the arc and the focus on founding documents now is purposeful.  Geographically even narrower, Ray is such a Northern Californian I expect he roots for Cal every fall even though he presumably lives in the close vicinity of Stanford.  It's possible I'm reading too much into this.

      One of my best friends has a personality very much like Ray. It's the kind of person that you can't help but be drawn into, even if he says and does things at times that you would never dare, and might even frown upon. In fact, it might be  <em>because</em>  of that, no? <br/> 
 <br/> 
At least, that's what I've found.
