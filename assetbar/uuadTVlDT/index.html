      I've been looking at this comic for about 10 minutes cracking up at each of Philippe's expressions. Once one face ceases to amuse me, I look at a different one and the whole process repeats itself. I don't know how many times over I have read this now.

      Personally, I think that's an artifact of Early Achewood, when everything was a little different and not quite nailed down yet. Note that the text doesn't even mention Beef, Ray, or Pat -- so it was probably written even before they were introduced, or at least before Beef and Ray became as important as they did later. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A lot of characters were different in those days -- Cornelius was ignorant of alcohol, Pat spoke jive, Ray was a mysterious, shadowy figure -- I think it's safe to say that while mental impairment was originally part of Philippe's character, that's not true any more. Look at how literate he is in the Friday Facts! Even if Roast Beef edits it for spelling and grammar,   I defy you to find me a  <em>normal</em>  five-year-old who's that literate. I mean, in the Lyle-gets-glasses edition of Friday Facts, Philippe censors "fuck themselves" to "sin against their own bodies." Seriously, how many five-year-olds talk like that? Philippe might have a naive worldview, but I think he's really pretty bright.

      "Retarded" in its modern sense is also used to imply imply that someone does stupid things... whether through actual mental differences to average... or through simply being 5. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was kinda retarded when I was 5, but I grew out of it by the time I was 11. <br/> 
Sorta. <br/>

My mother wouldn't let me have gum. Ever. She figured if I did that I'd stick it on something or get it stuck somewhere.  <br/> 
I didn't actually even have gum of any sort until I was 14 and someone from the school I'd just moved to (before I'd had the chance to ostracise everyone) offered me some... and I was feeling rebellious. <br/>

To this day the best I've ever done is mix two packs of chewing gum with two packs of bubble gum... chew them up thoroughly... take it out of my mouth... stretch it OVER my lips and THEN blow it into a bubble. <br/>

      I can't with normal gum, but with really soft bubblegum (Hubba Bubba or similar) I can manage it. Normal gum usually comes in pieces that are too small, and pellet gum is too hard for blowing bubbles, I find. <br/> 
Not that I should be chewing gum on account of braces. (With that being said, it makes a tasty and less prone-to-falling-off-while-eating alternative to putting wax on sharp bracket.)

      What's with the word 'Whank'? I was chortling along to little old phillipe right to the point I read out 'Whank'. I couldn't work out how to pronounce the 'WH' sound in this instance. Is it like in 'what' or more like the pronounciation of 'whare' in Maori (almost like an 'f' for those not from the sunny south pacific...) Is Phillipe hitting his head on the door somehow reminiscent of masturbation?

      you have to pronounce the WH like you're an old guy trying to clear phlegm from his throat because it adds the extra emphasis to the whack (but this is whank not whack i am guessing whank is sort of like a whack that doesn't go up at the end or reverberate)

      Teodor's being kind of sadistic here: he  <em>knows</em> [ Phillipe's got a hare(otter?)lip, and this can only end in tears. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My problem was that i was too damn good at blowing bubbles, but i never got the hang of deflating them gracefully. I have really stupid hair in all my childhood pictures from getting gum stuck in it then trying to cut it out in a manner to avoid detection (Objective: failed.)  But O, what glorious bubbles did grow from my face!  Good times.

      I love Teodor's face in the last panel. He is definitely feeling bad for Phillipe, no doubt about that, but he's also wondering how someone could screw up blowing gum bubbles so badly as to result in head trauma.

      I did not learn how to blow bubble gum until I was 17, and thus can relate way too much with Phillipe here. I must have made that Panel 7 face a zillion times.
