      I had a discussion with my friend who likes Dan Brown. <br/> 
I said that my problem isn't really his prose--which is not so good--but the fact that he lies.  He says things like Leonardo was a flaming homosexual, and stuff about the Knights Templar that simply are not true.   <br/> 
And I get the argument back that "It's fiction.  It's supposed to not be true." <br/> 
They don't get my point.  Yes, the narrative is supposed to be accepted as false, but Dan Brown writes as though the historical stuff is true.  Like he did honest research.  And that is the douchey part.

      Yes, the flamboyancy thing.  I remember reading a few things on the Da Vinci code, and to be honest, this was the only thing that really stuck in my mind is the charge that he was a flaming homosexual instead of just a homosexual (which I believe is debated itself).  The big deal is that he would take a small rumor, and blow it up each time.

      let us also remember that "gay" as a sexual identity did not exist until it was invented by philologists in the 19th century so that, flaming or not, to ascribe that identity to da vinci is anachronistic at best. it is still very possible he had sex with other men, though.

      Sigh. No, sje. What he means when he says "gay" didn't exist back then is that there was no such thing as "sexual identity". People had sex, some of the had sex with just women, some of them had sex with dudes and women, and some of them had sex with mostly dudes. Usually they got married in any case. To borrow the language of the Republicans, there were "homosexual acts" but no "homosexual people".

      Ahh, I see. <br/> 
That Kinsey scale says that most people have same degree of bisexuality.  And I'm fine with that.  However, there had to be people back then that only wanted sex with men.  Are you saying that there was really no term for them?  At all? <br/> 
Now, he didn't live in Ancient Rome, but my Latin dictionary tells me that the word for homosexual is  <em>cinaedus</em> , which Wikipedia tells me is defined as "a man "whose most salient feature was a supposedly "feminine" love of being sexually penetrated by other men."" <br/> 
However, I can accept that people may not have identified as being gay or straight back then, at least not at significant rates.  Still, though, even if he didn't identify as gay, that doesn't mean he wasn't gay. <br/> 
Umm . .Republicans say that?

      Well that doesn't actually mean homosexual. It just means the, um, receiving partner, which I believe in ancient times was considered somewhat a somewhat degrading position fit only for slaves. Two men of equal status wishing to express their love were supposed to hug and kiss while rubbing one's junk between their partner's thighs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In any case, the definition doesn't specifically preclude an attraction to women. There were probably dudes who weren't at all attracted to women - there's no way to know. But even those dudes probably still got married and had children, seeing it as an unpleasant duty they had to perform.

      That one time I was in Wales on the way some place else, I ended up partying with the dude who picked up us hitch-hikers and treated my girlfriend and me to a night of Strong Ale aka Skull Attacks. Woke up on the deck of the guy's boat with three heavily tatooed fortysomethings blissfully passed out, with a little pain in my skull but none anywhere else. Also, everyone in Wales in my recollection is sporting a mullet and built like a rugby player, men and women.

I feel the same way about Paul McCartney (modern era).  I can't stand the guy.  Love his music though.

      There's really little reason to watch someone sing, when you think about it.  I've never really seen a Bowie video, for instance, except that "Dancing in the Streets" thing he did with Jagger.

      I thought he was all kinds of confused when it came to sexuality. Coming out as bi, then claiming that he wasn't really all that bi and just wanted to fit in because it was so the trendy thing at the time. <br/>

I think the idea that even his sexual orientation is a matter of current trends and style is perhaps more perfectly descriptive of the man than the truth could ever actually be.

      Considering he had a number of long-term relationships throughout his career, all with women, and has been married to supermodel Iman for like 12 years, it's pretty certain at this point that Bowie is straight, and the gay/bi talk was all for shock value. It was, at the time, a great way to get attention.

      You have odd ideas about ugliness. Ringo was ugly, sure. Paul was kind of odd-looking, but not ugly. John was pretty good-looking, and George was very handsome, at least until he started looking like Jesus or whatever. Bowie ain't ugly.

      Well, they all look drastically different throughout the sixties.  I think George was quite homely looking around 64, but when he started growing his hair out is when he looked best.  PAul was the most handsome in 69, but John just looked like a lazy hippie bum.  I suppose it isn't necessarily ugly, just odd.  John was probably the best looking one during the Beatlemania years, I think. <br/> 
Also, I am secure enough in my masculinity to talk about this.

      Sje, sje sje...  You dislike some of the stylings of Bowie based on your personal aesthetic taste...  Well hey, that's just kinda prejudicial of you..  If you wanna offer something of an explanation of your gut reaction I'm all ears...  More than likely however you probably can't articulate the who what where when and why behind your gut reaction...  Just know that artists often are contemplating the who what where when and why behind a culture's aesthetic sensibilities, and hopeful, even if they turn your stomach, hopefully they at least make you think a little bit.  If you try, maybe you can come to find some part of subconscious self that is attracted to the burlesque grotesque hetero&homo-erotic.... <br/>

I don't know why you think I am being prejudicial.  I never said that he is a stupid man, an evil man, a gay man, a idontknow man.  I just expressed that I don't like his style.  You are inferring that I think all these other things about him, when really I said nothing at all about them.   <br/>

      You guys have to remember that sje also considers tattoos on girls an automatic turnoff and basically doesn't listen to anything past the 70's. If I were to venture a 5-second diagnosis, I'd say he's been brought up in a fairly sheltered Leave It To Beaver-esque environment and has developed extremely boring whitebread sensibilities as a result. Sje, I know you're a swell guy, but you should realize that there are entire worlds of people out there to whom dudes wearing Polo shirts look equally ridiculous and worthy of derision.

      I'll grant you that it is fast, but hardly special.  I'm wracking my cheese-lobe to come up with better, but best I have is lame.  I stack two kinds of chips (huge-ass tortilla and Fritos Scoops), with three kinds of (hand) shredded cheese.  Chedder (sharp as you can stand), smoked Jack, and some Gruyere (for tanginess).  Chop up a few fresh jalapenos (I will fry your balls if you use those awful pickled, canned kind).  Fry some bacon and crumble to bits.  Layer the tortilla chips in a bigass plate.  Cover in a mix of the cheeses.  Dust with cayenne and paprika (smoked preferably).  Add scoops.  Recheese.  Redust.  Add bacon.  One more layer of tortilla chips.  Recheese (go heavy on top).  Redust.  Get a bottle of Tabasco.  Throw it away.  Microwave it til it is gooey (oven it at 300 if you really love me, then broil til brown).  This is designed to be eaten in a layered bite.  You should burn yourself.  You should burn others. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There.  Not too fast, but moderately special. I suppose there is a place in there for beans if you like that kind of thing.

      An excerpt: <br/> 
There was a knock. Eddie grasped the knob of the door but froze before opening it. What if behind that door he would meet a pop star from the eighties that he had seen far too many times before, or worse...a naked man bending over displaying his distended anus? That would be horrible, but no, that doesn't happen in real places, he told himself. Still he couldn't believe it deep down. He was afraid. He summoned his courage and opened it, there was an attractive woman there. <br/> 
"Hi I'm Charlene" She said with a bright and friendly smile "I just moved in next door and I thought I'd say hello..." but she was interrupted by the door slamming into her face. <br/> 
"Fucking spam" Eddie grumbled to himself.

      sje46 is spot on. If you assume that everyone's heaven is what they wish it to be (see Beef's fridge full of bread and guinness) then these C17th Welshmen have no concept of modern times, and being men of little or no imagination, exist in an afterlife which is just like ancient wales. I suppose Molly is just more curious and forward thinking than her community, so has migrated to a 21st century american heaven (modern wales is shite)

      Nacho chips could be produced fairly easily if he had access to cornmeal, an oven, and enough hot fat to deep-fry them. The cheddar (assuming that's what he uses) should be even easier. From what I can tell on the maps Cheddar isn't terribly far from Wales.

      Well, not three  <em>cents</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
In predecimalized British currency, one penny was equal to 1/240 pound sterling -- if you do the arithmetic, you see that thruppence would be worth .2 pounds of silver. As of May 4, the current price of silver appears to be floating around $13 an ounce: https://www.kitco.com/charts/livesilver.html  <br/> 
That works out to $2.60 for a single chip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, it's impossible to work out an Old Tyme value of silver in modern currency, but it would definitely have been more valuable and harder to acquire in centuries past than it is today. LN is totally ripping these guys off. <br/>

      Speaking of "normal furries" I have only one story about furries, and here it is: <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was at an outdoor camping festival.  I was talking to a buddy of mine in line for the showers when all of a sudden, out from the men's side of the shower shack comes a furry. Dressed in his costume, headpiece on, and soaking wet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"It" nonchalantly walked back towards the camping area.  As everyone in line was gawking and somewhat dumbfounded I waited a beat, then said "So...does it just shake off or what?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Everyone breaks up laughing, and I depart.  But I went back to my campsite, and suddenly I realized that I didn't really know how it was going to dry off. And that idea has haunted me for quite some time.

      Man, bein' shot dead mighta been the best thing ever happened to Little Nephew. He is getting his Ray on, now, full-time, without falter.  <br/> 
Also, who else is glad to see Onstad get his groove back. First real good arc in quite some time.

      I like to think of the holy trinity as the top execs of an intergalaxial(?) corporation. God is the chairman, makes all the rules and grand announcements. Jesus is in charge of sales and PR, all good news and platitudes. <br/> 
The poor old HG is stuck with admin, counting the fallen sparrows, organising plagues etc (and filing.) His (its?) job must be so boring and depressing that a little joke about his mates would be a welcome diversion. He wouldn't tell the others of course, (thunderbolting the messenger and all that.) But if you piss him off there's no way you'll ever get it of your celestial rap sheet.

      On the subject of Nachos: you would think it's one of those foods that's impossible to get wrong.  Chips, cheese, jalapenos, and add almost anything else you like...  but a surprising number of restaurants couldn't make decent nachos if their lives depended on it.  I've found it frustratingly difficult to sort out these fools from the people who  <em>do</em>  know how to put cheese onto chips and melt it.

      You would think that Chili's would make good nachos, or at least passable ones, right? I mean, given the rest of their menu, you would think at least they couldn't screw up nachos. But no. You would be surprised. Their nachos are terrible.

      It's been a long time since I had Chili's nachos...  Yes, I was surprised.  I can't recall if there was anything wrong with the nachos themselves, but what they were selling as a roughly $10 plate of nachos had about a dozen chips on it.  I got the impression that they'd prepared each chip individually, found it too labor-intensive, and stopped as soon as they'd made enough to almost cover a small plate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On The Border, if I remember correctly, used some kind of weird baked tortilla things as opposed to their regular tortilla chips, for their nachos...  And then a lot of places use cheese sauce instead of actual cheese - not the worst possible choice but a real step down.

      Back in the 80s when their menu was just a little yellow thing and almost half of it was burgers I was always perplexed that despite the name and preponderance of chili cook-off paraphernalia around they had pretty crappy chili. <br/>

      The "No Reservations" where Bourdain goes to Mexico has a scene where he meets "the inventor of the nacho".  What makes it great is that Bourdain makes no attempt to hide his contempt for nachos, and is even more sarcastic than usual in his description of the nacho-making process.  I don't think the inventor picked up on it, so hopefully there was no harm done, though it wasn't nice on Bourdain's part.  Made for good T.V. though. <br/>

Note: I like nachos.  This is not to be interpreted as any sort of anti-nacho polemic.

      Also, I think 5 white mana is a bit too much for a creature that's basically a 0/5 defender. I guess if your opponent had a deck that relied mostly on dick creatures, you could combine him with a Thicket Basilisk or Cockatrice, but I think those are illegal in the current block. You could also use a Stinkweed Imp, but that would require an even trickier color combination. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I recall having my own image immortalized in card form - I wonder if we can do a thing and make a full Assetbar set? Remember, you don't have to limit yourself to creatures. There could be a "BBCode Fail" instant that would work as a counterspell, shock image spells that deal instant damage, an "Ignore" enchantment that makes a creature unable to attack or block, or a "Political Debate" enchantment with a cumulative upkeep that taps all creatures for as long as it is in play. <br/>

      heh that is awesome thanks for the tribute Alexelbow but seriously it kinda sucks that you don't want to converse with me anymore.  you should really give it another try I know I piss you off and all but you and I we're not all that different in most respects really.  if we met at a hardees or a wendys or a burkerkingees I would not try to suck your dick I promisse.  it would just be a normal conversation between two dudes.    Even though I am related to one of the most notorious serial killers in American history I myself am not a certial killer and I would not try to cerial kil you.  promisse.  you know what you don't like me Alex?  Because I am  <strong><span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted"><em>unpredictable</em></span></strong>  and rust uninhibited and honest and I force you to think about the things you take for granted.  But I would be much more moderated and subdueded in real life.  I swear.  a conversation with me is basically just normal.  with sprinkles.  normal with sprinkles.  I swear to fucking God Alex you are going to forget what I look like and one day I will insinuate myself into your life just to start a conversation with you I know who you are on face book I will join some chat room that you are a member of and I will pay someone to interact with you maybe someone from a third world country who will work cheap until you trust that person enough to meet them in person and I will show up and pretend to be "bob_the_masturbator" or whoever from Assetbar.  you better think twice about everyone you interact with Alex because it could be me from now to.... INFINITHY!!!! so why don't you just give it up and agree to meet me in eprson  you still have me on your block list on facebook why don't you unblock me Alex just a little bit just chat a little bit it won't hurt I promisse it won't hurt one bit.

      I was thinking of something for loneal, but it was a mere shadow of the idea of using a flaming sword angel.  A chubber for you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm also trying to think of the most controversial card for glad.  He's completely hit or miss, some love him, some hate him.  Chaos orb isn't good enough.  Maybe some part of the Affinity engine or something.  I suck at this.  I know assetbar, and I know the chastity belt that is Magic, but I can't squish them together.

      I was also thinking something very much like Chaos Orb and I too felt it was somehow not quite enough. Perhaps you flip the card and if it lands face-up you win the game, if it lands face-down reshuffle it into your deck. Cards that allow you to search for Glad may not be used. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glad is, unlike many others, a Sorcery, not a Creature.

I mean, look at what they did (or tried to do) to Bay to Breakers. No booze and no nudity? What in the fuck is it then?

      You want obscure and more than one-hit wonders: go with The Orlons (decent 60's pop); ? and the Mysterians; Paul Revere & The Raiders; Vanilla Fudge; Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
More obviously, hit the R&B/proto-funk/soul bin with the Temptations, James Brown, Isley Brothers, Chambers Brothers, and Curtis Mayfield & The Impressions.  And, by God, find some Isaac Hayes albums...the man was sorely underrated as a singer and arranger.

      Well you said you already listen to the big bands but if you haven't before, give Blood Sweat and Tears a go. They where first described to me as being "like the band Deep Purple crossed with the musical Oklahoma". Fun party music. There is good stuff on the first four albums Although I am a big fan of  <em>And When I Die</em> ,  <em>Go Down Gambling</em> ,  <em>I Can't Quit Her</em>  and of course  <em>Spinning Wheel</em>  (Its a show stopper). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Related to BST you should check-out the album Super Session, perfect for a relaxing glass of red or a quiet shot of heroin. Donovan's  <em>Season of the Witch</em>  never sounded so good.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also you  <em>must</em>  check out Doctor John, at the very least first album Gris Gris, but also Desitively Bonnaroo and In The Right Place.

      I believe I've suggested it before, but I strongly think you'd enjoy Big Star. I mean, they're not really obscure, but they were influential and unappreciated in their own time. Still, they're also not well-known enough that the average person on the street has heard of them. They have a pop sensibility that I think will really suit you.

Listen. <br/>

It's Nacho Time. They are the most unhealthy food imaginable, short of a deep-fat fried reuben. Go up to the Hedonismbot's recipe. Write it down. Go to the store and purchase all items, including the tobasco. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your first nacho cooking experience, half will be soggy and half will be burnt. DO NOT LET THIS STOP YOU. You must power through to the second, third, and even nigh unto the ninth attempt, for true nacho-y goodness. You eat the first perfect batch yourself. Then you throw an excuse for your friends to eat nachos, because once they have partaken of them You Will Own Them, And Be The Coolest Kid In School.

      I'm curious to know what kinda people hang out on assetbar.  Are you attractive in real life?  Do you have a life?  Are you intelligent?  Are you educated?  Cultured?  Religious and political persuasions?  How much drugs do you do?  What psychiatric and/or developmental conditions do you have?  (Not that there's anything wrong with that!)  Okay obviously Gladi8orex can't be honest about this one because he isn't a real person he's just a character study.  But the rest of you all can maybe shed some light.  It would be interesting to see a random self-assessment of everyone.  Pretend you're writing a personals ad.  But don't lie!

      Awesome. I am my favorite subject of conversation!  <br/> 
17 year old female here. And American. <br/> 
 <strong>Are you attractive in real life?</strong> <br/> 
I think so. I'm cute and short and somewhat chubby. And I have big boobs. <br/> 
 <strong>Do you have a life?</strong> <br/> 
I do! Though I'm still in high school and I'm taking college classes, I have something of a life. <br/> 
 <strong>Are you intelligent?[b]<br/>
I am intelligent, just a bit lazy.<br/>
[b]Are you educated?</strong>   <br/> 
Yeah, Junior in high school, taking some college classes. <br/> 
 <strong>Cultured?</strong> <br/> 
Eh...I'm not super fancy, if that's what you mean. But I do have class. I like music and theater and comics and such. Musicals are my favorite things in the whole world :D  <br/> 
 <strong>Religious and political persuasions?</strong> <br/> 
Atheist and...uh...a democrat I guess. I don't...spend a lot of time coming up with ideas about politics.  <br/> 
 <strong>How much drugs do you do?</strong> <br/> 
None. <br/> 
 <strong>What psychiatric and/or developmental conditions do you have?</strong> <br/> 
None. <br/>

Now I gotta cross my fingers and hope I didn't botch my BBcode somewhere. Also, I hope I'm not the only one who does this. I'm curious too.

      Gladi8orrex's riposte is  <em>a premier vue</em>  rather insulting and sociopathic and sophomoric.  In actuality, however, our protagonist is like a delicate dandelion inside a fragile shell...  Afraid of being hurt, this is Gladi's way of opening up.  Will Gladdi ever come out of his shell?  Will any bitch ever see though his hard candy exterior and melt his soft wussy candy middle in her mouth?  Will Gladi ever be comfortable with his true self as a Jim Carrey look-alike in high heels and drag walking a giant poodle wearing a studded collar? (Gladi, not the dog.)  Stay tuned...

      I am not attractive, but hardly ugly. I have a life, with friends and a house and DVD collection and everything. I am intelligent, in terms of deductive reasoning and memory, but I'm also phenomenally lazy. I'm... sort of cultured, and I want to become a lot more so. I'm atheistic, but only opposed to organised religion to the extent that it indoctrinates people and is used as justification for acts of hatred. I don't know enough about politics (see: laziness) but I guess socialism sounds like the way to go really. I do no drugs, and very seldom get drunk. I don't think I have any psychiatric conditions. <br/>

      wow cool it's neat that some folks started talking about themselves.  It's always interesting to see the sorts of human connections we have with other random people we chat with who eventually become acquaintances and then friends and then subjects of restraining orders and block lists.  Ha ha just kidding. <br/> 
 <br/> 
well I guess I should pitch in and talk about myself: <br/> 
Are you attractive in real life?  <br/> 
   yep.  Chicks dig me... for my personality more than my looks.  I guess I'm average looking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Do you have a life? <br/> 
   not so much no.  A series of poor decisions and tough breaks has me where I am today:  poor, spending all my time working, and in a city where I don't know anyone.  No biggie, however.  You live and you learn.  Patience pays off in the end.  I'm gradually figuring out where I'm going with my life, starting a path of self-discovery, and that is more rewarding than any high-paying job or trophy wives.  Also, I'm a geek (which is a vice and a virtue) so my economic situation doesn't get me down so much, my disorganized management of my life doesn't get me down so much, because in my intellectual exploration of the world I'm always happy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Are you intelligent? Are you educated? Cultured?  <br/> 
  I suppose I'm on the high end of the average range of intelligence.  It depends what you mean by intelligence... book smart vs street smart... math smart vs emotionally smart.  My strongest area is abstract problem solving, my weakest is interpersonal skills.  That's kind of a bummer because I always wind up in jobs where you are not valued for your technical ability and where you live or die by your ability to play stupid political games. <br/> 
 <br/> 
educated?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
   some college... <br/> 
 <br/> 
cultured? <br/> 
 <br/> 
    some culture...  enough to participate in a range of cultural discussions, but if you put me in a room with some smart college kid from Europe or the U.K., I'm pretty much out of my league, especially when discussing politics. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Religious and political persuasions? <br/> 
 <br/> 
very liberal, and an atheist, but very connected with the idea of human spirituality, in a secular sort of way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
How much drugs do you do?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've never been drunk.  I don't do drugs.  I don't have to. I do take drugs to suppress raging emotional mania, which, as far as I can tell, is not unlike an acid trip.  So basically I have to take drugs to be 'sober.' <br/> 
 <br/> 
What psychiatric and/or developmental conditions do you have? <br/> 
 <br/> 
mmmm bipolar, and I masturbate a lot too.

      I will do this too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Are you attractive in real life?  <br/> 
Not really. I'm hardly the ugliest thing that ever happened, but you know. I'm getting married though, so I guess it doesn't really matter what I look like! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Do you have a life? <br/> 
Hardly. I have two friends, both of whom I've known since high school. I also have a big family, so I spend a lot of time with them. Basically I just stay home a lot. By choice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Are you intelligent? Are you educated? Cultured?  <br/> 
I'm slightly more intelligent than most of the people that I surround myself with, but when it comes to the entire human population, I probably fall somewhere between average and smart.  I was awkwardly smart as a child - I skipped second grade and scored within the top 5% on all standardized testing. Then high school hit and I didn't care anymore. I went to college for about a year, but then I decided that I hated college, and I quit. I do not consider myself cultured at all. I like plays. I hate ballet, and if you ever asked me to go to an opera with you, I would probably punch you in the face with incredible force. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Religious and political persuasions? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm an athiest. I went to Catholic school for six years, and I think that it was more of a deterrent than anything else. Organized religion as a whole sort of amazes me, though. Just because I don't agree with it doesn't mean I don't find it fascinating. As far as political persuasion? I think a woman should have a right to choose, gays should be allowed to get married, and stem cell research should be a top national priority. Those are my big concerns, and I'll support anyone who supports them. <br/> <br/> <br/> How much drugs do you do?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've probably been stoned a total of eight or ten times in my life. I've never smoked a cigarette, ever. I drink socially, but I was a borderline alcoholic for about a year when I was nineteen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What psychiatric and/or developmental conditions do you have? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I joke that I have OCD about things, but besides that I'm pretty normal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yay?

      Since I%u2019m a million years old, I will do this as I was at 25 or so. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Are you attractive in real life?  <br/> 
Yes, but painfully shy, and really wanting to grow more facial hair because when my head hair gets too long, I think I look like a girl. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Do you have a life?  <br/> 
Already divorced (no kids yet), working at a big ad agency in Chicago, going to England to chase after a chick, lots of weed, everything all the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Are you intelligent?  <br/> 
One point shy of Mensa. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Are you educated? Cultured?  <br/> 
Big Ten BA, used to read encyclopedias as a kid, could do with more travel and culture, but  I%u2019m usually the smartest guy in the room. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Religious and political persuasions?  <br/> 
Hippie communist in some ways, Goldwater conservative on others, very much opposed to organized religion, but very spiritual. <br/> 
 <br/> 
How much drugs do you do?  <br/> 
How much drugs do you have? <br/> 
 <br/> 
What psychiatric and/or developmental conditions do you have?  <br/> 
I have depression and was suicidal at 19.  I may have an addictive personality and am the child of an alcoholic mother who died when I was 24. <br/>

      Fall Out Boy's name isn't really representative of their musical nature or assumed image, as it was randomly given to them by some Simpsons fan at one of their first gigs. I am pro this fact. I am con the fact that none of them recognised the reference, though. <br/>

      Dude, you're way off the mark. If you're talking about hipsters, they STARTED liking MCR after The Black Parade. The whole reason I don't like that album is because it's  <em>too</em>  pretentious. The early stuff that I  <em>do</em>  like is fun, catchy, angsty emo with a goth vibe, and some of my best memories are of getting kicked in the face while moshing to them at the $5 shows they used to play around NJ.

      "fun, catchy, angsty emo with a goth vibe" is exactly how I would describe  <em>The Black Parade</em>  except replace "goth" with "glam". "Pretentious" would not be part of my description. I firmly believe that all of the bombastic, driving numbers on the album ("Teenagers" and "Mama" in particular) are quite tongue-in-cheek. I don't hear anything pretentious on the album at all.

      I'm glad someone pointed this out. The way I see it, the entire point of the last two albums has been to be over-the-top and dramatic--which is what makes them good and interesting, rather than obnoxious and pretentious. The differences between the three albums appeal to different moods/emotions--angst, theatrics, and morbid glamour, respectively--and I think that's what creates such polarized opinions on the band. If you can identify with the angst and morbidity, the music is appealing; if you look down on that as emo, or find the glam aspect pretentious, then you'll hate it. In other news, I think I have a bad habit of thinking about shit that's not important like I'm supposed to write a critical thinking essay on it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
tl;dr My Chemical Romance is pretty damn good and I'm glad to know that some of the most awesome people on Assetbar aren't on the hate bandwagon.

      I cannot possibly understand how a plate of tortilla chips with salsa on them is somehow classified as nachos. Nachos  <em>muft</em>  have cheese on them. I'm not saying they won't be delicious (of course, they will never be as delicious as real nachos), but they are not nachos. You are lying to yourself.

      A valid assessment. I found it rather hard to actually see and, well, it fit within the realm of the cat-cock we've seen before in the strip. <br/>

I usually put something like this in a link, but in this case, well, it wouldn't have worked. I think my record will show that I am not really one for the shock image. But a dude named Nacho sitting on his throne... man, I am only human.

      You know, I had a conversation about this on IRC.  Apparently a significant percentage (the majority--can't recall the actual number) of lesbians adult film actresses identify as being  <em>straight</em> .  And I said I doubt that, since they are, you know, having sex with people of the same sex, and chose to. <br/> 
They responded with the fact that they are acting.  A person can play a Nazi(Godwin'd!) in a movie and not actually be anti-semitic.  But they are not actually rounding up jews, they are just pretending. <br/> 
Then I was told that most people in the adult film industry are forced into it.  And, frankly, I think that is not true.  It  <em>might</em>  be true for prostitutes, but I doubt that too.  However, I have no evidence to back up my opinions.

      Well of course there are things you can fake and things you can't fake - there's that Roman comedian called Genesius who faked rites and prayers so well he ended up a martyr.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What's at question is here more identity and self-definition than activities. And when it comes to those, things tend to get a little more complex and fluctuating (e.g David Bowie) than a binary label we can put on someone based on their actions (even if a label is sometimes valid, helpful, and often a part of the definition of one's identity).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember someone saying here that she was bisexual and had never been sexually active - she could have said asexual, but that's not how she identifies. I can't label her from her actions (or I'd be denying her sexuality) but I can take her word for it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course there's always denial, and we can expect some from people who are in a situation where they turn physical intimacy into money-making performances, but we can also cut them some slack.

      I should point out that this isn't furry related, it is an Australian short film that was made into a short TV series about and guy who has problems bonding with his new girlfriends dog. It is just that the dog is played by a menacing actor in a dog suit. That said, I'm sure furries would get off on it about the same as a pedo would get off on clothing catalogues for kids. <br/>

Why do you think I'm a bigot? <br/> 
I used the term "waitress" because gladdi used it once, and it was pretty funny.  I thought people would recognize that.   <br/> 
I have nothing against waitresses. <br/> 
Now how am I a bigot again? <br/>

      Ahh, I see. <br/> 
The first one is my asking if black people have brown cum.  This is me pretending to be ignorant about sex and race, but is not actually saying that black people are inherently inferior or anything like that.   <br/> 
The third one is related to that.  Alreadyinuse (who is who wim9k is, and is a huge troll on these fora, or at least was, back in the day) protested against that post, and said it is incorrect to make such humor. <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>I object to sje's tongue-in-cheek conjecture that black people have black ejaculate. (I suppose that some readers will not be aware that this conjecture is in fact imbecilic, so in case you're wondering about the question, there's your answer.) I object because this kind of humor noire (no pun intended) is basically the parroting of pure ignorance and racism in an ironic way, and um, I'm not saying that this can never be done right, but I'm just saying that if you're going to try it, it's hard to get right. Just ask Michael Richards.</em></div> <br/> 
He says that the humor is very difficult to do right, not that it is wrong.  That is, I was doing it in an ironic way.  Now I ignored all that and addressed the first line, and said that I said brown, not black, "you stupid mexican". <br/> 
I have no idea if he is Mexican, but that's not the point.  If was a very oblique and obvious attempt at humor. <br/> 
The second one was a picture I found on Reddit, which had to do precisely with what they were talking about, and I wanted to show it to people.  I never said or implied that I agree with such a message.  But the fact that I got 8 chubs and only one lame shows that not very many people on Assetbar were offended by it. <br/> 
But look, all of that is irrelevant.  Many people make racial jokes.  What makes me a bigot isn't how offensive the jokes are, but how I really feel about people.  I am a very liberal guy, if not politically correct.  I'm not going to go up to black people and call them the N word.  But I'm not goin g to refrain from a joke.  Most of the time, people chose to be offended by stupid stuff.  And they deserve to be offended.  If they know who I am, they know that I am not a racist or misogynist.   <br/> 
Now shut up, woman, and make me a sandwich.
