      Good god that's awesome. I can't help but imagine it as the intro to an Achewood cartoon on Adult Swim. I know other people have mentioned something like this, but it probably won't happen because it takes more than one writer to produce a whole episode every week and Onstad seems to have trouble coming up with content regularly as it is. Too bad.

      I once had a dream about an animated Achewood movie.  The voice actor for Spongebob did the voice of Philippe.  It was a most Terrible dream and I awoke with some sense of relief that it wasn't reality.

      I gave him his second. I assumed he was being all ironic and postmodern and shit. Why you guys got to be such cynics? Maybe he was just willing to take the risk of laming for the sake of some real, stop-and-think humour. I respect that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, taking advantage of the high comment placement to post my feelings on the strip, I enjoyed the humour and the simple espousal of some good, old Achewood values. But on the other hand, I kind of filed the dialogue under "things that sound like what the characters would say."  <em>Not inspired.</em>

      Love Clits is memorable in it's simplicity. <br/> 
Kind of like that 'Portal' game from half a year ago had some genuinely funny lines, but mostly, people would just quote that god damned 'The cake is a lie' bit over and over, whenever cake was mentioned. Particularily on birthdays, but any damn old time, even devoid of context. <br/> 
It is people like this that let people like Will Ferral believe that bellowing on top of your lungs is adequate enough of a joke to relay for the upteen-hundredth time. <br/>

      Alright FINE I'll give you a  <em>proper</em>  GLaDOS quote. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I would just like to point out you have been given every opportunity to succeed. There was even going to be a party for you. A big party, which all your friends were invited to. I invited your best friend, Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn't come because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn't come either because you don't have any other friends, because of how unlikable you are. It says so right here in your personnel file: unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner, whose passing shall not be mourned. Shall. Not. Be. Mourned. That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says you were adopted. So that's funny too."

      It certainly sounds like what the characters "would" say, but my opinion on this and similar strips is that it serves to strengthen their personalities, reinforce who they actually are, to serve as a catalyst for strips in which happens plot development and character enhancement, so I'm quite chuffed to see things go down completely as normal every once in a while.

      He worked at the Plaid Pantry, which is like 7-11 but worse. Some people were smokin' crack on the steps outside (classy) and when he went to kick them off he got a big whiff of crack smoke. We spent the next thirty minutes trying to figure out what had happened and if he was really on crack. Fortunatly, this hadn't been his first experience with the drug, so we were pretty confident. <br/>

Moral: Don't work a convenience stores unless you like crack, in which case you should totally go for it.

      Explanation:   <br/> 
 <br/> 
My roommate and I were four hours drunk at 2 am, and we decided to stumble around the neighborhood.  (It is a moderately small city, so there was little fear of murderings.)  We found a man from circumstances working on his truck in an alley and started up a convo.  It turned to politics, and since it was 2004 at the time, and myself a poli-sci major, I wanted to pick this poorman's brain about why anyone would vote for Bush ever ever.  After about 15 minutes, my roommate grew bored and stumbled home to pass out.  I continued to drunkenly chat with the guy, speaking too loudly about freedoms and taxes and etc.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The convo eventually hit a lull and the man said to me "Do you smoke?" and, being a habitually smoker of the green stuff at the time, assumed that was what he meant, and replied in the affirmative.   He led me into his home, which was probably one block from my house, so I was unconcerned in any way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Walking up the stairs, I began to grow uneasy:  the walls of the stairwell were hastily nailed down unpainted plywood and there was a strong smell of disinfectant.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
We walked up the stairs to his apartment, which started with his kitchen.  It was completely bare except for a small radio that very softly played a conservative talk station, but not one of the usual FM angry ones, one of the AM racist ones.  The only other visible room of his house was his living room, which contained no less than  <em>five</em>  full grown rottweillers, highly agitated as though expecting something, held back by only a child-safety gate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When the man pulled out the crack, I felt it behooved me to follow along.

      I was going to chubby the moment i saw, "...man from circumstances." but opted not to, as too many people try talkin' like Onstad to get a head, here. Then I read the analysis of the AM vs FM radio stations. Proper chubby. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am - however - curious as to said racist:angry::AM:FM correlation.

      I feel it is a mainstream/underground kind of a thing.  Not that all conservatives are racist, or even all conservative talk show hosts, but there is a deadly strain that speaks coded language in the mainstream and lets fly with the hate the moment they are by themselves. I have only ever found the worst of it on AM radio.

      There was a time when I was hammered downtown and I had a bottle of Dickle burning up my pocket. I had about a pint of tequila in me and the world didn't look too many shades of right, so I was sitting in some alley watching the glitterati and the smokehounds wander from bar to bar. Some old homeless guy did a careening dance towards me, stopped, and said, "Everything sand." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't say anything. Then he said, "You know?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"What?" I said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Everything sand," he said.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Everything, huh?" I said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Yeah," he said, and nodded. "Got it clutched to your chest. Little handful of moments. Hold it real tight, all these little seconds, and you run around all over the place and it slips through your fingers. Your fingers, just crying time, slipping through like sand. That the way it be." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I nodded and was kind of disturbed at how much sense that made. "That's so," I said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He took in a deep breath, eyes wide as saucers, and let it out. "You know it is damn near impossible for a man to get his drink on these days," he said to me.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just looked at him and thought to myself,  <em>Well, goddamn, I guess this is going to happen,</em>  and then I pulled out the bottle of Dickle. He raised an eyebrow at it and I nodded, and then he sat down next to me and we drank the rest of the bourbon in the alley and put the world to rights. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Man stank like you wouldn't believe. When some cops ambled by and told us to clear out he talked them down pretty slick, though.

      Ah, the 'homeless philosopher'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A man so filled with ideas, with theories, with metaphors, and with zest that he can spend hours forgetting the basic human needs and ponder the world for what it is. <br/> 
A man whose comprehension is as striking and poingnant as his own scent, finding and discovering things anew daily for the entirety of his majestic existance. <br/> 
A man with endless ability to teach, but with unsurmountable walls based on simple financial differences barring him from creating expansion of the human mind throughout the world. <br/> 
A man with ideas so incredible that implementation on a grand scale could correct problems which humanity has learned to accept through repeated failure of lesser solutions. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A man with one hell of a love for booze.

      Popeye brings up childhood neighbourhood politics for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. My sister was banned from watching Popeye because she started talking like him in regular conversation without trying to be funny (she was at that phonetically developmental age). <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. My mother used Popeye to convince me to eat spinach, and beyond all logic, it somehow worked. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. The 3 Stooges were banned in our neighbourhood because one kid hit another kid on the head with a hammer. <br/> <br/> <br/> That last one actually has nothing to do with Popeye, but Popeye always reminds me of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't care what people say, Shemp was alright.  He was no Curly, of course, but he was relatively funny in his own right - although he was essentially the same as Moe.  Larry is my favourite, now that I'm older and can further appreciate the guy that gets his ass kicked all the time.

      Dude this is probably as good a time as any to mention this I don't know if I mentioned it before but back in September I actually met Terrence Howard <br/> 
 <br/> 
I went to this comics convention in nearby Maryland known as SPX or the Small Press Expo which is basically all about indie comics and stuff like that and as I was getting my cash at the ATM, he he walks by, a suit in his arms, and asks everyone in line but no one in particular for directions <br/> 
 <br/> 
But everyone just kind of stared at him and it was clear he was getting no help from us. I said, "Sir, can I shake my hand." <br/> 
 <br/> 
He nodded towards his arms and said "My hands are kind of full, bro." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Undaunted, I said, "Can I...can I  <em>bow</em>  to you?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Clearly this man was sick of my rappin mush but he just said "Uh...how bout I just give you a pound" which we commenced to do and he was on his way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was struggling to figure out what Terrence Howard was doing at SPX later. Maybe he was there to promote  <em>Iron Man</em> ? But there is nothing small press about that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I later saw him fully dressed in a tux, standing out of the way while a man took a picture of a new Bride with her associated Maids. "Oh shit," I thought. "Did Terrence Howard  <em>just marry a white lady?</em> " <br/> 
 <br/> 
That evening's IMDB search showed me that I was wrong and that Terrence Howard has been married for some years to a woman of Our Mutual Race and they have produced the appropriate consistent offspring as a result so he was probably just some other gentleman's groomsman  <em>but man.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now as a final disclaimer I am saying that I do not judge other black people for marrying outside the race in fact I would have to be the first person on the chopping block if such a thing is a real offense but when you are dealing with a man with Terrence Howard's  Blackitude there are things like this that will surprise you whether you are a Vietnam vet who has spent the last thirty years in strip clubs trying out all the drinks on the menu and being on a first name basis with each individual vagina or a baby boy just seeing his penis for the first time But this is assetbar I know and accept that most of you probably cannot relate to this situation due to your whiteness but that is my story and that is how it must be told.

      I guess Final Fight is hella poignant to me because that's what I was playing when I had my once-in-a-lifetime god-of-the-machine experience.  You know the one; we've all been there.  Playing on a single quarter for fifteen, twenty, thirty, forty-five minutes.  A small crowd of greasy preteens gathers around, slack-jawed and glassy-eyed with awe.  The enemy  <em>cannot bring you down</em> .  And of course back in the day it was just mashing the attack button as fast as possible, but it still felt special.

      My grandfather once told me a story about those cigarette machines, which may be of interest to the Assetbar community. Back in the 60s or whenever, he used to come up with schemes for making more money to supplement his income as a supervisor as Exxon. He and a friend bought some cigarette machines and sold them around town. However, the price of cigarettes went down 2 cents, so their machines were shorting people. They either couldn't afford, ar didn't know how to fix this, so my grandfather invented some sort of device for inserting two cents into the clear plastic slip of the cigarette packs.

      When I was 5 or so, I remember seeing those vending machines in most family restaurants. Usually they were in the front entryway, completely unsupervised. There was nothing stopping any 10-year-old from buying a pack of smokes. And this was only 20 years ago. It's amazing how much attitudes have changed about smoking in such a short time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
BTW, many small-town Pizza Huts haven't changed a bit, aside from no longer having the cigarette machines. My local one even serves beer in those amber pebbled plastic tumblers!

I don't know, maybe that's not true. He just feels more familiar. He's more superdepressed than he has been for ages. It must be that Molly makes him happy (well, happier), and nearly cheating on her has brought him down again. <br/>

      They're talking about a yummy hot sauce originally from Thailand called Sriracha.  The kind we get in the USA is from Rosemead, CA - a really shitty town.  It is widely available in every ethnic restaurant in Southern California, and apparently elsewhere now.  It has a picture of a rooster on the front.  It makes nearly everything taste better.  I knew a dude who claimed that he almost married the heiress to the cock sauce fortune, but he was worried that she would kill him, because she was both bipolar and jealous, and he was a habitual liar.

      That makes me think of this girl I knew who almost married Ronnie Tot, heir to the Weiner Tots empire.  Her father, who loved Weiner Tots, was absolutely elated, but then the marriage fell through for some reason.  Wait a second, that's nobody I knew, that was Kelly from "Married with Children".  My story is completely irrelevant here, apart from you reminding me of an awesome TV show.

Seriously though, Sriracha is delicious.  Cube one chicken breast.  Cook in frying pan with thinned sriracha sauce.  Wrap in flour tortilla and consume.  Cheese slice or sour cream optional.  Excellent bachelor cooking.

      The thing is you've only read 107 strips, so you're not really qualified to say it's the greatest thing he's ever written. Trust us, read more, I can 100% guarantee that you'll like plenty of other strips better.

      achilleselbow, you should know by now that the number of strips read as rendered by assetbar doesn't mean shit (people can read strips without being logged into assetbar, and newbies can use alreadyinuse's script/bot whatever to trump up their assetbar count, etc.)

      I been real sad lately, too. I feel kind of like my life is a homemade pizza and like, the dough is made from scratch but whoever made the dough didn't activate the yeast so the bread never rose and like we put all the toppings and made a great sauce but the dough was just like a flat piece of crumminess and that's all people notice is how sad and crummy the dough is even though the sauce was all prepared the night before so the herbs absorbed into the tomato sauce and the cheese is freshly shredded organic mozzarella made from a local farm and   all the veggies were like fresh and local, too. But like, once we realized the dough wasn't gonna work out, all these expensive perfect toppings were just an expensive waste and like you could have gotten a dang boboli crust and people would have appreciated you more but no, you spent hours and hours on this and it's just crummy. Then I think about owning a pizza parlour like in this strip and I just get real sad cuz I'm sure there would be lots of days where the pizza just kind of disappoints.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like, your special is a whole  wheat flaky crust topped with a creamy garlic and goat cheese sauce and finished with prosciutto and homegrown ramps and you recommend it to someone who felt like something different from the usual pepperoni but they can't appreciate the work that went into the pie and you hear them mutter under their breath "I should have just gone to Papa John's!" after their first bite and you die a little on the inside and just zone out for a while kneading some dough before you realize you've shed a couple tears and they're dripping into the dough and the waitress is calling another order and you wish each little pizza you made was a whole new world you could run to when you wanted to escape the sadness. And you start making this pizza and you imagine yourself on a little world and you're happy for a minute just running around on the crust, swimming in the sauces and stuff before you realize that you're still sad, but now you've pushed yourself away from everyone and you're just sad and alone, making pizzas.

      well uhh... I can't remember out of where that particular demand originated.  I'm not even sure what this argument is about.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
but yeah don't get me wrong I don't mind boring people when I said boring up there I meant evil boring or self-centered boring.  or shallow boring.  I suppose even those people have feelings too, but, they are also evil and self-centered, so, I guess, being around them is like walking on egg shells or something.  I dunno.  all the evil boring people are on my ignore list now so they are already fading from my memories. <br/> 
 <br/> 
hmm but yeah, like, I am not too original myself either.  Not many people are I guess.  Everyone is original in their own way.  Everyone has their own special niche.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
obviously you must have some gears turning a little funny or you wouldn't be reading achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
plus you're canadian.  By definition you are special just because of that.

      A little sensitive on the boring issue. Many of my friends are boring. You wouldn't believe how many conversations I have to have about car stereos. That was not an Achewood reference, I mean literally. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While you did not issue any demands in a literal sense, you did have yourself a little scream into the abyss, there, and I thought perhaps you demanded satisfaction of some kind.

      Nah, don't worry. I see the inherent metahumour, now that I know to look for it. You just seem to come on a little strong is all. The school girl thing, for example. I see the humour in sneaking a horrifying concept into a speech seemingly intended to show pathos, though you could have done as well with a more familiar, if less inspired, trope such as incest or murder. <br/>

      but.... but I want to know where you live Davey... <br/> 
 <br/> 
heh.  um well anyway, yeah, the downside to all my ranting is that now it's impossible to know how much of me is sane and how much is wacko and conceited and arrogant... and I'm sure that most people would not want to meet me because they'd be turned off just knowing that there are seeds of arrogance and self-agrandisement in me somewhere. <br/> 
 <br/> 
but yeah, there was some honest arguing and bickering in all of this at times, and man, I tell ya, that is just lame in the end.  I shouldn't do that.  It's like yelling at someone who cut you off in traffic.  Yelling at someone who cut me off on the information superhighway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
yesterday I tailgated this guy who was pulling away from a stop light to avoid slowing down too much, just to save gas and because I'm lazy.  At the next stoplight, I had already forgotten about it, because it seemed like no big deal to me, but he pulled along side, and complained that I came up on him rather fast.  I was confused and didn't know what he was talking about, and I apologized and said I must have had a moment of inattention.  And he's like 'yeah, and you would have hit me if I didn't move and you would have killed me too.'  And he had this little tiny dog he was holding.  He was driving an expensive looking car.  a little rag top deal.  what is it about dog people?  They just aren't as nice as cat people I think.  I've never had anyone with a cat in their car yell at me before.  So anyway, next thing he says is "you're a fucking nimrod" or something.  I don't remember the particular insult, just that he prefaced it with "fucking."  Maybe it was moron.  "you're a fucking moron."  and I'm like, in a surprised voice "calm down sir..." and he repeats himself "no!  you're a fucking moron and you shouldn't be driving"  and I just kinda looked at him like uhhh... ya know not hostile or anything, just like, gee sorry guy I can't quite follow your reasoning there kind of surprised and a little shocked that he would say that.  I mean, he was a sort of santa clause looking guy.  A little stocky, had a beard.  in his late 50s.  All the stocky guys I've known with beards in their late 50s are pretty reasonable.  usually by that age in life you mellow out a bit.  So then the light changed and he drove away, and as he did I remembered his license plate, and I'm like, oh, he's talking about the last light... that's the guy I tail gated.  and he was so over-hyping it.  I didn't almost hit him, I didn't come up fast... the distance slowly closed between us as he was pulling from the light and I was approaching, until I had to hit the brakes to slow down a bit, and we coasted at the same speed for a second until his acceleration caught up with my deceleration and then I was able to get back up to speed again.  He was in a tiny car and I'm in a 1 ton van, so, I guess it might have been somewhat intimidating for him to look in his rearview mirror and see nothing but the front grill of my huge vehicle that close to him.  So like, gee, okay, for future reference maybe I won't tailgate people in small vehicles so closely.  It was nice of him to let me know that.  Until he got all obscene about it.  Anyway.  What can ya do.  That sort of thing used to really bother me, but I've mellowed out a lot over the years.  What can I say.  In general, I suppose this country is a little bit more hyper and aggressive in it's interpersonal interactions sometimes.  And now we have a generation of soldiers coming back from a war too.  That isn't going to help mellow things out any. <br/> 
 <br/> 
maybe that is why the people on assetbar are mean to me sometimes.  maybe they are war vets who have post traumatic issues.  Or maybe they are actually in iraq right now.  Maybe if they used that energy for stopping terrorists instead of flaming people on the internet then we could have a nicer internet and the war could be over sooner and they could all go home.  oh well.  what can you do.  you can't make people do what's best for themselves.

      Two posts in one day's strip for me...I guess I'm getting sucked into these forums more now.   <br/> 
In reply to this:  While inuse has used a very shocking example to make his point, his assertion about honesty holds fairly true.  Let's take an example from the strip instead of school girls.  Roast Beef does what inuse says in most strips: "there is no such thing of course, but by completely honest, I mean a stream of consciousness that shies away from nothing, that lets it all hang out, that expresses every whim, idea, thought, emotion. Of course it comes out looking like sheer lunacy."  This is Beef's character, and why he is so popular with the readers.  Beef says things we either like to see said, or would like to say ourselves.  For evidence, look at the reactions to Beef comics in assetbar.  These reactions are full of attempts to imitate Beef or just express that they love what Beef says.  I would assert, and perhaps inuse would agree, that it is because Beef is honest.   <br/> 
Whether inuse has been playing off that concept from the start, or whether he just stumbled across honesty as a way to shock more people, I am not qualified to answer.

      I never have a problem with people who like to martyr themselves.  Survival of the Fittest at work.  I would love to use the phrase Social Darwinism, but that has too many nasty racist connotations to it, and skin tone has nothing to do with Survival of the Fittest on any level.  So, I need a new term for people who are so socially inept that they knock themselves out of any social acceptability.  Any suggestions?

      The sad part is he's actually convinced he's the smartest person on here, even though we have people who are at Oxford and Yale. He really thinks that his long self-conscious diatribes make him some kind of genius artist when all it is is just self-indulgent attention-grabbing, and that people hate him because they can't understand his use of amazing words like 'meta' when in reality they just think he's pathetic and trite.

My 'Hut' experience also featured two managers who were highschool friends, who put nasty things into a pizza of a girl who had picked on them in school. <br/>

      Onstad captures the sights, the sounds--and the smells--of the 1970s sad pseudo-Italian Pizza place, but the outstanding question is of course the crust.  Deep dish so thick you tore up the roof of your mouth eating eat, paving the way for the hot cheese and sauce to further the damage?  Or thin crust whose bottom was dusted with corn meal that was often not ground finely enough, making the whole experience more akin to toppings on sandpaper?    <br/> 
 <br/> 
Were these clapped out places really "parlors," however?  Rather once dignified Italian places that lost their immigrant clientele and sense of place?  This to contrast with the Shakey's model of linking a Gay-90s theme to pizza, as if those somehow were the most natural combination in the world.

      We had a Shakey's in my hometown.  I think I remember when it opened.  It was so dark inside, and there was indeed a player piano and a guy with a banjo.  Later, it was much lighter inside and had brass railings and mock Tiffany lighting fixtures.  It was there for years, but it's gone now.

      Minor Threat is actually  <em>completely</em>  listed as one of my favourite bands in my AssetBar Profile. My main attraction however is that Out of Step (the LP) is awesome in terms of vocalizing the pain and frustration that arise from withering friendships, sort of perfectly straddling the line between anger and sadness. The earlier, balls-out angrier, straight-edgier stuff I don't find as interesting.

      So are either you or catgrl actually sXe? I knew a lot of people who were back when I was into the 'scene' and I thought it was kind of lame at the time, but then when I ended up at college surrounded by drunken fratholes whose idea of a good time to brag about the next day was puking in the bathroom sink, which wouldn't get cleaned till Monday when the janitors came back, and I suddenly understood its appeal as a statement against that kind of culture. I have trouble committing to abstract codes of conduct though - I enjoy a good cider or cocktail once in a while, and I think hallucinogenics are rad.

      In the sense that I don't drink, do drugs, smoke, or have casual sex, yeah, I'm straight edge. When I stumbled across the term/idea, though, it was more something that described how I lived at the time anyway.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I try not to be too much of a douche about it, but something about that sort of lifestyle sits very wrong with me. I never really felt comfortable with the idea of needing to change how I interact with or perceive the world. I think it also has a lot to do with my general distrust of losing any measure of control over my actions.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And if I enjoyed the taste of alcohol then I might drink socially, but I really don't and I always find there are better, and usually cheaper options as far as drinks go.

      I've found that out of all those things, the casual sex proscription is the easiest to follow and the hardest to break. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe the straight edge thing is more visible in the American scene? (I surmise you're British because you said "university" instead of "college" in your comment below) I mean I remember in high school it was pretty much the norm if you were into that kind of music, though I think most people predictably dropped it after they went to college.

      Britain's got a huge binge drinking culture, (to such an extent that we gave George best a second liver, possibly the dumbest investment of all time),  so sadly I think people who forswear intoxicants etc feel marginalised. <br/>

I personally think intoxicants are rad though.

      I live in California, and I did not know cigarette vending machines existed until today. I basically didn't even know cigarettes existed until fifth grade, when they told us that anyone who smoked was going straight to hell, and that if you meet someone who smokes, you should never talk to that person again because they forsook human contact when they chose their precious cancer sticks and they are only getting what they deserve. One time my mom smoked a cigarette at a party, and I had to hide away and cry for her tar-coated soul for, like, a half hour.

      I loved the ambiance of crappy pizza joints, and I don't even like pizza.  They seemed to bubble out of a country where the land was cheap and the labor cheaper.  That was a place where a viable business model involved keeping a dark, dank hall with multiple employees open all afternoon for the kids to split one $5 pie and play free pool all day.  Somehow they made money.  Nobody's parents worried or wondered where we were.  That was a much better country.  Unlike the pizza joints of today, they were quiet as tombs when nobody was feeding the jukebox, still except for the sound of pool being played badly.

      This is so weird; I don't need to ignore him.  It's like now I just start reading a comment, a little synapse closes, %u201Cehh?%u201D, I glance at the avatar, and without even thinking about it, my eyes slide right down past the comment, past the replies, the follow ups, the replies to the follow ups, and only stop when they sound the all-clear cause the avatars change.  I may miss some of you-all's clever replies, but I can't help it.  I love to read, but not that stuff. It%u2019s oil that makes my eyes water.

      yeah word has those 'curley' quotation marks that don't work, so pasting from word is a no-no unless you have those turned off, but accent marks won't work regardless of if you type them or paste them.

      once I did a test post to see if I could post characters with accents and it worked so I did my post only to find out that when you post, the client-side javascript renders your post faithfully, whereas the server-side php program chops it up for everyone else. <br/>

      This is beautiful. I could really see the parlor as Teodor and Ray described it (I've  <em>been</em>  there!) and then when Roast Beef started exposing the dirty and depressing innards, that was true too, and the two visions became one, and it was perfect.

      My feeling on this strip are conflicted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The nostalgia for the 1980's is strong but that nostalgia comes with a side order of paranoia and immpending doom. Like many in the eighties I was convinced that the world would end in a terrible nuclear firestorm. There are a lot of things that encouraged this fear.  <em>Threads</em> ,  <em>Wargames</em> ,  <em>Defcon 4</em>  the Mad Max films,  <em>The Day After</em> , Ronald Reagan, and Raymond Briggs'  <em>When the Wind Blows</em> , but of all these things I blame Sting the most. My status explains why.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember at age 7 asking my mother how old I would be in the year 2000, because that is when I thought the world would end. I remeber thinking 25 was pretty old, I only started to get my shit together in 2000, sometimes I wonder if it was because as a child I thought I had no future. I still get nostalgic for aspects of my childhood, velcro sneakers, Monkey, Totem Tennis etc. However if I dwell on them for too long I remember this horrible fear. So try to teach your kids not to fear. I dunno, play 'em some Blue Oyster Cult or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Octafish end self indulgence now.
