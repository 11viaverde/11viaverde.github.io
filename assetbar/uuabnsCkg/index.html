      This is a good start. The problem yesterday was mainly that it was right there at the top of the comments for all to see. It is very easy to get chubbied or lamed there, especially if it looks even remotely like you posted there just to have your comment easier to see for Those Who Do Not Scroll Down Far. People run out of chubbies and sometimes even lames as they scroll down, and even then, they pay less attention to comments that already do not have any attention paid to them. Sometimes a V-Chub is necessary to get people to start giving you actual chubbies.

      I am trying to imagine the kinds of arguments you were having in that airport. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"What do you mean you don't talk this way? Start talking that way!" <br/>

"How can you say this is England! You're kicking me in the nuts and calling it football!" <br/>

"Your attempts to use game theory to explain the devaluing of the dollar are at best misguided and at worst sophistical!" <br/>

      Also, this will make you a mite jealous Spiny. A couple weeks ago I had to call the BBC to ask them to e-mail some audio from one of their shows to us and I was amused to learn that when ending a phone call, they say "Cheers!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
But that would piss me off if I lived in England and had to deal with people saying a salutation that basically makes me feel like I am supposed to have a demeanor that I do not have every single goddamn day.

      Ohh Spiny, I had absolutely no idea what you meant, but a friend of mine explained it to me. It's because, while in the word "condom" we still emphasise the first syllable, we say the "dom" part like "Tom", whereas you say it like... that language term that I can't remember even though I should because I took English Language A Level... But it means when a vowel in a word is not pronounced as it normally would be but just as a kind of "uh" sound.

      We really emphasize the first syllable, like "CAHNdumb." The two syllables don't rhyme, either. With yours they sort of rhyme and have the same stress, and it always sound pretty funny to me, like you're using received pronunciation about a sleazy "sex item."  <br/>

      You don't pronounce the soft sign per se; rather, it modifies the letter preceding it. It's almost like adding the first half of a "y" sound to the end of the consonant. Think of the way the "n" sounds in "Enya" if you cut off the vowel sound at the end.

      Yeah, I think Ask Jeeves did used to give you snarky answers if you asked certain questions, and it was kind of fun to try to find out which questions would produce them.  I remember once I asked him what the meaning of life was, but instead of a snarky answer I got a very detailed outline of possible explanations of existence, which included links to NASA and the main tenets of most major religions.   <br/>

Jeeves was a good man.

      Well, historically, the key on typewriters was called the "carriage return," because it would  <em>return</em>  the  <em>carriage</em>  that held the paper to the beginning of the line. "Enter" is from the days when computers were made by people who were more comfortable with calculators than typewriters, because they thought of  <em>enter</em> ing a number into the machine. I would say nowadays that "return" makes more sense in the text-entry context, and "enter" in others. Since text entry is most of what most people do with computers, "return" makes more sense these days, I would say. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I still say "enter," but that may just be  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145750/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_%28magazine%29">nostalgia for a misspent youth</a> .

      Like I said, an old-school machine such as the Envaliant III would likely operate on the well-worn principle of the monitor moving to the left with every strike of a key, and then "returning" to the proper position when the end of a line is reached. <br/>

      Are you talking about "chavs"? Chavs have recently come to my attention on the int0r wabs. I'm leaving to study abroad in England in less than a week, and I've been researching them to make sure they aren't hellbats or trained killers. Mainly what I've found out is that they wear fake Burberry clothing, which I do not find particularly threatening.

      Chavs are like, how you say, white trash (although, no offence, British society is less divided along lines of colour than US, so chavs can come in all hues, as can the spluttering middle classes. The discrimination is still freely available with issues of that beautifully complex institution, class). Chavs tend to be poor and working class, and it's easy to judge them because if you've been the victim of some kind of crime (speshly violent), the perpetrator is generally wearing the uniform. Also, gasp, they smoke in front of their babies and spit in public, and they are sartorially lacking, quelle horreur. Obviously, there are other people who dress like that because of fashion and the wonderful kudos associated with a life of crime or poverty in the western world (think hip hop artistes), and reverse snobbery where it's better to be thought of as a chav than a (like anyone uses this word any more) toff. And there are people like me who are forced to nod to the mores of their modes (perhaps a hoody, perhaps correct trainers) to lessen the number of cans thrown at my head as I traverse my neighbourhood. There are people from the same disadvantaged background that others use as an excuse to treat their fellow man like shit, that are perfectly lovely and getting tarred with the same brush, (not I, incidentally. I'm fine) but acknowledgement of this accepts that life is not easy to work out and navigate, and I for one won't have it. Cross the street when you see a baseball cap, and speak only to those whose parents could afford a private education for them, because they must be better people as their Burberry is real. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Uh, yeah, just remember that even Kit Marlowe was stabbed in a pub, and just because our accents are softly comical to you nasal people, doesn't mean you won't get caught in gang crossfire. Depends where you go though. Have a lovely time, It's a great place. My Yankee studying chums are totally jolly hockey sticks.

      Pretty solid definition of a "chav". My opinion is that they're mostly harmless. Of course, some teenage gangs are dangerous - I was just reading today about a father of beaten to death by a gang of drunk teenagers, because he asked them not to smash up his car - but mostly they'll just stand in large groups on the high street or in shopping centres ("malls" to you Yanks), being a slight nuisance and making rude comments to anyone they don't like the look of. Being slightly indie/alternative in my dress sense and having lower-back length red hair, I've received a few comments in my day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I'm mainly talking about teenage chavs, who can really come from all walks of life, not just working class - as barrymorefm said, there's a kind of kudos associated with the look for some. The adult version of a "chav" can be equally abrasive, but they tend not to form large groups and beat up people for the fun of it, so it depends really. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Actually, loneal, it all depends on where you're going, really. I live in the county of Surrey, which is sort of varied. My village is basically chav-free, but one town over is chav-central. If you don't mind, can I ask where you're coming to study?

      It's  <em>long</em>  red hair, as well? Oh, Heccibiggs, you do go on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But yeah, the problem level of chavs is better defined by their attitudes than their numbers. My particular village is avowedly made up of teenage thugs, old people and the polish, but whilst out and about I've at best sustained the wounds of one or two flung insults or askance glances. Then again, I may have paid my dues through education at an assortment of barely below-barbarous public schools. Right now I'm probably just too tall and dress too unremarkably to elicit aggression. <br/>

      I see metal as respectable in its own sense, but in musical terms as a genre it's just an excuse for people to play guitars really hard. <br/>

      You do realize how pathetic you're making yourself look, don't you? I left you alone after our last exchange, but you just needed more attention. It's not that I care about your lames - the 400 chubbies are more than enough to offset them. What bothers me more is that, as unfortunate as it is to believe, behind your avatar and whatever computer you're using to post this there sits a real human being (I use the term loosely) who actually gets off on coming to a messageboard where the vast majority of users come to have a good time and share similar humor, and does so for the purpose of being a cock to strangers instead. This is what everyone who retorts "hey it's only the Internet" forgets. It makes me sad for the future of humanity. I did not know that there were such assholes as you before the Internet existed. Not only that, but the multiple times you've been confronted with the simple fact that the overwhelming amount of lames is a clear indication that your comments are unwanted, you retreat into childish denial a la "Why do you care about lames so much?" At least have the sack to admit that you are a troll who gets off on antagonizing people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize that by responding to you like this I'm just feeding the troll. Go ahead, respond with some glib, dismissive one-liner reveling because you think you've gotten me riled. We'll all be very amused, I'm sure.

      That's just what it's called. "<Name> Village" (sorry if you think I'm being paranoid but I've already told you what county I live in and, well, it really is a very small place). It's in no way big enough to be a town. But it has a church, and I think that's what technically defines it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I've never been to Oxford but it probably won't be major for chavs. However, I can't speak in complete certainty. But high-class university town implies that there will be very few, to me.

      Sure, lots of places are called "village." Doesn't mean that they are, though. Cheltenham, for instance, contains at least two "villages" and has at least one satellite that people call a village, but isn't. <br/> <br/> <br/> In any case, I wouldn't do well stalking you in a village in any county. I imagine turning up at the pub/post office and asking "The Biggs girl - redhair, name that can be abbreviated to 'Hecci' - d'you know her?" to receive the reply "Ah yes, just one moment..." *calls police*. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As to chavs in Oxford, I rather suspect that they have an average complement. It's more likely that students and university affiliates have displaced normal people.

      Chav is a pretty new term to me. In Scotland we call them neds or bams/ bampots, but those words more specifically describe people from housing schemes ('schemies') who have a certain type of anti-social attitude. This is what a ned is like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk0sS4IFGXA

      Naw, I'm pretty sure that "village" means you live in a place where people languidly play flutes and lutes and other -utes instruments all the time, someties wearing overalls and sitting around on rolling green hills under oak trees drinking cider and ale and smoking pipes and stuff.  <br/>

      Oxford's low on the chavs, though they can be found everywhere. In my experience the Oxford ones try too hard. Look out for 14 year olds trying to look threatening in tracksuit bottoms. You doing the uni, Brookes or the Shakespeare Institute? All are institutions of awesome awesome people.

      Last year some goth lass was  <em>kicked in the face until she died</em>  by a couple of charvs, just because she was a goth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Note: I live in the North East, where they're called "charvs" or "charvas". They've been saying it like that since I moved here ten years ago so I'm gonna trust that they're the originators of the phrase. Also, there are more charvs in the North East than you can shake a fake Burberry cap at. I'd move back south if it weren't for the fact that everything apart from them is awesome.

      The accepted origin is the Romany word "charva". It's been in constant usage in the north for a long time in that form. In the south it has taken more forms, and been in and out of use, at least over the course of the last hundred years or so.

      i hate it when people on the internet say that they don't know what something is.  are you trying to make yourself seem cool because you've never heard of a high-falootin' fancy brand?   <br/>

i just typed coach into google and the first site that came up was the official site for "leading American marketer of fine accessories and gifts in leather, suede and signature fabric". <br/> 
 <br/> 
i know this isn't really a big deal, and i'm probably mis-interpreting the situation or whatever, but it's just sort of a pet peeve.   <br/>

on the internet, you can't not know what something is - you can only not want to know what something is.  which now that i think about it, is the most likely scenario, but for some reason that pisses me off just as much.

That's kind of how I saw it. I both lamed and chubbied Asherdan comments based on individual content, not based on who posted them. <br/>

      It was a quiet afternoon in the Bank of Assetbar. Tekende deposited 38 chubbies, earnings from the morning's tradings on the Assetbar Stock Exchange, while Drskradley took out a loan on 20 virtual chubbies ("20 v-chubs and to the letter," he told the bank teller) to buy shares in Retardo posts, which were going very cheap. The bank manager, Zefiel, combed his long Salvador Dali mustache as he sang "Lo lo lo lo lo." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Suddenly the door to the bank burst open, and Asherdan walked in. Zefiel sat up straight in his chair, and gave the security guard a firm glance; the guard knew to keep an eye on this man. Asherdan strode up to the teller window, opened a metal briefcase, and slammed it down in front of the teller. "I'm closing my accounts. Name's Asherdan," he grunted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Zefiel stood up from his desk and approached Asherdan. "May I help you with something, Mister Asherdan?" Zefiel asked cautiously.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Closing my accounts," said Asherdan again. "All my accounts." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The bank teller finished loading the chubbies--all 1891 of them--into Asherdan's briefcase. He slammed the lid of the briefcase shut. "But Mister Asherdan," exclaimed the bank teller, "you have a balance of 2994 lames remaining, to be settled with the Bank of Assetbar!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Asherdan muscled his way past Zefiel and out the door of the Bank of Assetbar, grunting "I'll settle it by closing time today" to the teller. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Zefiel pursued Asherdan as he crossed the busy street outside of the bank. "Asherdan, you have to settle your debts with the Bank of Assetbar! Don't make me call the police!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Watch how it's done," Asherdan advised Zefiel, pushing through the revolving door and into the Assetbar Stock Exchange. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Zefiel waited a minute for the revolving door to stop moving, and then he pushed through. As he walked on to the floor of the stock exchange, Zefiel couldn't spot Asherdan in the mass of men and women on the exchange floor, barking orders at their brokers and agents on their cellphones, and assigning chubbies and lames on their laptops; but within a few moments, Zefiel could see that something was wrong.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The giant LCD screen towering over the floor of the Assetbar Stock Exchange always showed the comments from the most recent strip, as well as the chubby and lame count for each post. Zefiel watched as a post by Falseprophet, awarding a virtual chubby, received one lame, then two, and finally the post disappeared from the stock exchange LCD, as posts with at least 3 lames are hidden by default. Then, another by Rogergs, and one by Blastradius; soon every post on the LCD screen awarding a virtual chubby had gone dead. Secondary screens all around the stock exchange floor confirmed Zefiel's suspicions: posts promising virtual chubbies were going dead all across the board, on every strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The floor sank into a total panic. Men and women screamed into their cellphones and at each other. In the chaos, Zefiel bumped into Cpnglxynchos. "Who did this!" shouted Cpnglxynchos at Zefiel. "It would have taken 1800 chubbies in secret chubby-for-lame bonds to lame away every V-Chub post on Assetbar!" he wailed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"1800 chubbies, did you say?" Zefiel asked, horror spreading across his face as he realized the truth. "I think I know who did this." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I'll kill him!" screamed Cpnglxynchos. "He destroyed the entire V-Chub economy! Who is he?!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
But before Zefiel could get another word out, a crazed man threw a punch, connecting with the side of Cpnglxynchos' head. It was Spectre, a desperate man whose entire fortune had been invested in virtual chubbies, and who had just lost everything. Security guards converged around Spectre, grabbing him and muscling him off of the floor of the stock exchange. <br/> 
 <br/> 
With the V-Chub economy broken, the next dominoes to fall were the chubby-for-chubby bonds. As traders who had invested in chubby-for-chubby bonds realized that their bond partners no longer had enough chubbies to honor their chubby-for-chubby bonds, they withdrew from the bonds, laming their former bond partners in the process. The furor and panic on the exchange floor reached a deafening height as post after post received 3 lames and disappeared from the main LCD board over the exchange floor. The security guards were overwhelmed in the chaos, and police rushed into the fray to break up the beginnings of a riot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Zefiel stood on the edge of the exchange floor, watching it all go down. Suddenly an uneasy, heavy silence settled in over the exchange floor: the main LCD board, showing all posts made on the current strip, was blank. Every secondary board around the exchange floor, showing posts made on strips in the last two weeks, had also gone blank. All posts had been lamed into oblivion. The entire economy had collapsed. Assetbar was gone. It was over.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then Zefiel spotted him: one man, leaving the exchange floor, carrying a metal briefcase. Zefiel chased after him, and caught up to him in the street. "Asherdan!"  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Asherdan turned around, a faint smile on his face. Zefiel saw that his own bank, the Bank of Assetbar, was now closed; the lights were out and a sign was posted on the front door reading "Closed due to insolvency." Zefiel knew then that Asherdan had won, he had finally won; and Zefiel had nothing more to say.

      It's like Ferris Bueller, cpnglxynchos.  You are complaining about having a piece of shit car, but heccibiggs has to envy your piece of shit because she has no car. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But watch out, heccibiggs.  I got mentioned once, and then I had to puzzle out whether it was good or bad to be that guy in that movie.  And how the fuck did they know I looked like that actor, anyway? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, fuck chubbies, man.  The new currency in this place is how many times your name gets dropped in fan-fiction.  The sleazier the fan-fiction, the better, which means you want to be mentioned by Dr. Manflesh.  The good thing about Dr. Manflesh is that you can't suck up to him.  Friend, enemy, it doesn't matter.  Man walks his own line.

      Spinynorman hasn't been commenting for that long but he has racked up an ungodly amount of chubbies in that time. Most likely because his comments always add something to the conversation and don't seem to exist solely to be chubby-magnets. He has a good mix of humor and lack of pretension. He also cleans up nice and looks  <em>fabulous</em>  in a backless evening gown.

      Well, it doesn't. Perhaps a misunderstanding on Onstad's part? Whatever, if you think about the word and the connotations you got when you first read "punter", it's appropriate, right? I mean, you probably just thought it sounded like an odd British word similar to "bloke", or whatever. My guess is that's what Onstad was going for. <br/>

      Nah, I'm with Biggs on this one. "That'll keep the punters happy," as said by a rancorous shop-owner (Posibly asian) seems to gel, but "He's a light-fingered little punter," to describe a disrespected chimney-sweep wouldn't work. <br/>

It's a customer, but a slightly derogatory term and not one that a business-owner or service-provider would use to pertain to one of his patrons in person.

      First of all, Scottish Gaelic is not the same as Scots. Second of all, Scots has for various reasons both retained older forms of what we now call English, and has also been repeatedly influenced by other far-northern-european tongues, because those countries have historically traded with each other a lot (For instance Goteborg was built with the intention that it would be occupied by traders from, among other countries, Scotland).

      Seriously though, the point is that, first of all, the OED is not good at regionality, and second of all that Geordie is close to Danish, what with having spent several hundred years as part of the Kingdom of Denmark. King Cnut was King of Denmark.

      This is kind of a tricky question.  If Connie says typically Connie things, then he's a one-dimensional caricature of himself.  But if Onstad gives Connie some non-typical dialogue, a lot of readers go "What? Where did that come from? Connie doesn't act like this!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think in the end we need to trust Onstad at least a little bit and see where things go.  Maybe Cornelius is getting stuck in a rut, and some of the other characters are going to be forced to break him out of it?  We saw something similar with Lyle and his bathroom training (although that never saw resolution).   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess what I'm trying to say here is yes, Cornelius does seem rather one-dimensional lately, but maybe it's not just lazy writing.  Let's wait and see.  Together!

      I disagree with you. This is not a typical thing for Connie to say. He generally uses forms of speech that are associated with older, cosmopolitan americans who cultivate such an image. He never uses English slang, because his back story is that he is American.

      I think the underlying reason, at least one I just realized, is that pretty much every character except Cornelius has been at or near the center of a story arc. But come on, you can't expect an old man to be taking road trips across the country or engaging in a 3000 man brawl. If there was a story arc focused on Cornelius, half the strips would probably take place in the bathroom.

      I just wanted to say (entirely off topic) that the other day I sat in front of the computer, poured a full James Squire Amber Ale into my Dude and Catastrophe Glass and scrolled through Acheworld. It was a simple joy. One you all need to experience.

      Booze is always on topic.  Give us the tasting notes on the beer! <br/>

I want to say, to whoever it was from Plymouth who suggested Plymouth gin, that is an interesting drink.  A bit sweeter than my usual, I think it will serve nicely in gin and tonics and I will be drinking it thusly next time I have some tonic.

      In a blind test, our beer tasters came to the following conclusions:  <br/> 
Appearance: Lovely toffee brown colour.  <br/> 
Aroma/Bouquet: High intensity, floral, herbal, fruity.  <br/> 
Taste: Full-bodied, smooth and creamy taste, slight hint of toffee. Good carbonation.  <br/> 
Summary: Recommended!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I aggree with the above. I don't like a straight up beer beer. Something interesting.
