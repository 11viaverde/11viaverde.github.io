      I remember this one time when I was at a strip club and one of the rather nudish lady in question began telling me about her boyfriend. This doesn't exactly lend itself well to commerce in such an establishment to begin with, but then she began regaling me about how her boyfriend was a member of the "White Pride" movement, which, she assured me, was  <em>totally</em>  different from the "White Power" movement. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Needless to say, my sense of shame, which had already been at a steady "nagging" level, quickly shifted into fourth gear and into the "crippling" degree.

      I'm not the storyteller that Norman is, but if y'all will indulge me, I have a 'crippling degree of shame' strip club story also.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had just started a new job in a new city, and one of my co-workers invited me to join them for some strip club tomfoolery after work on Friday.  I was nervous, because the co-worker was a tad shady, but I agreed.  Now, I have travelled extensively and seen many a strip club in my day, and let me assure you that this was the worst I had ever seen.  It was little more than 4 doublewides stuck together with the walls knocked out.  The bar area had linolium flooring.  Needless to say, I made eye contact with no one and tried to hide in a corner. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Up walks..well a middle age stripper.  I think most will know what I mean and see such as stretch marks and sagging.  I'm already shamed, because I can see I'm already being rude with my facial expression.  Then she cries out and hugs my co-worker.  They grew up together.  He knows her real name.  They catch up.  She then comes back with...pictures of her kids.  I've had enough, but I'm trying to make a graceful exit.  It fails because someone buys me a beer, and now I have to sit here until I finish it.  Finally she gets called to the stage, and my co-worker turns to me with a proud glow on his face and says "I've tapped that 4 times!"  Grace be damned, I finished the beer in one shot and walked out the door without a word.  The next morning I started looking for another job.

      i think this would be relative to amount of times you pumped the air rifle. the world's first air rifle was created by a Dutch strongman named Ewout Fabian Hogarth. legend has it that he pumped the rifle just over fourteen thousand times. when the trigger was pulled the air rifle kicked back into his bozack crushing it flat against his grundle. the BB was never found.

      Interestingly, I have been to quite a few gun shows (yes, yes, I'm a redneck American; git 'r done and such) and never once received a titty twister. Nor have I given one; it just seems like a bad idea to tweak a man's nipples without his permission inside of a convention center full of guns.
