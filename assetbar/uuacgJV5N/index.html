      i'm amused mostly by the fact that the eye is terrified, and STARING at you, glancing about or blinking.  it's just staring in total fear, wondering if maybe the chip you just picked up was too dry and you need to go back for more. <br/> 
 <br/> 
that is the worst potential moment of that eye's existence. <br/> 
 <br/> 
also, is there a person attached to the eye, or is it just an eye?  i would think that if there were a person, it would try to get away (or it would try not to have been found buried under a pile of nachos anyway [i also think that you would have to be eating a lot of dang nachos in order not to see the person underneath]).  probably it is a disembodied eye, which makes me wonder why it's terrified. <br/> 
 <br/> 
aren't big old eyes usually the ones doing the terrifying?  but then, i guess he is, since it's one of beef's nightmares.  so they both are. <br/> 
 <br/> 
like crossing paths with a puma i guess.  don't stab the eye with the chip, and the eye won't steal your soul.  come on beef, evading tragedy is as simple as that.

      There was a terrified eye coming out of a boil on a guy's hand in the opening to the Goosebumps(tm) series, all looking around frantically.

      Goosebumps ran to a pretty strict template. Each 'chapter' lasted about three pages, and at the end of at least twenty of these chapters, something apparently terrifying would happen. Then, at the beginning of the next chapter (i.e. right on the opposite page), it would be revealed that the terrifying thing was something totally normal, like the narrator's friend in a scary mask. This would continue until around chapter 50, where the terrifying thing would be real. I remember thinking as a kid that it was a bit... obvious. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, there was one where the kid's family pulled their faces off and revealed they were monsters, and then the monsters pulled  <em>their</em>  faces off and revealed they were actually humans, and so on back and forth for like seven chapters until you started to speculate about how freakishly large the original latex heads must have been. Unless I'm just hallucinating now. I liked Redwall, anyway.

      Redwall was awesome when you were a kid, but seen through the eye of an adult it has some pretty dodgy undertones about racism and also eating way too much dessert.
