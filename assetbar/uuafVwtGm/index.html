      I disagree with all of the above. <br/> 
We're conceived as the expression of self-perpetuation... a futile battle against entropy that we spend our entire lives and deaths losing until we eventually succumb completely. Maturity is a delusion that we cling to for self-reassurance. Psychological masturbation. The fragments of desire for persistance and perpetuity hard-wired into our brains crying in pain and pointless opposition to our unbecoming. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For we are to be as we are meant to be, which is to say that we shall not  <em>be</em>  at all.  <br/> 
Degeneration, decay, rot... These are the things such as bliss is made of, until finally all troubles are gone and peace is once again all.  <br/> <br/> <br/> <em>{Subtext : Fuck maturity. Live fast. Die young. Scream like a brat the whole way. More fun like that.}</em>

      Maximus, that's basically the definition of how any science works, not just science in the U.S.  If something is not scientific, that is to say, if it violates scientific protocol, then you could say that it 'offends' the scientific process.  Yes, there are those of us who would like to pound down the rusty nails of non-scientific reasoning.  It's all well and good to believe in Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, God, and other delusions, but are any of these paranormal phenomena gonna fix your car when it breaks down, or fix the world economy when it breaks down?  While there are certainly those of us (for instance, BushCO) who are quite eager to trust our future to the hands of God, or Fate, or Whatever, there are also those of us who suspect that perhaps, just maybe, the Powers That Be may dictate that our fate is in our own hands, and that the test of fate is... (ta da!!...)  our ability to follow a line of methodical and rational reasoning (AKA science.)  This mentality that concludes that scientific inquiry is somehow a disingenous ruse hell bent on robbing humanity of it's Ultimate Fate, is, sadly, correct except for the minor point which it misunderstands, namely, the point of just what that Ultimate Fate is bound to be, without science...  Of course, the Fairies and Unicorns and Angels and such will guide us to our just Ultimate Fate... well... that's nice and all, and it would be super nice if those who persist in such a belief could go away, far away, maybe take over their own state and secede from the Union... a nice midwestern state...  Or perhaps Alaska...   <br/>

      I'm with you on this one, but I think more than just hang-ups we're all screwed by nature. It is the nature of man to be fucked completely. Part of this I think was observed best by Hobbes. We are competitive and selfish by nature, but society teaches us this isn't good and maturity teaches us to lie in order to be accepted. Sometimes we even lie to ourselves because we don't want to confront that nature. This creates friction between what we know we really want and how much of a dick people will think we are if we go for it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In a way Pat summarizes this pretty well. He wants to be a wild man living out his deepest desires, but he can't. He has hang-ups and he has actual feelings about the world. Since he can't reconcile these he becomes a completely insufferable bastard about trying to show how much he cares, how superior he's being, how much more goddamn  <em>conscious</em>  he is. It's because he can't just be himself and is consumed by rage at society for refusing to let him be free. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, he's just a total prick.

      I would say that not only can we not overcome it, but that I do not necessarily think we should. We should, however, acknowledge it. As I said earlier maturity is often, though not exclusively, the process of learning to lie. Children are violent, venal, and pure. They are horrible, hate-filled little monsters that act based on their feelings and impulses and this lends this the capacity for tremendous cruelty. Growing up teaches you to mask that. It also teaches you the important skill of knowing how much of a complete fucking idiot you were almost every goddamn moment of the day when you were younger. Even up until last month. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for Pat I wanted to try and go all psychobabble on him. Trying to explain his problems and make him a sympathetic figure to be pitied. It was facetious, however, that's what the last line was for. Despite all the nonsense I just went on about I acknowledge that he's really just a prick.

      And yet this is an approach that leads to acceptance of traits and behaviours that ought to be unacceptable. The Circumstances I am from gave me two parents who, in vastly different ways, simply accepted what they considered to be their nature and they didn't seek to improve themselves beyond those self-imposed limits.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It seems like a particularly sad world view that says that you are just a dick and all attempts to change that on a meaningful level are doomed to failure, that the best anybody can accomplish in pursuit of a moral life is a particularly fine web of lies and deception.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Worse, I think, is that it seems to raise a prickly question. If we are unable to change ourselves then by what grounds to we judge others? They're equally as without power in the whole scenario as we are. I suppose if you're willing to just swallow that we have no right, no moral authority but we can and should do it anyway because it is within our collective power then it's not inconsistent. It just seems very sad to me. Might makes right writ through the very nature of morality.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But it's said that I'm an unusually optimistic pessimist.

      do we have to? i mean, really? is it a reasonable goal to overcome one's "nature?" it seems to me that that kind of thinking is what leads one to engage in such as self-flagellation or genocide. i suspect learning to accept such nature seems the healthier alternative. having said that, i am in awe of marcus aurelius' professions of absolute indifference towards his physical maladies.

      It is probably the best song from his solo career. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Frankly there is so many means laden in my use of "the hook" there that even I haven't yet worked them (reference to the song, no longer in trouble with said pirates, no longer a pirate myself, etc.) all out. Just a moment of "dear god, what in the hell did I do by phrasing it like that?"  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps I'm just reading too much into it though... I have been reading  <em>House of Leaves</em>  a bit too much lately.

      It is a bit hokey, and, sadly, it's still one of the better ones off of that album, I think.  Most of that album could be described as hokey, which is, overall, a bad thing.  Some of the hokey songs are my favorites, but overall, man, that is a disappointing album.

      Yeah, I agree, let's avoid too much digression, but I really don't like that album much at all.  I even sat here listening to it again (skipping songs I hate; e.g. Black Book, Discretion Grove, etc.), since I hadn't brought it out in years.  I've also never been a big fan of some of the "favorites" off of the album: Jenny & the Ess-Dog (this one stirs up a lot of bile in me, surprisingly, and I'll just leave it at that) and Church on White.  When it comes to the latter, I've always felt like it appears to be a good song, but I've ultimately always found it very bland.  The Silver Jews' "Death of an Heir of Sorrows," which you could pretty much call a sister song (they were both written in response to the death of Rob Bingham, SM and Berman's old college friend), is, to me, a much better tribute and song overall.  It's probably my favorite Joos song, but, yeah, I know it sounds extremely petty to compare tributes to a dead friend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Truthfully, the only album I actually like is the 2nd one, and even that one is just a bit above "decent."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh DAMMIT I just went and nearly did a song by song breakdown.

      Not being a dick about terms like "unless", you understand, but if you've fixed your own ass to a self-actualized "place", or however you want to describe it, that guy killing you won't make any difference to you....if the guy even follows through. Odds are, he won't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 What I'm getting at is if he kills you, it's because it really is your time, not a random, senseless thing. And being self-actualized, or whatever term you'd wish, you're totally cool with that. <br/>

      You are making the assumption that I am not self-actualized, which there's nothing I can do about. <br/>

Yes, I understand that one's response to someone wanting to murder one does not have to be to preemptively murder him, but it's funnier that way.  So I should have just said that from the beginning and saved us all some time.  Semi-seriousness always burns me.

      This is how McDonalds employs people. Like a rancher at a Home Depot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ronald drives a truck to the chain gang, says to the guard, "I need three men that are good with their hands. Good with a fryer." and the deputy picks out those men. <br/>

      Thank you for clearing this up for me. I never understood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, for my first job I was like: "ok, I just won't work at McDonalds" and I got a job serving at a pizza place, which eventually turned into delivery driving over the course of two days. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, delivery driving is a fucking sweet job if you are in school. I worked 4 hours a day maximum, got paid 6.50 an hour plus a dollar for every delivery (which is way more than the cost of gas) and then there were tips. It averaged out to be like 17 bucks an hour.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the best part was that I didn't have to BE THERE. They would call me if a delivery came in, so on slow days I would just clock in, leave, get high with my friends and would occasionally just go "oh, gotta do a delivery". I would drive back, deliver the pizza (sometimes just bringing my friends with me), and then go back to just hanging out. Some days there would be no deliveries, and I would just not be there. I would get paid 6.50 an hour to play Super Smash Brothers or ping pong.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Why would anyone go for McDonalds instead of something like that? I mean, even if you don't have a car you could wait tables (and don't say you need experience. Chilis will hire armless-bipolar lunatics with a penchant for nibbling ears, so long as they have a fauxhawk). Thats way more money than McD's. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is no reason to work for McDonalds.

      actually daidai it all depends on the MCD or the pizza place.  Some let you get high on the job, some frown on that.  Unfortunately, with corporate America getting all CRAAAAZY like it has been these past few years, it's pretty much snuffed out most of the humanity in most work places, even the ones that pay minimum wage.  Shit, I should start a pizza franchise and employ only stoners....  Stoners would have a real personality, instead of this corporate-ass mind control bullshit that is forced on so many employees.  I am sure a lot of customers would appreciate getting a pizza from a place with humanity in this day and age.  The pizza box could come with pictures of the likes of Bernie Ebbers and Bernie Madoff.  When you are done with your pizza you could then burn the corporate CEO's in effigy.  Just pop it in your oven on broil for 10 minutes should do the trick.

      I can't speak for getting high and they sure as fuck don't deliver, but I know of at least one pizza place (not really a chain, but they've got two locations) where they are firmly committed to being metal. Not in the bullshit sort of trying to hard way either. Just the normal "working pizza and blasting Slayer" methodology. If I go in there to grab a slice one day and the guy heating my slice does not have long hair and a strong opinion on Dio-era Sabbath then we can begin to worry.

      I always thought the wear and tear on your car ended up making it a bit of a losing proposition. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, you bring up a solid point. Delivery drivers can sometimes act like total dicks for not getting tipped as well as they want. Unlike waitstaff, however, they are required to get paid an actual wage (AFAIK, I've had friends do delivery for a number of places and never heard of anyone getting below minimum... most getting a bit over that).

      This is similar to my experience, except we didn't get paid hourly at all, only for deliveries. The price per delivery was high though, so on a busy night you could make a killing. I averaged around the same as you, it sounds like. If I worked Fridays, it was pretty easy to hit $30-50/hr, but I also kind of hated working Fridays.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also worked at McDonald's. What McD's has on a pizza place is the 100 other people that are stuck there with you. Hilarity often ensues, and you make some good friends. I have some great memories of McD's. That was as a 16-yr old boy though; I wouldn't go back now even the people I work with at my current job are not nearly as fun. You grow out of it, but while it lasts it is equal parts shameful and fun. Maybe it's not better than other places, but it's not so bad if you get in with good people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have McD's to thank for teaching me that it doesn't matter how shitty something is, it is so much better when you have some rad dudes and ladies to share it with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have Pizza Hut to thank for being the perfect job for my lazy ass in my senior year of high school, and for allowing me to get my money's worth tenfold out of all my CDs at the time.

      I'm not feeling it. It seems like he intended this to be a bigger, longer sort of thing, but he got a few strips into it and then quickly brought it to an end with this strip after realizing he doesn't really have anywhere to go with it. He's telling us, not showing us. We don't see their relationship, how it comes together, how it falls apart, how Lyle learns that a woman is not a '72 AMC Hornet. It feels very aborted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not to mention how we never get to meet Gator or hear about the opening of the cabinet shop or anything. Sounds like he just spends the rest of his days working at McDonald's. He sure as hell doesn't seem broken-up by her enough to refuse to talk about it let alone wear a hat for her. Maybe the telling helped him to work things out, but that is not what I'm getting. <br/>

      allright well today's strip is so much like a Tom Waits song that it's starting to bother me.  The problem is that unlike a Tom Waits song, I just don't feel any connection at all to the characters.  Not to Lyle then, not to him now.  Onstad is telling a story, but he's telling it in generalities.  What I mean is that it would be better if instead of saying 'she was jealous' he would simply recount a sequence of odd and endearing and entertaining and sad and morose and melancholic events which demonstrate that she was jealous, without having to come out and say it like some burly dude's voice doing a C grade Russian language narration of a bootleg-via-camcorder of Titanic.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Specifically, I am in the mood for a nice abstract and surreal strip that involves maybe space aliens or Air Wolf or something just crazy and improbable, because shit, by now, nothing Lyle says anymore in this arc can be improbable, you know what I mean? <br/>

      Definitely. If instead of say, giving a ton of money to people who fucked things up in the first place why not give a ton of money to science and the arts? Y'know, stuff that will actually benefit society rather than line the pockets of some wealthy asshat. Give people who historically have little money a chance to be on top and spend it wisely while making the world a better place. <br/>

      For the previous strip I suggested a possible direction for this arc, involving a trip to Gainesville.  In one terrifyingly crystallizing moment today I saw the entire progression of that arc: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lyle's back-story continues to revolve around Darlene, whom he has been stuck on since early times (https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uuaF7qzWT).  Lyle and Teodor continue to Gainesville to check on Teodor's new inheritance, and Lyle wanders his old stamping grounds.  Things have changed: the McDonald's is now a Starbucks, the pavilion where they saw Priest is doing some Jonas Brothers knockoff, even the gin joints are less sweaty and puke-stained. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Eventually, he meets Darlene.  Her hair's cut, she's a little more plump, she's in a sensible job with a husband and 2 kids (kind of like Jenny from Forrest Gump).  She's outgrown her wild ways, and Lyle has not.  They exchange pleasantries, but they both know that the past is truly behind them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lyle and Teodor return to Achewood.  Ray sends the invite for Bourbon Chicken and crispy Stellas.  Lyle laments his loss, then washes back the final pangs of regret in a deluge of Kentucky's finest.  Teodor sells the inheritance property to Ray, who uses it for a "back-to-roots" marketing plan for his record label.  The status quo returns to Achewood, not with a bang but with a whimper. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>fin.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
All this slammed into my head in the middle of a cheeseburger.  Lunch was extra freakish for me today.

      i finally had a true-to-goodness double-quarter pounder the other night. <br/>

all the other times, the mexican or lazy high-schooler entering my order was either never told i ordered a double, or they didn't know how to enter it in, or care. <br/>

it was a heavy-duty sandwich! <br/>

i'll stick with the Big Mac when i visit Mickey D's from now on. <br/>

if you don't get it two times, and three times is the charm, sometimes, you'll wish you'd stopped at two.

      Simple observation hour: Lyle has previously written very well, but has been assumedly sober (i.e. not holding a bottle). I'm guessing the main reason Teodor gets to ghostwrite is that there is no way Lyle is going to be able to remain sober or without contact with some sort of brown liquid for this particular story.
