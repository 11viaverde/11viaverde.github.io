      It is not necessary to ask  <em>why</em>  or  <em>how.</em>  It is like having a dream where you know you are dreaming but are willing to see where this thing is going, at peace with things you know have only dream-logic.

      Embrace the surreal, dude. Embrace it. It doesn't have to be obvious humour all the time. I didn't like it at first either, but reread the arc - these are probably some of the most subtle strips in the archive, if a legged, walking, helicopter controlled by two cats can be classed as subtle.

      I don't have caps-lock issues, dude. Its no louder than anyone else. <br/>

But yeah... I'm a stubborn guy, and my views are unpopular. Still stands though that "professional photography" is more about having the equipment and proximal target than any actual skill or effort. Just riles a guy that a person who goes out somewhere and clicks a button can be thought of in the same league as guys who have struggled over weeks to paint a thing.   <br/> 
That there is not justice.

      Even Pat would think you're a douchebag, frankly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Good photography is a tremendously difficult combination of technical skill and artistic ability.  A well-shot journalistic photograph has the credibility and emotive power to change the course of human history.  Fine art photography involves stylistically restructuring reality; being forced to choose themes and symbols based on real-world existence represents a profound artistic challenge.  Digital photographers working in Photoshop use digital paintbrush tools and potentially hundreds of layers to create a finished product, often spending as much or more time and effort on it than a painter on a canvas.  Meanwhile, there is prodigious subtlety and artistic skill involved with processing a print in a darkroom, particularly if working with multiple exposures per sheet.  AFAIK, only printmaking requires more technical expertise, although working in a darkroom often requires a sophisticated sense of timing that printmaking does not.  Just because someone CAN pick up a cheap camera and click the shutter button doesn't mean that they're a photographer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The fact that you think that professional photography is somehow simplistic doesn't surprise me, though.  From what I've seen of you on this board, you seem like an ignorant, bigoted twat...sort of like what Asherdan might be like if he talked about anything other than Onstad.  Fie on you, sir, fie.

      That's what I was going to say, but you got to it two months earlier and with a great deal of eloquence. Anyone who thinks photography is simple would do well to deal with an actual camera, with F-stops and ISO and a light meter, and then try developing it in a darkroom, preferably with some burning or dodging, before speaking and showing their ignorance.

      I cleaned out my darkroom locker at school today, and I ran across my first darkroom print.  120 film on a $20 all-plastic (plastic lens!) Holga camera.  I sandwiched two negatives in the enlarger so that my silhouette would be standing on some tree branches.  I defy the assholes of the e-world to tell me that's not a pretty complicated first project.

      Dude... that is unjustifiable pretention and you know it. There is no quantifiable difference between a "good photo" and a "bad photo" any more than there is between a "good painting" and a "bad painting"... And these days all sorts of paintings get hung up in galleries and raved about.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And no matter what you're aiming for... once you've got the right equipment for the task and are actually in the place where you've got your thing you want a picture of. ALL it eventually comes down to is the click of a button.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Photoshopping, naming quirks aside, is a different matter altogether... not that most of that is especially difficult from my perspective either, though some folks can do some right fancy stuff with it that I couldn't even wrap my head around. But still... different ball-game. That is graphical editing and not the photography of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But basically... you're defending an indefensible point, and being ridiculously pretentious about it.  <br/>

      soticoto I don't think anything you said there was the slightest bit true. Your comment about photoshopping, especially, makes me suspect you know very little about it at all. <br/>

"once you've got the right equipment for the task" - Uh, what equipment is that, exactly? You need some expertise to make that choice. Are you going to use a telescopic lens zoomed in close, or just get up close to it? Is 18mm enough of a wide angle for the effect you're after? <br/> 
 <br/> 
"and are actually in the place where you've got your thing you want a picture of." - same argument. What place is that, exactly? And what thing? Is your subject going right in the centre? If it's a landscape, how much sky do you want to include? What do the clouds look like? If it's a macro shot, where do you want your focal plane? Are you putting anything near your thing for reference?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Are you even likely to get a chance at your "thing", if you're not a professional photographer who carries their camera everywhere, trading off the time and effort of that for the rewards of the - yes, the JOB (as in, the profession)? Is your thing in Namibia? Is it underwater? Is it in a French cave? <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Photoshopping ... That is graphical editing and not the photography of it." - only if you think "Photoshopping" means putting a penis on the moon, or making Scarlett Johannsen look like she's topless when she's not. In those examples, you are changing the information content of the digital image. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In point of fact, much of what photographers do with Photoshop et al involves changing the way the information that IS present is presented. This IS "the photography of it", as surely as it is when they used to take a picture on film and prepare it in various different ways for different effects. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The most basic way is to make shadows brighter, or bright areas darker, revealing information that is genuinely within the image (i.e. not changing or obscuring anything), but making it into a more realistic image, i.e. one that resembles what the human eye would actually see - something a camera cannot do by clicking the button. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But maybe you want to obscure information rather than reveal it. Or maybe you want to alter the colour balance or the hue, revealing things both literally (i.e. things you couldnt see in the raw image, but are there) and artistically (i.e. aesthetically). <br/> 
 <br/> 
A professional photographer, of course, would be able to list many more things than this. Not being a professional photographer, I can only relate some of the most basic things which photographer friends of mine have taken the time to explain to me (and it does take explaining). <br/> 
 <br/> 
And a professional photographer knows how to use all of these elements, from the choice of equipment, the settings on the equipment, the positioning and focus of the initial photo, the time of day, the kind of illumination you set up (all that stuff that you have to do before you click the button), to the ways you can modify an image - and the different effects that different modifications will lead to, both aesthetic and informational. All of these things require choices by a human being with a body of knowledge stored in their brain that well-deserves the label of "professional". <br/> 
 <br/> 
And finally, from the perspective of someone doing research - because scientific research is the context in which i encounter my photographers - photography is a tool for collecting and storing and explaining information. If i hadn't worked with professional photographers - who use an expert set of knowledge and are paid for that - i would have missed countless details that are relevant to my work. Worse, i wouldn't have even been aware of some of the things that are possible for furthering the work i do - because that requires an expert's knowledge of this particular tool.

      #1. Right equipment. So far as I can tell, expensive stuff will generally result in clearer, higher resolution image. But even THAT isn't necessary. Heck, a low resolution image can sometimes have aesthetic qualities that high-resolution stuff lacks... if you're into that sorta thing. Either way though, photography is essentially machine-made, or even simply chemically made if you prefer. It is a direct capturing of the image of what is in front of it in a rather scientifically precise manner, which is quite a boulder's throw from anything reasonably called "art". Nothing about it is open to interpretation any more than the physical subject of the photo itself is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#2. Anything you want, anywhere you can find it. If you like photos of Buddha statues, then you photograph Buddha statues. If you like photos of penguins, then you photograph penguins. If you like photos of dogshit then you photograph dogshit. As long as you know where to find what YOU wanna photo, then you can go and photo it, but if you go taking a photo of something I don't like, I'm probably gonna call it a shit photo... simply cos the subject matter is shit. That is all it really comes down to. <br/> 
In any case, actually having the ability to get there and photograph it has fuck all to do with art.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
#3. Photoshopping. Graphical editing if you prefer. Irrespective, it isn't photography. You don't need to do any such thing to get a photographic image, no more than the moon only becomes so when a penis is added to it. We're talking about a tool that can change images... any images, pretty much. I've done plenty of it myself, and not of the petty kind either (I've mostly done texturing for game-mods). Photography though, it isn't. <br/> <br/> <br/> In any case... You don't have to believe anything I say is "true". Matters of definition as I see them can quite often be quite fluid, but then in this case I have quite clearly justified my position. As such, your take on it makes not a mote of difference to myself. Furthermore, for someone claiming to be doing scientific research, you seem rather averse to addressing this matter in a logical way (that is to say in your questioning the "truth" of my words, you didn't actually address your concerns directly but instead resorted to rhetoric). Take that as you will.

      The Mexican connection is made obvious with the Lucha Libre mask, not to mention the recent references to products enhanced with Mexican magical realism. <br/>

The actual magical realism part of the helicopter experience escaped me at first. Now, I'm starting to think that the long legs might be something to do with the feeling of wearing seven-league boots while flying across the countryside in a helicopter.  <br/>

Or is that the reverse of the effect of recent magical realist products?

      That is not the point at play here. The point is that for all the "wonderful art" people here praise in this arc, a lot of it is just Onstad superimposing blurry drawings over photographs he  <em>most likely </em> did not take.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, this isn't to say I don't enjoy this arc. I do. Not my favorite, but it's a nice little experiment. But Caduceo has a good point in his first sentence. Many strips in this leg of the arc  <em>are</em>  artistically lazy, and it's foolish to pretend otherwise. Blurring a small vectored luchador head with stick legs and badly expressed perspective does not an Aivazovsky painting make.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Again. I like the arc. But it's not nice to be a cock to a stranger.
