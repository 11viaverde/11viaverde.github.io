      What is newsworthy is Philippe's nonchalant reaction of "I had to rewind a little". Newsworthy in that it's funny. Meaning that I'm glad Onstad put in... errr... etc.

      Philippe and I are alike in our willingness to be abused by Asian women. The difference is that all he has to do is make conversation, whereas I have to arrange for a room at distant motel and provide the woman in question with a variety of elaborate and expensive "gifts" which may readily be exchanged for cash money at certain businesses. In this, Achewood is both like life, and unalike. Interesting.

      I'd call 'em square.  Whitey's is all over the upper & central midwest, from MN down to MO and TN, and with a delicate tendril extending northeast to OH and NY.  Also, having though this hard about it, the chances of me eating White Castle today are now at 95 percent.

      I like that Philippe wants to be on record as coming out against shooting a hippo. Looking like you're soft on shooting hippos is exactly the kind of thing that could derail a presidential bid if it were discovered.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is like having Todd for a running mate, except with less cocaine and more adverts with a slow flyover view of the African savanna and a pleading voice telling us we could lose this treasure forever unless we act now and also give them just a little money.

      Sorry, Philippe! When my old English teacher was on holiday in North Africa, his guide had to shoot a hippo that was attacking them. It is one of his favourite stories, after the one where he met Jim Broadbent and the one where he set his hands and head on fire by accident.

      Your teacher sounds wonderful.  Man, I kinda miss high school.  None of my college profs have yet to come even close to being as cool as some of my high school teachers.

      Due to the fact that we share this experience, I am going to posit that this is a universal phenomenon. <br/>

      I like that even though Philippe's making less effort to be relevant in this one, his writing is getting pretty polished. I could probably recognize his voice if I saw him on the Tribune or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, if this is his journalistic product at age 5, what about the hypothetical situation where he gets older?
