      It makes sense for Roast Beef to feel threatened/enticed by a prostitute from India because that is where his IT job could end up someday. Instead of bangin a website he'd be bangin the sister of the dude who created a website that he should've created and I'd imagine that to be hella satisfying.

      As far as I can tell: there was going to be a Roast Beef prostitute strip similar to the Ray one, but the Achewood machine malfunctioned, so Beef just looks around aimlessly and whatever small animal he was supposed to bang is horribly deformed. The person who operates the Achewood machine decides to blame the error on poor Indian manufacturing. <br/>

      I got there myself, re-reading the strip. It is helpful to see that you found your way to the same place. I think this is one of those meta-strips where Onstad metaphorically exposes the mentla process of creating an Achewood strip.

      That's actually the most coherent thing i've heard thus far. Just look that thing.. it looks like some teleporter fucked up big time. Spiny is on point too, with this strip being one in a series of Rorschach ink blot tests. If so, i'm not anticipating Téodor's turn. Dude has issues.

      Yeah, I think the Achewood machine is on the fritz and is pulling stock characteristics of both characters and horribly jumbling them with complete insanity. <br/>

It doesn't help that the "Ache" on the machine looks a lot like "Acme." That threw me for a bit.

      Man, what would Nice Pete's look like.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it would just be him sitting on a wooden stool in a cinderblock room holding a stick over an oil can fire, dangling a spider over the greedy flames from the end of the branch and watching its legs collapse like broken fingers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then he hears a voice say, "Pete? Pete? I'm a prostitute." <br/> 
 <br/> 
He looks up and the moon's out the window, crossing the old broken fence making its shattered segments look like the spine of some ancient decayed creature lying askew in the weedy fields. It comes and stands beneath the tree and says, "Womanflesh. Bitchflesh." <br/> 
 <br/> 
And Pete tosses the stick in the fire and walks to the door and he looks at the moon and he sees a face in it, swollen and dumb and luminescent, and Pete says, "I bet you smell like honey. I bet you smell like honey, sweet and fragrant." <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the moon says, "Waters deeps. Waterings it deepenings. Down to where tree-limbs dig down and eaterings things all dead inside." <br/> 
 <br/> 
And Pete says, "I'm going to water it. I got to water it. I'm gonna."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then the gray rain starts.

BTW, your reply from like four weeks ago (where you posted the image) seemed to indicate that you did not recognize the man in the image.  He is Bill Hicks, and if you have never listened to his comedy you  <em>really</em>  should.  Then again, he died in 1994, so maybe you're familiar and just never saw a photo.  Just gotta make sure.

      Interesting interpretation.  However, I don't think of Ray as the sort of dude that is often shamed at all.  Ray's shame on Friday was singular in that respect.  Maybe Onstad is simply telling us that the hiring of a prostitute is a transaction fraught with opportunities for self-reflection.  For some such as Ray, an opportunity for self-reflection is not an opportunity that should be passed, but usually is.  Your interpretation of Beef's interaction today is spot-on.

      You're right. There is so little sex of any kind in that story. It's fantastically devoid of sexings. So much for being high epic fantasy, amirite? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pullman I think has talked about how the LotR trilogy (along with Narnia) is pretty much totally childish in its point of view and stuff. I don't remember all of it but I remember agreeing with it and thinking him the bigger man for including sexuality in the His Dark Materials trilogy.

      I think that's a pretty misguided way of looking at it. The key element is style. Obviously, sex happens in both universes, the question is how much attention the author should devote to it. I love George R.R. Martin for his gritty realism, but given that Tolkien was aiming for a high epic style influenced by Beowulf and the like, it would be wrong to judge him inferior for not measuring up in that regard. There is a particular sort of grandeur that derives from maintaining proper decorum.

      I heard, and can back this up with unsubstantiated rumour and hearsay, that the origin of the Uruk-hai in the movie was changed from being a cross-breeding of Orcs and Men to being a cross-breeding of Orcs and Goblin-men, due to the otherwise implications of  <strong>rape.</strong> <br/>

      "Finally, there is a cogent point, though horrible to relate. It became clear in time that undoubted Men could under the domination of Morgoth or his agents in a few generations be reduced almost to the Orc-level of mind and habits; and then they would or could be made to mate with Orcs producing new breeds, often larger and more cunning. There is no doubt that long afterwards, in the Third Age, Saruman rediscovered this, or learned of it in lore, and in his lust for mastery committed this, his wickedest deed: the interbreeding of Orcs and Men, producing both Men-orcs large and cunning, and Orc-men treacherous and vile." (Morgoth's Ring, "Myths Transformed" - Text X) <br/>

So there, it wasn't rape - it was just generations of slavery and brainswashing. Much better.

      You are technically correct. Chickens have neither a vulva nor anus; they have a cloaca, which covers both functions. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Find solace in that, should you find yourself in the position of doing intercourse with a chicken (perhaps, say, to assure to safety of your countrymen), you will in fact be performing vaginal sex and sodomy  <em>at the same time,</em>  and are of a privileged number of mammals to have ever done so [citation needed].

I figured it'd be better than bangin' a website, at least.  At least this has some flesh.  Websites just have cold, hard markup language and a little scripting.  Sodomy with markup language is no good.  An uncooked chicken, however.. <br/>

      I usually have no real problems with DC's continuity, but ever since Infinite Crisis (what...three years ago? Has it really been that long?) it's been absolutely insane. Fortunately, most of it doesn't really affect my main man Batman. <br/>

Except for the totally insipid thing with Jason Todd being back. What the hell is up with that. <br/>

      Yeah, the Knight ain't hurt much with it all.  I don't mind Jason Todd being back, I think he's badass.  Except for when they retconned  <em>Hush</em>  to being that it  <em>wasn't</em>  Clayface and actually  <em>was</em>  Jason Todd. <br/>

Retconning, generally, is bad.  The only exceptions to this is retconning the Golden and Silver Age.  Nobody cares if you change that shit.

      I think this goes beyond what is actually happening in the lives of the  <em>Achewood</em>  characters. It seems that Onstad has been neglecting the machine that creates the comic strip for him, and it has started churning out horrible acid-trip imagery. Luckily, Gary has been called.

      Even with only 255 strips under your belt, you should've realized by now that Achewood often doesn't have a punchline. I'm not one of those people that defends every single thing Onstad does, and I also wish it was more laugh-out-loud funny at times, but this one was actually pretty good what with breaking the fourth wall and Hyderabad, and the last one was just awesomely bizarre.

      I feel I should point out for whoever would like to dis this strip or any of the other "avant garde" strips we've been seeing in recent months the tremendous trade-off Onstad is making as an artist. If you think Onstad has gotten "lazy" or anything like that with the writing, look at how he ups the ante on imagery. Panel 15 with the 'klicking' filmstrip was not easy to produce I can assure you, nor was  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145433/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=02182008">'The Achewood Generator'</a>  or  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145433/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=03172008">'One For The Brits'</a>  or a number of other strips where Onstad went above and beyond in terms of production values so sit down shut up and chew your goddamn brussel sprouts 27 times before swallowing or I'ma havta take my belt off on all y'all...

      Panel eight is revealing. Panel 9, less so. Then we have Gary, who according to the alt-text can fix the Achewood machine, presumably dragging away this jellyfish-chicken hybrid. <br/>

Panel 15 is interesting. As the machinery accelerates, beef's expression goes from mild interest to shock. Whatever the hell the machine is doing, and whatever the fuck Cynthia is, i never want to know.  <br/>

      I believe, and I could be wrong, that the punchline is panels 7, 8 and 9.  Perhaps this is what we, the readers of Achewood, are presented when many of the comments from Ray's prostitute comic were mocking the fact the chicken looked nothing like a chicken .. <br/> 
 <br/> 
.. Regardless, if taken this way the strip seems a lot more funny than the David Lynch nightmare it appears to be at first.

      it's too late for this week, since it's already tuesday, but i would like to request that next week be assetbar's official  <strong>ASHERDAN APPRECIATION WEEK</strong> , to celebrate our most belovedly hated user. i have gotten so much enjoyment out of reading his grumpy posts that i want to give something back to him and i'm sure others feel the same and that's why we need to celebrate asherdan for a whole week next week.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
to prepare for asherdan celebration week i am reading asherdan's old posts on assetbar. one good place to start is  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145433/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uuabb0PGz">here</a> , where he made some really classic asherdan posts. if you find other marvels posted by asherdan please post a link here so we can prepare ourselves for asherdan appreciation week! <br/> 
 <br/> 
one more thing: asherdan, i propose that we create a horrible hybrid of ourselves on assetbar! i mean let's make an account (called "MANFLASHERDAN"?? yes!!) that we both have the password to and which we both post with, and we don't ever identify which of us makes any single post as manflasherdan. i made a temporary email account at j7shipper2@yahoo.com and asherdan, if you agree, then please email me there and we can work out the details. <br/>

      I think what happened is that he lost his "Achewood Generator" somehow. I mean, I see at best three of the five elements here. I think the missing two elements, through their absence, throw into sharp relief the importance of having the full pentagonad, and furthermore how the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and thus...

      Actually, a quick perusal of the site reveals it to be a sort of bio-engineered, living but non-sentient organism designed exclusively as a sex ... partner? ... for humans. When not in use, it just sits there, requiring occasional feeding and watering. <br/>

      It's actually a reference to an Acheworld commentator who used to insist that Onstad was a closet homosexual. This same "retardo" also urged Onstad to have sexual relations with him at all times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I explain this under the impression that you think it was just an offhand insult, although it is possible you laughed because you know who retardo was... but based on the amount of strips you've read under your Acheworld account, I am betting on the former.

      Gary repairs the Achewood machine, but haphazardly, such that the characters, who thus far have been automatons directed humorously by Onstad's writing, are accidentally granted self-consciousness. The comic strip "Achewood" seems to return to normal but shows signs of degeneration, as characters stop speaking in mid-sentence and look around them, or refer to each other by the wrong names, or simply disappear in the middle of a strip unaccounted for. The symptoms become stronger - panels appear out of order, characters begin to simply chant incoherently, primitively. During one attempted story arc, all the characters simply scream in pain for six panels, clawing at themselves. One day there is a strip just of Phillipe, grasping the border of the panel with bloodied flipper, tugging at it, pushing on it, wailing and screaming in primal hate and fear. In the strip the day after that, Ray actually crawls out of the screen and kills you.

      It had been a long two weeks, mused professorhazard, but worth it. At first the cat had refused to leave the hard plastic carrier he'd first captured it in, or even to acknowledge the open grate and dish of tuna. The first three days were nerve-wracking, but then one morning he came down into the kitchen to find a bowl of Dinty Moore chipped beef licked clean. That was the first glimmer of hope, and since then he'd worked for at least an hour before and after work to coax the little grey out. Now, squatting on his haunches with a dish in his outstretched hand, he could just make out the cat's blinking eyes. Perhaps this would be the moment. "Come on, Cassandra," he called, "Come here my little Beefy. Come to professor."  <br/>

      God, Memorial Day on the inlet! It was a yearly rite for the family hazard; Uncle Bernie Hazard had gotten lucky in the markets and managed to transform a small settlement payment from the city into a beautiful house right on the shore. Every year he invited the whole Hazard clan for a party to celebrate the beginning of summer; the end of school; the anniversary of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty--whatever. For professorhazard, it usually culminated in a stagger down Bernie's tidy little dock and a drunken spin in his spiffy motorboat, and it was  usually the highlight of his year--especially if his cousin Janice had also been imbibing liberally, he thought with a smirk. <br/> 
 <br/> 
No such luck this year, but the outboard was in fine form as he roared around the estuary. Then there was a BLUGUMP, and the outboard roared--screamed--stalled. He leaned over the bulwark. The propeller was tangled, and a bit of gore greased the surface of the water, suggesting he'd hit something. A pair of tiny black shoes? Cargo pants? What had happened?

      Oh and by the way, I think that was probably manslaughter of some kind, if it makes you feel better. There was a similar case where Picard accidentally knocked Falcor into a wormhole. I got bored after a couple of pages of courtroom drama but it was definitely moving towards a plea deal.

      Deusoma embraced Molly with open arms, possibly for the last time. She had to end it, and he knew as well. Beef was an aquaintance, but deusoma knew him well enough to know that his life was in no need of any more sorrow. Beef was the kind of cat you just couldn't bear to see in sorrow. No. No longer would he go behind the back of this shell of a cat. As the affair deepened, he saw the already depressed feline deteriorate. He became emanciated. Maybe it wasn't his fault, deusoma thought with a glimmer of hope. Didn't lupus also cause loss of appetite? Or was that the immune system one... Deusoma shook his head. He knew- It's never lupus.

      Catgrl131 stared at the paragraph she'd feverishly slammed out. Proud that there were no misspellings of any sort, she beamishly moved her mouse to remove her heart-staggering work of genius.  <em>Nobody will ever know,</em>  she thought,  <em>these words are my own.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
A lazy mistake of hovering over 'Post' instead of 'Cancel' caused terror to strike! Her finger was on its way down to press the button that would seal her fate yet as much as she could try to divert disaster, she saw her life flash before her eyes. Childhood memories lapping at her retinas. Laughter and birthdays flitted past like  business cards in a Rolodex operated by a highly-skilled secretary. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Milliseconds later, the deafening 'click' of her mouse sounded like a billion dirges moaned at once and after a quick communication between computer and server, her forbidden paragraph was sucked into the page's body and slathered in a yellow previously saved for Post-It notes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>This is ASS as HELL!!</em>  Catgrl131 thought-shouted .  <em>This wasn't meant to be. Nobody was supposed to read that...that was practice for <strong>next</strong> time. Damndamndamndamndamn!!</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Catgrl131 sighed as another reply box was opened. An apology to the Acheworld community was in order.  <em>I hate doing these things...yet, I gotta do it...</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Apprehensive though they were, like children going into the deep end for the first time, she stretched her fingers over the keyboard once more, swearing never to make a mistake like this again...

There are probably others. But not many. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also there are a few strips where Onstad appears. But he's never referred to as the strip author, and there is no indication that the characters see him as such.

      I'm actually a little sick of the constant "you don't think like I do therefore you suck!" attitude I've seen for the last thousand odd strips. While anonymity is nice and prevents what would assuredly be an ass-whupping in real life it doesn't mean be the biggest dick you can just because you can get away with it. I'm all for fun and giving some shit here and there, and I think some of my replies to Asherdan have been the harshest, but fuck guys, it's a comic. Not just a comic, but an incredibly badass comic. Most of your opinions are awesome, funny, or at least entertaining, but what's with the super dick attitude? Let's all crack open some hell of crispy stellas and stare at some rude titties.
