      I don't really think so. A moral to me feels like a code of conduct you should follow when living your life. It's about how you should enforce yourself on the world around you. The world he writes about doesn't even know your there, and is immovable. You can't act on it or change it at all.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fatalism and moralism don't really mix so hot. And I guess McCarthy's fatalistic.

      First off, I have to admit that my initial statement was sort of a joke. Sort of. But because this is the first compelling, non-Pavement-related argument that has been offered me here in the last couple of months, I will say that we seem to differ on the concept of the moral. I'm not gonna write a term paper here or anything, but I don't believe that one can just state flat out that a given work is without a moral. I think the concept itself is pretty solidly subjective. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>No Country</em>  might not have taught  <em>you</em>  anything about how to enforce yourself on the world around you, but someone else (not necessarily myself) might've gleaned from it, say, the moral that if you find a bag of money near a busted drug deal in the desert, check that shit for homing devices before you take it home and DO NOT bring water to any doomed, gut shot Mexican survivors (those may seem mundane, but I stand by their application). Some may not see any code of conduct by which to live your life in  <em>All the Pretty Horses,</em>  while another ( <em>necessarily</em>  myself) may read that the world outside is a pretty fucked up place, but you'd be crazy not to go out into it anyway. Someone reading  <em>The Road</em>  may not....OK, you got me there. I'd be interested to hear peoples' opinions of the moral there. I can't see any besides possibly the fact that "carrying the fire" in a dead world is for suckers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, this is becoming long-winded. Anyway, I stand by the idea of the individual nature of the moral. That's just how I've always thought of it.

      Fair ground for  <em>No Country,</em>  which had a sort of moral to it, but at the same time, I never got the sense from the book or the movie that there was another way that could have gone. Again, the fatalistic aspect of McCarthy. I mean, in  <em>Outer Dark</em>  there's the crime of incest, and you see its various repercussions, and the effects that it has on the sister and the brother who committed it (crime against nature and all), but the moral focus of the novel falls on these three mysterious men who rampage through the countryside slaughtering anyone who comes to their path, digging up the dead and dressing in their clothes, and the judgment they eventually cast upon them is... horrific, but not fair at all. One character goes free, another is doomed to wander, and another is brutally, brutally killed. It's grotesque in the least, but it's not descriptive of any kind of moral code. It doesn't give you a sense that there are powers in the world that recognize your acts and are willing to judge them or reward you for them. These gods, these fates that howl through the darkness, they're little more than rapacious monsters. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for  <em>All the Pretty Horse</em> , I find that to be fatalistic as well. I agree that I got the same thing out of it as you (learning of the pain and suffering implicit in the world), but I don't consider that a moral, myself. It's a fall from innocence, if anything. Sort of a brutal bildungsroman.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
McCarthy gets accused of being a nihilist all the time, and while I wouldn't exactly call that accurate, I can't say he's a moralist at all, either.

      Well, I trust that we both see where the other is coming from to an adequate extent. On to suggestions. I'm on a bit of a Cormac kick these last few months and I want your opinion as to where to turn next. I interrupted  <em>The Border Trilogy</em>  for  <em>The Road</em>  and now I think I want to stay away from the trilogy a little longer (not that I wasn't enjoying it). Have you read  <em>Blood Meridian?</em>  My girlfriend claims that it's a life-changing read, but now I'm really considering  <em>Outer Dark.</em>  Any thoughts?

      I'd go with  <em>Blood Meridian</em> . By a lot of people it's considered his masterwork (I don't entirely agree), and it's probably more conventionally gripping than a lot of his work, especially  <em>Outer Dark</em> . (Though not as much as  <em>No Country</em>  or the Border Trilogy.) It's a great deal more badass than anything he's written. The Judge is one of the most seriously unsettling satanic figures in any modern literature. I personally think McCarthy wrote a High Fantasy novel without really realizing it.

      Oh yeah, but  <em>Outer Dark</em>  is a real minimalist, sort of almost avant-garde kind of book. It has no plot in any real sense. I think he was still trying to figure out what he was doing at that point. And some of his sentences in that book are just plain ridiculous. It's still a worthy read, though, if just for the incest and the three killers raising hell across the country.

Two guys, one of them Jewish, are walking through the maple orchards in Canada. They're looking for good trees to tap (checking by knocking on them), so they can get sap to make syrup.

      My Non-achewood friends have literally fallen over alughing after reading this. <br/>

And as someone who has read the entire unedited Brothers Grimm I can tell you Lie Bot's story is within 20% of being several actualy german folk tales.

      Before, Onstad used complete black to represent  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110416100932/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uuaQqXpgs">darkness</a> , but this time he went with negative space - not just so that he could depict Philippe's persistent reaction of horror at Lie Bot's tale, but because it also symbolizes Philippe's inner experience: the realization that his entire world has turned on its head. Up is down. Good is bad. Pleasure is pain. White is  <em>black.</em>

      "The end! No moral." The juxtaposition of the exclamation mark and full stop (or "period", for yanks) is one of the most genius things about this strip.
