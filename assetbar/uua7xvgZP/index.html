      I never wear tshirts, so to compensate I had these scrolling LED badges that I programmed with stuff that I would like to have on a slogan tee. I've done a couple of Achewood ones and I did all Beef's tshirts from this arc (bar the Liv Tyler one) until one day someone stopped to read the whole thing aloud in front of me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"...Who...Sucks...Plus...I...Got...Depression...." <br/> 
 <br/> 
He just stood staring at me for a full 3 second whilst I muttered "It's uh, it's from a webcomic."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then he walked away. <br/>

I stopped wearing the badges after this.

      You would be shocked how often people would force me to stand still whilst they read it, I once missed a train because the guy who was inspecting the tickets before I got to the platform would not return my ticket until he had read the whole thing and showed his friends and told them what it said. <br/>

      I have this shirt! It's something of a talking point. Recently, I was queueing in a cafe in Berlin, and the girl behind me asked me to turn around so she could read the front. <br/>

Her: ".. plus you got depression.." <br/> 
Me: "Haha, yeah." <br/>
