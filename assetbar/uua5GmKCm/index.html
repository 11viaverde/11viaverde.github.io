      Hey, I could have pulled out a banjo, then made you all listen as I played an original composition which would, in five parts, evoke the coming of age of a boy whose father was lost in the Civil War. That would have  <em>really</em>  killed the mood.  <br/>

      I'm not entirely sure why I got lamed for that, but regardless, here's a recent entertaining story that links in with that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
About two weeks ago here in Austin a MASSIVE storm rolled through at around twelve-thirty at night. Like, tornado-strength winds without the tornado, and massive hail. I woke up and found my roomate in the living room staring out the window. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still drunk with sleep, I remembered that scene from The Road and immediately said, "JAMESON! Y... you need to fill up some buckets with water." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"What?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Water! You got to... got to fill as many things up with water as we can get."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"We're in central Austin. I really don't think it's that big of a deal, dude." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"[i]You got to fill up a bucket with water! Come on! Motherfucker, we will  <strong>regret</strong>  it later if we don't!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Eventually he rolled his eyes, sighed, and filled up about a pint-size measuring cup with water and set it in the middle of the kitchen table. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"There," he said. "That good!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I nodded and went back to sleep.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even in the face of the Apocalypse, I am a fan of sleeping in.

      He woke with the undersides of his eyelids inflamed by the high sun's hammering, looked up to a bland and chinablue sky traversed by lightwires.  A big lemoncolored cat watched him from the top of a woodstove.  He turned his head to see it better and it elongated itself like hot taffy down the side of the stove and vanished headfirst in the earth without a sound.  Suttree lay with his hands palm up at his sides in an attitude of fraility beheld and the stink that fouled the air was he himself.  He closed his eyes and moaned.  A hot breeze was coming across the barren waste of burnt weeds and rubble like a whiff of battlesmoke.  Some starlings had alighted on a wire overhead in perfect progression like a piece of knotted string fallen slantwise.   Crooning, hooked wings.  Foul yellow mutes came squeezing from under their fanned tails.  He sat up slowly, putting a hand over his eyes.  The birds flew.  His clothes cracked with a thin dry sound and shred of baked vomit fell from him.

      At first it sounds weird and funny, but lets face it that if such a thing were to happen, no bomb shelter could defend you and you at least want to die knowing why the hell that bomb went off...there were a lot of videos shown during the cold war to American citizens saying stupid things about taking cover, but I guess giving hope was important to keep order.

      Everyone likes to think they're so much smarter than those government safety videos.  "Oh you couldn't save yourself from an atom bomb by being indoors."  "Haha they told those kids to get under their desks."  Well guess what?  They knew what they were talking about.  You're right that a sheet of drywall couldn't protect you from an exploding nuke--  <em>if it went off right next to you</em> .  At any reasonable distance from the epicenter, you can save your own life by putting whatever material you can find between yourself and that radiation.  Thousands of people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki survived because a table or a wall absorbed most of the heat from the blast.

      It is also a fact that the nuclear weapons invented post ww2 were WAY HUGER than hundreds of Hiroshima bombs put together.  Possibly thousands.  I am kind of too lazy/apathetic to check right now, but the point is that they are way more deadly.

      Your relative distance from the epicenter, as Former Russian President Putin said above, is what matters though.  You could be 500 yards from the epicenter of Hiroshima or 10,000 yards from the epicenter of the latest bomb.  Something blocking radiation will help more than nothing (lightly colored, too).

      I've heard that the long term survivor closest to the blast was a man cleaning the inside of a large stone oven. Could just be a legend though, I don't remember where I read it.
