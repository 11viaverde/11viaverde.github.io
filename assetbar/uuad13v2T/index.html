      Do you think there's any chance that the eastern path leading to the grue was actually in a Zork game?  <br/> 
A path spelling out 'grue' would be the sort of thing that would only be discovered by text-adventurers who made graph-paper maps of their progress.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I imagine Onstad was one of these, because I am happy to project my own neuroses onto people I have never met.

      I'm pretty sure that if you meet a grue, you're dead. That's why you always need to carry a lantern with you. And a jawbreaker. To give to the shark guarding the underwater cave. So you can slip by with the scuba gear you found in the chest. God I want to know what's in that cave.

      it's just a fat sultan. But, give him a piece of gold acquired from the old man across the underwater lake after answering his trivia question, than he will step out of the way of the old rickety door behind him. Behind this door is your girlfriend. <br/>

      Perhaps you could make friends with the Grue by talking to it without ever mentioning or admitting knowledge of the colour blue? <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em><strong>'Languages without a word for blue will not distinguish it from green; such languages are known to anthopologists as "Grue Languages"<br/>
</strong>[Different languages divide the visible spectrum up in different ways: all languages have words for white and black, if a language contains a third term it is always red, a fourth will either be green or yellow, a fifth will be yellow or green, while only a language with six distinct colours will have a term for blue.'</em>   <br/>

      I'm still waiting for Onstad to create an Achewood text adventure.   <br/> 
Looks like he's got some leads on multi-character action. <br/> 
I never got very far on the 'Hitchhiker' one, but I would buy this.

      The Hitchhiker game was really, really good, but this one would kick it in the soft-boiled eggs. Any game where pulling a bruise off your face is a valid option is my kind of game.
