      Maybe they didn't have too many men to compare to in their lives. Like how if you always eat store-brand ice cream that's 50% air, you don't know what real ice cream can taste like.

      I didn't know that it's 50% air, but I do know that of the portion that isn't air, something like 90% is often high fructose corn syrup.  Americans love that stuff.

      All I know for sure is that the cheap ice cream is aerated to decrease the amount of ice cream they have to put in the container. And that they have to include a minimum amount of milk fat by percentage, like 10%.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Which is pretty crazy since whole milk is just above 3%. I guess they actually have to use cream. Or maybe they add back in the extracted milkfat from low-fat milks  <br/>

      since cream is basically all milkfat, it makes sense for ice  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">cream</span>  to have a minimum standard for it.

      Life is a series of surprises, and would not be worth taking or keeping, if it were not. God delights to isolate us every day, and hide from us the past and the future. We would look about us, but with grand politeness he draws down before us an impenetrable screen of purest sky, and another behind us of purest sky. 'You will not remember,' he seems to say, 'and you will not expect.' All good conversation, manners, and action, come from a spontaneity which forgets usages, and makes the moment great. Nature hates calculators; her methods are saltatory and impulsive. Man lives by pulses; our organic movements are such; and the chemical and ethereal agents are undulatory and alternate; and the mind goes antagonizing on, and never prospers but by fits. We thrive by casualties. Our chief experiences have been casual.

      that depends what the dialect is for. If it's to mark out a special in-group, like cockney rhyming slang, it'll  include lots of redundancy, but only the in-group knows what to put in to make it authentic.

      You know, maybe the backlash wouldn't have been so bad if Onstad had held back the cat-cock comic for a week or two so he could post the next one the following day.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again I think maybe he's less interested in pleasing us than in writing what he wants to write. If he has readers, then he has readers. Better to lose some of the chaff than compromise your artistic vision.  <br/>

      Almost. It still doesn't remove the possibility that these were unrelated events that he decided to mash together to get a conclusion. <br/>

Onstad seems to enjoy setting up a scenario, becoming enamored with it and then dwelling on it for as long as he can, then he might pull back something else from earlier in and try to make it related. It's really very stream-of-consciousness most of the time. The trick to doing it well is to learn how to connect the unrelated dots.

      I think he would be into giving someone arsenic in their food every day, smiling and gazing into their eyes every morning as they chew and swallow their good country potatoes and eggs, watching as they are slowly sapped of their vitality, hearing them as they run to the bathroom, where they may vomit in privacy, wondering why this is happening to them until their mind can no longer function, their eyes are fading, and as they swallow the last dose in a cup of nourishing broth held by their old friend Pete, he whispers the truth to them, a warm glow filling him up inside as he sees the understanding in their eyes.

      There was actually a group of people in Austria, largely miners, who eat arsenic trioxide spread on bread with butter as a health tonic. I could actually see Nice Pete consuming this folk remedy himself (on a base of good country potatoes simply dressed with mock vinegar and corn oil) as a prevention for many afflictions.

      I imagine it'll end in the next comic. Nice Pete will drop Teodor off and leave him with some words of wisdom and encouragement to continue on down his path, but maybe clean it up a bit, and drive off into the night. Somehow, he will not go away for any amount of prison time even if T reports him, because this is Acehwood.

      I've been wondering about something. You know when you have to share public transport with a lunatic? If one were to try to out mad them, by means of hand gestures, and sobbing, and wild claims about the Masons, would they back off, or would they be glad to have found a kindred spirit? Do crazy people like each other's company, or would you run the risk of antagonising the person in question? Because a couple of weeks ago I had to spend a ten minute tube ride pretending to read a book as a distressed indigent muttered to himself about 'thread thieves' and it was pretty awkward.

      Being a frequent user of public transport myself, I would guess that it would only make things worse, since one way it makes them mad, and the other it makes them your friend, and you do not want either one really. Once at the bus stop there was a guy who, though wearing normal clothing, was circling about, then every 10 seconds or so from about 15 feet away he would charge towards me going "WAUAUG WUAAAAA!" the first time I jumped back thinking he was going to attack me, but he did the same thing several times in a row. If I had participated it would have just become a ram-like duel, which may be what he wanted. Perhaps he had stayed up all night watching wildlife shows and dropping acid, and now felt I was in his territory.

      One time back in life I ran into a particularly crazy bus person.  At the stop he flailed at cars, yelled at the top of his lungs (perhaps to whatever arcane god this appeals to?) and otherwise wailed nonstop about some female he cared about who was definitely *not* a whore.  After much hullabaloo I was given reprieve from this bizarre mixture of compassion and trepidation he was making me feel when he did not get on the bus. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Three stops later, the man got on.  I spent the next 15 minutes immune to his waxing and waning raving and clear upset because I was completely confounded as to how he beat the bus to three stops down a street to get on. At the time I could only conclude that my business with him was not yet done.  Out of the blue I thought that what he needed was comfort instead of everyone pretending fiercely as if he did not exist.  It is completely out of character for me to hug anything, but I felt compelled to hug this clearly deranged and dangerous individual and to wish him a nice day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Because it was such a strange concept for me I spent the next 10 minutes in internal debate as to why this idea would even occur to me.  I stood up as my stop was nigh and I continued the internal debate.  As my stop came up I suddenly became aware that he was right in front of me, within elbowing range.  I suppose this is a mark of how caught up in my obsessions and oblivious to my surroundings I can become.  Anyway, the crazy man does the craziest thing imaginable: <br/> 
 <br/> 
He hugs me.  He tells me to have a nice day.  He goes and sits down and I exit the bus. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To this day I remain convinced that you cannot out-crazy someone who is insane, they will anticipate and beat you to the punch.  Also, maybe this was a religious experience?  After seeing a ten inch cat cock (at least a large portion thereof) I am now convinced that the former is a more likely candidate than the latter.

      Actually being able to read anyone's thoughts mean you would read your own thoughts. That would add a new thought to your head. Recursively you would instantly just die from over-thinking. Head all exploding like a trash bag full of marinara sauce dropped from a skyscraper.

      I spent three months homeless when I was living in northern California a few years ago. Primarily, I spent my time playing video games on my expensive (at the time; it's now merely adequate) gaming rig on stolen power, sleeping in an abandoned car, drinking coffee (so that the Starbucks wouldn't kick me out), showering at a nearby truck stop, and doing enough day labor/collecting enough cans to keep the coffee money rolling in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One morning, about 4:30 or so, I was playing Oblivion on my computer on the back steps of a local library. A man who looked suspiciously (in retrospect) like the dude from Ace of Cakes came up to me, asking me questions. We talked for a bit; it is incredibly liberating to be a crazy street-person, especially if you're a heavily armed, high-tech street person. Long story short, he was convinced that I was a Zhell, a type of human-like being bred by the insurance company that took his on away and used as communications devices only to taunt him. By the middle of the conversation I was afraid for my life. by the end of the conversation I had knocked him cold, packed up my gear, and marched on to a new hiding place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My point is, don't try to out-crazy homeless people. You end up playing into their delusions and next thing you know it's club or be clubbed.

      Okay, so something really amazing happened to me a couple days ago, and I wanted to post it on here because it kind of relates to your story (that I was totally touched by) but I wasn't sure if people would be into it or not. I rarely post on here, so I'm not exactly, you know... an established personality whose personal anecdotes you might find interesting. You might just be like, "who are you and why do you think we are interested in your life." <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I'm gonna tell the story anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This Tuesday I had a really crummy day that left me feeling stressed and grouchy. Depressed and wallowing in self-pity, I decided that I really fucking needed a slice of cake. After a huge internal battle, as I am both supposed to be eating better and low on cash, I drive to the nearest grocery store (Raley's) and head over to the bakery. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I see this beautiful slice of chocolate cake. The lady behind the counter says, "Would you like another? It's buy one get one free." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I said, "Fuck yes," got two slices of chocolate cake and sat in my car to stuff my face, listen to Lady Gaga and feel sorry for myself. Like a champ. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I eat the first slice of cake and realize that I'm actually quite full now, and feeling much better. "I could definitely eat this second slice," I thought to myself, sizing it up, "but I really don't NEED to." So I close the box up and start the car. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Across the shopping center parking lot, I see this middle-aged homeless man with an enormous backpack, shuffling along by himself. I immediately understand what I'm supposed to do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I start the car, and drive after him. Unfortunately, it's a huge shopping center, and I soon lose him. So I drive around the complex, looking behind every building, checking every alley, totally straight up stalking this homeless guy. After about ten minutes, I finally see him over by the Burger King. Unfortunately, there are no parking spots, and I am now totally late for an appointment... after another 5 minutes or so of trying to find one, I see an opening and cram my car in as fast as I can. By this point, the homeless guy is super far away, I'm late for my appointment, and I'm starting to wonder if this is, in fact, a safe/sane idea. But by this point I am totally committed to the idea of giving away my cake, so I leap out of the car and tear across the parking lot after the guy, yelling, "HEY MISTER! HEY MISTER!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
FINALLY he hears me and stops. I catch up, panting like an idiot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Hey, do you want some cake?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
The man's mouth drops open. He stares at me for a few seconds, then asks, "How did you know?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I laughed. "Well, I mean, everybody likes cake!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"No, no," he said, shaking his head. " <em>Today is my birthday.</em> " <br/> 
 <br/> 
Completely shocked, I hand him the cake and said, "Well, happy birthday." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The man started crying, carefully holding the cake like it was the most fragile and precious thing in the world and said, "This is the first birthday present I've gotten since I was a little kid." <br/> 
 <br/> 
He then sort of steeled himself, punched the air with his fist and yelled, "Right on, man! RIGHT ON!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
All in all, it was way fucking better than stuffing my face and listening to some more Lady Gaga. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As soon as I got back in the car, I remembered your story about hugging the homeless guy, and thought, "dude, I should totally tell him/her." But Assetbar was broken, so I had to wait two days. But yeah, here ya go!

      This was the first time I ever bothered to mark my feelings on an asset (pro).  I don't even know if marking it that means anything (website-wise), which is why I never bother.  Your story means so much to me it is hard to describe.  I can only give it context with a memory; <br/> 
 <br/> 
One time back in life I was offered some drugs by an authority figure. The drug smelled and tasted like cherries in the way that the twisted minds behind cough syrup imagine cherries to be.  The man told me to count backwards from 100 and I only recall getting to 93. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I awoke I had an IV in each arm as well as one in my jugular. Also they had intubated me.  I was immediately frustrated because the light in the room came through a window and was that sort of post-dawn or pre-dusk light, leaving me unsure of what time it was.  Disorientation on top of intubation is a veritable failure of existence.  I noticed that my mother was in the room and indicated a desire to not be in this situation by flailing my hand limply.  My mother was caught up in the allure of this attempt at a communique. Apparently there is nothing more adorable than the helpess pleading for assistance.  I knew then that my best strategy for getting aid was to play into this and through miming managed to get a writing tool as well as some paper.  After scrawling about my love for my mother I expounded upon what really wieghed on my mind: getting this thing out of my throat and maybe even some water (intubation is to your throat what a flood is not). <br/> 
 <br/> 
My point is that this memory of my first open heart surgery is one of my first memories in life (I was four) and it fostered in me a deep sense of disappointment in humanity.  It is difficult to have a need and not be taken seriously.  Obviously it has been compounded by my life, which has certainly been an unusual one, but essentially between my natural tendency toward obsession and personal experiences I often ponder man's inhumanity to man with an intensity that borders on panic.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-social, I'm just a misanthrope.  I hate people and all the things they do.  What differentiates it is that a misanthrope understands that they are people, too, and they hate themselves for all of those same reasons.  It's things like your story that keep me going. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thanks.

      There's really nothing I can say. I feel a little ridiculous being so self-conscious when you offered up an extremely painful and personal memory for all to see. So maybe I will give in to this need to share and connect without worrying if anyone else on this website thinks I'm Silly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is no way to defend an inherent love/optimism for mankind, especially to someone whose story you don't know, because it's inevitable that everyone has gone through at least one traumatic and horrifying experience that had the power to knock their emotional lights out and rip out any shred of love or trust they had within them. Not that I am belittling your feelings or your experiences at all, believe me, I am so incredibly sorry that you had to endure what you did, and at such a young age... I just mean that with experiences and memories like this, it's very difficult to expect anyone to believe you when you try to say Everything is Going to Be Okay. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In fact, a lot of people find it really condescending when you try and tell them that it's all going to work out, don't worry, it's going to get better. Unfortunately, I think it's in many many many people's nature (myself included) to want to coddle and nurture and help, even when it's not wanted, or perhaps even harmful. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's because of these conditions that I don't know what to say. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know I can never convince you that people are good and that it's okay to let go and trust that they will treat you with the love and respect that everyone wants and deserves. I also know that it was a very real possibility that the homeless guy I gave the cake to could have been a crazy rapist, and that my actions were probably more reckless than anything else. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Because sometimes, people are terrible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And sometimes, people are... impossible to look at. A humiliating, terrifying and seemingly hopeless group of monsters. I know that we have all probably felt like aliens visiting from another planet, and that everything in the world from social situations to murder to interior decorating to shoe shopping seems like a laughably foreign and bizarre ritual you are only witnessing from the outside. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know there is nothing that I can say to convince you otherwise, but I still feel like I have to try. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Because I firmly believe that it is within all of us to love and honor and give and share and connect. Deep down, we all want to take care of each other. And even though I know it's possible that you will never agree with me, I still need to tell you these things because doing so proves that at the very least, it is within me to care about and love YOU. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Regardless of who you are or what you've done or what you are capable of, you are made of the same stuff that I am, and I promise you that, as a fellow human, the underlying emotion behind everything I could ever possibly feel for you is one of love and support. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This may all sound like a lot of overly sentimental and bizarre bullshit, especially in the context of a public forum, but really, dude. I see you as a flawed and wonderful being who is capable of some of the most kind and beautiful acts known to our universe, as well as being capable of some of the most deplorable and horrifying crimes that one could ever commit. And I will always love you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So even if you don't believe it with regards to our species as a whole, please know that at least one stranger cares about you and would totally give you a slice of cake right now if she could. <br/>

      Dang and shoot, I was mostly just drunk when I wrote that (ok, maybe I am drunk now as well).  That story is hardly a personal one, and scorpio got it right below; my surgeon was brilliant (for both open hearts). Seriously, my life has made open heart surgery a mundane experience so while I understand how this seems to be in the 'normal sense' my intent was not to add such gravity as a man who sports a bloatee has but merely to give context to how awesome I thought your reply was (and why).

      As time went on we saw less and less of Nathan, until eventually he became just another face in town. It happens sometimes. Friends come in and out of your life like busboys in a restaurant. The last time I'd heard, Nathan had spent some time in jail. He was now doing odd jobs around Castle Rock. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Darren enrolled in the college courses with me, and, although it was hard, he gutted it out like he always did. He went on to college and eventually became a lawyer. Last week he entered a fast food restaurant. Just ahead of him, two men got into an argument%u2014one of them pulled a knife. Darren, who had always made the best peace, tried to break it up. He was stabbed in the throat. He died almost instantly. Although I hadn't seen him in more than ten years, I know I'll miss him forever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I never had any friends later on like the ones I had in high school. Jesus, does anyone?

      The issue is not the actual lived experience of high school, but the Platonic ideal of HIGH SCHOOL (imagine a Wagnerian aria of your choice to play in yr head while those words are read) instilled in us almost right from birth.  It's what innumerable teen movies sell us (see above), what countless AM hits immortalize, and it's what's in play in Nice Pete's dark pantomime. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This ideal is an illusion, but it is one whose shadow we live under before, during, and forever after our true high school lives, whatever those might be (only and actually life).

      That is exactly the case. Kansas City. I moved to San Francisco for slightly other reasons though. One of which was living as far away from my parents as feasible. And since my mother's family is on the east coast I didn't have a lot of options.

      I know everyone is supposed to have had really gritty and troubled teenage years, but I enjoyed going to school. A fair number of my current circle of friends are people I knew at school, including most of my closest ones. University, on the other hand, consisted of me feeling bored and lonely for three years. I think that due to being naturally standoffish I just make friends better when I am forced into close proximity with people, like at school or in an office. University gave me too much time to spend sitting on my own in libraries or in front of the telly. I was a pretty happy teenager. Looking back on it that probably has something to do with the fact that looking old enough to buy booze for parties is more of a social accomplishment when one is 15.

      Different ones. Definitely different. It was like "before LSD" and "after LSD", if you know what I mean.  <br/>

 They say you can't go back there, and that's true, nor should one want to; but just being able to look back and see is comfort enough.

      As we enter month three, <br/> 
I wish I could flee <br/> 
From this arc of great horror <br/> 
Found South of the Border. <br/> 
 <br/> 
T rode with Nice Pete <br/> 
Who offered to treat <br/> 
But delivered instead <br/> 
Some blows to the head. <br/> 
 <br/> 
T's forced to pinch a loaf <br/> 
And confronted by an oaf <br/> 
Who mistakes him for an addick <br/> 
But doesn't shoot him right quick. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"You ain't shoot a doody-boy on a acid trip. <br/> 
...They got all them  <em>active pathways</em> ." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lurquilla and Mayner <br/> 
The chernchilla trainers <br/> 
Lost all in the fire <br/> 
When they built a pyre <br/> 
Over T's bowel movement. <br/> 
It was an improvement. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The waitress on the night shift <br/> 
Could but let Nice Pete drift <br/> 
From table to table to <br/> 
Solicit what he's able to. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pity poor Nathan,  <br/> 
He's encountered a Satan. <br/> 
In return for his ardor <br/> 
He'll not meet with Carter. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The homecoming queen <br/> 
Says might as well come clean. <br/> 
Now witness caged heat <br/> 
Performed with aged meat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Will that enrage Pete <br/> 
or tickle his feet? <br/> 
 <br/> 
What was T pulling on? <br/> 
Ol' Nathan's big lingam? <br/> 
Or was it his jeans <br/> 
To be used as a means <br/> 
To bust open the lock <br/> 
And avoid sucking cock? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Soon we will learn <br/> 
Just how this worm turns. <br/> 
The deadline's been beat: <br/> 
We got update, not tweet.

      Note that I had to qualify "recent" history because of the Great Fire of 1666, when Thomas Farriner attempted to prove that placing chinchillas in an oven immediately before baking country rye bread keeps the loose grains on the outside from burning and obtaining an unpleasant smokey taste. <br/>

"A  device  for  changing  the  airflow  past  a  moving  vehicle,  often  having  the  form  of  a  transverse  fin  or  blade  mounted  at  the  front  or  rear  to  reduce  lift  and  increase  traction  at  high  speeds". <br/>

      Also please note that dictionaries are not sources of facts. They imperfectly describe language as it is used. If the usage of language changes, the dictionary must change to document it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is, if a whole lot of people use "mayhem" to mean "loosely directed destruction" even if said meaning is not in the dictionary, it is improper to appeal to the dictionary to correct that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not sold on continuing that argument to things like spelling. I think it's a social good that vocabulary and structure be mutable, but that spelling be standardized. Perhaps this view will be seen as quaint and closedminded in 50 years when everyone uses text-speak.

      Depends. Waxing is nice, but then you have that period when it's growing back in and you can't do anything about it. Shaving is more high-maintenance, but it'll stay smooth. That is, if you don't have sensitive skin that's incredibly prone to ingrown hairs. Some ladies can't shave without making the situation arguably worse.

I approve of close trimming. It can be maintained anytime, you don't get razorburn or ingrown hairs, and the hair usually remains fairly soft.  <br/>

A dude who wants a girl to get waxed needs to see what it feels like to get a strip of testicle-hairs ripped out all at once before pressing the issue.

      Pete seems to have had an exagerated, psychopaths idea of high school hi-jinks, he egged Teodor on to do the vandalism at the chinchilla-house, then went and picked up a gay guy, and then intended to return to chinchilla house and throw Teodor and gay guy out in flagrante delicto, to embarrass him.  Ha ha, yeah, thats funny, to a pyschopath.   <br/>

Just one thing noone seems to have seen, Teodor was engaging in homoerotic activity with the old dude in the strip before the cat cock was unsheathed.

      Nice Pete has the uncrowned emperor of all manwhores in his trunk. Consider the depth of Nathan's addiction to the cock: A naked and obviously mentally disturbed stranger was all the motivation needed to get him into that van. After his geriatric ass was beaten into unconsciousness, his first and only thought on waking up was how to get his dick wet in the 5 minutes he had left on this earth.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nathan is a man who, if you suspended a fake penis from a fishing rod and tucked it into his shirt collar, would gleefully chase that dong into freeway traffic with outstretched arms and singularity of focus. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When that motherfucker learns that there are several dozen soggy chinchillas nearby, ain't no force on earth can stop him from breaking out of that van Kool-Aid style to get his fuck on. <br/> <br/> <br/> As the scene transpires, Teodor can use his gourmand vocabulary to share with us the subtle nuances of what AIDS tastes like.

      okay I'll try again <br/> 
 <br/> 
it's like when there is a sports game somewhere in another time zone on another contienent <br/> 
 <br/> 
so they broadcast it with a tape delay of several hours <br/> 
 <br/> 
so you have the choice of tune in live at 2am or wait and watch it at 2pm.  As long as you pretend it's live, you'll have fun. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Since the people doing the broadcasting have delayed it, they know exactly how long it's going to last, and if they wanted to, they could tell you exactly how long it's going to last at the start of the show. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Think of the time between strips as the length of the show. <br/>

is any of this starting to register now pikahue?

      This is largely true. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, how often have you ever woken up with a chubby and because it was there and she was there you had sex. Or, at least, you tried to have sex. Sometimes putting more effort into making it happen than you even really desire it yourself, just because... well, it's  <em>possible</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sometimes erections feel like going to bathroom before a long trip in the car: you might not feel the need to do it, but it's a good idea to do it while you have the chance because you don't know when you'll be able to next.

 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>But the way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright. He'd be damned if any slopes gonna put their greasy yellow hands on his boy's birthright, so he hid it, in the one place he knew he could hide something: his ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Well, I was with him at the very end...he started to hallucinate, thought he was taking to an angel or spirit...he'd say things like "Clarence! Clarence! Help me, Clarence! Get me back! Get me back, I don't care what happens to me! Get me back to my wife and kids! Help me Clarence, please! Please! I wanna live again. I wanna live again. Please, God, let me live again." <br/>
<br/>
Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable piece of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you. </em></div>

      <strong>Food review: The McDonalds Fillet-O-Fish</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>THE BASICS</strong> : the Fillet-o-fish is something of a tricky burger to describe.  It is a square fish patty resting ontop of tangy tartar sauce and sandwiched between II buns.  The Fish is breaded with a soft, peel-off-the-fish breading making for an easy bite.  This is not a burger that is diffecult to handle. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Tartar sauce occasionally leaks out the back of the burger, this can lead to some unwanted spills but clean-up is a cinch as the globbules generally stick together, I wipe and you're done.  Simple as dat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>THE FACTS</strong> : Sitting somewheres in the LXXXXIX-CCC cent range makes this burger a cheap and effective means of sating any size hunger.  This small durable food item is served hot-warm in a box-type device like something out of a classic drive-in.  Fans of nostalgia will also delight in it having fish within it, which some theorize are our genetic ancestors. <br/> 
 <br/> 
say [||||] represents your open hand, palm up, fingers out-stretched.  Now say that {  } represents a Fillet-o-Fish, the Fillet-O-Fish would rest exactly [(  }] on your palm.  (To give you some idea of the size of the food item.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>THE OPINION</strong> : The Fillet-O-Fish my number I favourite burger-snack from the McDonalds resteraunt.  Namely for its soft bread-texture and unoffending breading on the fish itself, it makes for an eating sensation I wish to relieve everyday.  Never overcooked, never undercooked, the Fillet-O-Fish has yet to disepoint in preparation (unlike their cow-burgers which I have undercooked and thrown away.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
For me the Fillet-O-Fish says II things: a)Simple, can't-fuck-this-up design, and b) Simple, affordable flavor and a great source of vitamin A. <br/>

      Best followed rapidly by a quart of Mountain Dew.  <br/> 
This cleanses the palate for the main course of real fish, gently grilled, with a light lemon/herbal sauce, and an unwooded chardonnay or semillon blanc.

oak I wrote something here I will air it out on assetbar this is fresh from my brain cells only 2 minutes ago here it goes: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em><br/>
<strong><br/>
Leisha was like "I have to go to work" <br/>
</strong> (we was chatting on facebooks)<strong><br/>
and I was like "don't forget to wear pants"<br/>
and she was like "thanks"<br/>
and then I was thinking to myself, well, a funny thing to say would be "unless you're a stripper whore, then you should probably remember to not wear any pants"<br/>
although, she might take that in an insulting sort of way too I suppose<br/>
<br/>
so then I realized I had just created a brilliant piece of comedy<br/>
<br/>
because you know how the stereotypical nightmare is about being at work and suddenly realizing you forgot to wear any pants<br/>
<br/>
well if you are a stripper whore, then the opposite typical nightmare would be that you are at work, but you forgot to leave your pants off.  and everyone is looking at you and laughing.  because you're a stripper whore. And wearing pants is of course ridiculous. Because you're a stripper and people can't see your cunt if you're wearing pants.  Even if you leave out the panties the pants still fuck it up.  see that's why it's so funny.<br/>

      holy shit I had the craziest dream last night where I dreamt the next comic for Achewood. Basically it was like nothing in the last several comics had happened at all. Teodor and Phillipe were sitting at a bar serving drinks and they both had frikkin' badass 'staches and sunglasses. I can't remember anything else from my dream, but yeah it was weird.

      Yeah, they live on mountains at elevations where there's not any rain or snow, and they avoid bodies of water. They clean themselves by rubbing volcanic ash in their fur which pushes out any other particulates.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
They evolved to a very, very specific climate; it makes them kind of a pain in the ass to keep as pets, you have to buy them special dust with the right silicates and whatnot for them to bathe, and their incredibly fine fur makes overheating an issue. That said, they're pretty entertaining; their acrobatics put mice and rabbits to shame, and they are pretty cute.  <br/>

      I just realized-- Teodore has shown some homosexual qualities in the past. He half-jokingly tried to cyber Vlad once. I seem to remember him getting a little turned on by Hiram the blacksmith. And not too long ago, he sported a do-rag and sunglasses-- coming thiiiiiiis close to banging Rod Huggins on the set of picnic panic. This is what I remember off the top of my head... how many more clues have there been?? I thought it was impossible, but, Teodore may actually be sucking a mean dick in the back of that van right now.
