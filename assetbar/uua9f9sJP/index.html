      No. Jesus was from the motherfuckin  <strong>middle-east two millenia ago</strong>  you monumental retard. The English language  <em>didn't even EXIST then</em> , and to this day a goodly portion of people in that part of the world still do not speak it. And yes, that accounts for both English AND American. <br/>

      I will sass you.  I'm going to get it wrong on purpose from now on.  No doubt a lameass will crap out multiple lames on my anonymized internet persona for every infraction (not that I'd  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145836/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/one_comment?b=M^a11f09b8576e606bcb5038dfdb92fb821&amp;a=M^1312&amp;c=45">name names</a> ), but will sass you nonetheless.  I'll start now: <br/> 
 <br/> 
You make us use BBCode because writing a dog's code is above your grade level.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your avatar is the knife they used to cut off the balls you'd need to create a friendlier GUI. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We have to go to [url=https://www.ohnorobot.com/index.pl?comic=636&s=parks like a bitch&search=Find]OhNoRobot [/url] to find the strips we want to link to because you have no search function.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Other messageboards see your rabid users and think, "Man, I could never inspire rabid users like that messageboard."  Then they read these complaints about your interface and say, "Huh, guess that was no messageboard at all, just a BBCode storefront." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your methods for sorting the comments in our Inbox and Sent folders are so inadequately explained. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is ugliest code, written in MS Word 3.0.

      lateadopter, I would like to add the following rebuttal to your REDICULOUS claim. Stating that I gave you "multiple lames" for your failure to properly BBCode is an OUTRAGEOUS lie. Pretending that I did so is just a waste of EVERYONE'S time. If I did lame you, it was probably because I did not enjoy the content of your message.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not going to lame you yet, but I would be completely within my rights to do so. <br/>

      Yes indeed, Man Man rules. I guess it's not really stoner rock per se, but it's rock played by stoners, and so the hi-larious pun works. Also, they played the 'Weeds' theme song a couple of weeks ago (and I think all the other songs in that episode was from their 'Six Demong Bag' album).

      Funny thing here is that I inadvertently started this whole thing off, when Questionable Content (which, ironically, has very little content that could be described as "questionable," a fact not lost on the author) is the webcomic that got me into webcomics in the first place.  And I still read it, even though it hasn't made me laugh in a while, has always had consistent indie rock references that I don't get  <strong>or</strong>  care about, and I haven't bought a shirt there either (unlike, say,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145836/https://www.drmcninja.com/">Dr. McNinja</a> ).

      Fear not Skradley, for I am amoungst them. QC is like some very, very mild form of smack. It only steals a minute of my day, yet I go back to keep up. I suspect it's the innocence of it all, in the face of a indy-rock culture of irony. It's like listening to a visual/text version of commercial radio once in a while.

      It was the comic that got me into webcomics as well, and there's still a part of me that holds a fondness for it. There's also a part of me that thinks that other part is a total pussy. I suppose that's the part that likes achewood.

      As long as we are all confessing (and this is extra hard for me, seeing as I was the one who brought QC up in the first place), I started reading Questionable Content at about the same time I got into Dinosaur Comics, Dr. McNinja and Achewood. I stopped after I realized nothing was ever going to happen, but the strip has a clever way of fooling you into thinking that some drama and/or conflict (or even a joke!) is right around the corner. Just...one...more...strip... <br/> 
And for an even more shameful confession, I actually like a lot of the bands referenced in the comic. If I could 'lame' myself, I would...

      Honestly, I don't care what comics other people want to read, and I'm a bit regretful that my first post here has me coming off like an elitist jerkbag. But the thing is, this is the first time anywhere on the Internet I've seen more than one person in the same place with a dislike for QC. It is immensely popular, and whatever appeal it has is completely lost on me, much like women's shampoo to Roast Beef. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also: There's no reason to suspect that Beef didn't call Molly right after he saw the Brookingham bath products. He probably assumed, when the phone cut out, that picking up shampoo would be an easy task with no need to call her back. <br/> 
 <br/> 
More also: Holy hell did I have to wait a long time before I could post this reply. Presumably this passes after I'm not a brand new member... I understand it's for anti-spam and all, but I didn't even need to confirm an email or even enter a captcha I mean  <em>come on!</em>

      I had this problem, but I did nothing about it.  Now, only because a stranger on the internet asked for it, I went to the Customize Firefox page and found an extension that fixed it.  Go there and search for "Fit Bookmark Icon."  Or, trust a stranger on the internet and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145836/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2982">click here</a> . <br/>

      A day after reading this post I bought Green Tea and Lime conditioner, half because of how good it smelled and half because of Roast Beef. I hope you're happy, Onstad.
