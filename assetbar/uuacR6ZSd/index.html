      I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so, the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, I saw the shadow of no parting from her.

      Don't want to get hell of flamed for this, but I actually enjoyed South Park's adaptation. They played it mostly straight, very well done, and edited into a manageable 22-minute format.  Not that that's the preferred way to consume a classic work of literature, but it was a fun departure.

      i know it is wicked typical and a bit cliche to say, but i totally think that none of dicken's other works come close to the brilliance that is David Copperfield. and that is saying a lot, considering the regard held for all of his work. 1850's were an exciting time for literature, with Copperfield defining the modern bildungsroman and huck finn damning the failure of the civil war and reconstruction.

      Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night.  It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.

      Ha, it is obviously my own predisposition to Dickens, but I always felt the sleep came not from boredom or disinterest, but from a sort of comfort, the rhythmic, gentle reading of a bedtime story.   <br/>

One gets the impression that bedtime stories were not on order in Circumstances.

      People who think Dickens is boring should read E.M. Forster.  Start with  <em>Howards End</em> .  If you can get a hundred pages in without clawing your eyes out over the sheer, frustrating, pointlessness of that book, I'll give you a dollar. <br/>
