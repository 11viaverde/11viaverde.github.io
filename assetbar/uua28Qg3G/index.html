      Little is said, but once her dark secret is revealed, the alarmed protagonist attempts to escape. With the help of her athletic brother, the ever more bitter heroine catches her once lover and has him locked in the basement. His next sight of her is a silohuette in the light of the doorway at the top of the stairs, crutch in one hand and whip in the other. <br/> 
With the relationship having taken a sinister turn, we can only wonder... where will it go from here?

      That is no word poem, my friend.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fully 90% of the time you see a link with with the term mesothelioma, it's SEO spam with an advertisement on it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The random obscure words on there are for when people use bizarre terms like you've used and they're the only hit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's because, for quite some time, 'mesothelioma' fetched the highest per-click reward on Adsense. <br/>

      Whenever I hear Cornelius talk in my head, he sounds either like Stephen Fry or Alec Guinness as George Smiley from  <em>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.</em>   <br/>

Maybe the latter. Short, fat, big, thick glasses, almost entirely unaware that the world has been modernized, and fond of books no one's heard about.

Here are just two of the various reasons why: <br/> 
 <br/> 
#1. Toff American. Super-rare by my rating. Americans just aren't supposed to have that old-fashioned upper class feel to them. There certainly wasn't any suggestion as far as I'm aware that Cornelius was from anywhere else though, and he sure is retroposh. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#2. Pasta. Remember the Badass games? Loyd Grossman claims to have invented at least two types of pasta. For that matter the underlying food theme is present with both of 'em. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Totally logical conclusion, if you ask me. <br/>

Also, what would proscriptive linguistics be, if it were a thing? <br/>

Also, I do think it is hilarious that "literally" has developed a usage in which it means the exact opposite of what it usually does.  That's a rare honor for a word.  Like "bad" or "sick" or stuff like that. <br/>

      While there are a great many things that embarrass me about my home state (the governor, the legislature, the glorification of stupidity), the unofficial state dish is not one of them.  Only here in Texas will you find the true expression of the sublime chicken fried steak.  There's something about beef that's been battered, fried, and covered in white gravy that brings a tear to my eye. <br/>

The official state dish is chili, but everybody knows who the REAL king is.

      I've always thought that Achewood has a parallel to the Hundred Acre Wood. Beef is Eeyore, totally. Ray would probably be Tigger, Philippe would be Piglet, I guess, and Pat would be Rabbit.

      Clearly Pooh would have to be whichever character you could write a book about called "The Tao of XXX."  So far "The Tao of Ray" is the one that makes the most sense to me.  Although it's admittedly not perfect, I can imagine a sentence along the lines of, "While Roast Beef frets, and Pat chastises, and Lyle pukes, Ray simply  <em>is</em> .

      Cornelius should totally replace Winnie the Pooh. Pooh has been going downhill ever since he started turning tricks for Disney. I heard that he's now virtually a shut-in, eating up to forty jars of honey a day, has to be propped up by Piglet when he goes on stage, stands there sweating and swaying for about ten minutes before being booed off. Cornelius can beat that.
