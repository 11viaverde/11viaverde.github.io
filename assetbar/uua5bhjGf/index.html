      I always found it nice when the LHC is mentionned, it is the first time i've heard mainstream media talk about a high science experiment, except a possible cure for cancer/HIV or warfare. Even if we dn't find the Higg's Boson, i think it is worth it.

      Exactly. Particle physics is cool and while I love science with no direct practical application much of that realm of physics is not likely to ever yield much. Basic level biology, however, might not have direct benefits, but it will have long-term benefits once other researchers use it to complete work with more direct benefits.

      Yes it will be awesome.  What would also be awesome is if you guys would quit apostrophe splicing the damn thing before it is even observed.  It is named for Peter Higgs, not Higg.

      I agree there's no hope for time travel on large scale, wolfie, except for maybe tossing some particle forward in time.  But once the Higg's boson is indentified, control of "gravitons" will not be far behind.

They have a Facebook app where you "sacrifice" 10 of your friends (remove them from your friends list) to get a coupon for a free Whopper. Unfortunately it only works once. I shed 10 unnecessary college acquaintances and I didn't even have to touch the Assetbar people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As much as I hate commercialism, a major corporation using a human sacrifice-themed marketing ploy is possibly commendable in some way.

      Burger King has almost always had free refills. It seems that most fast food places nowadays do unless they're limited for space and in a mall or such and McDonald's rarely does. But Burger King and Taco Bell and such are pretty big on the whole "get your own damn drink" model. If they don't you might be able to just ask at the counter. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not only do we rarely have fast food around here, but most of the places that do sell cheap food tend to only sell soda in cans at a markup ($1-1.50 a can on average). Even better places often only do cans. It's annoying as hell. I mean, the taqueria selling Mexican soda in bottles I can get behind, but so many other places are just seemingly dicks.

      i live in australia and it is the stuff of legend here that in the glittering jewel that is the US of A,  medium cokes at macdonalds are equivalent to our large sizes. the same goes for our supersized, which equals the US large. i would like to think that this means australia is moderate and self controlled but i am sure the truth is we are just getting schisted. as one of the fattest nations on earth i doubt we would have any issue in washing down our cardboard burgers with even greater amounts of liquid carbonated sugar.

      No, it means that Americans are lardasses who don't understand the concept of "small" and whose average portions are at least 1.5x what any normal person needs to eat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is an Animaniacs episode where Dr. Scratch n' Sniff goes to the movies: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I'd like a small popcorn please." <br/> 
"We don't have small." <br/> 
"Then I'll take a medium." <br/> 
"We don't have medium." <br/> 
"Well what do you have?" <br/> 
"We have Large, Super Chubby, and Double Super Chubby!" <br/>

He ends up getting a large, which he has to carry with both hands.

      But it's a drink! I need more because I'm fucking thirsty here. Gluttony doesn't really apply to drinks. Plus, if you're drinking diet soda you're actually consuming far fewer calories than if you were drinking juice or milk or something else typically considered "healthy". <br/>

A lot of juice is pretty calorically equivalent to soda.

You know, I have been saying that over and over, but today, I changed my mind.  That's because I enjoy the discussions as much -- if not more -- than the strip.  And if we only had a day to bullshit and hate on each other and post gnarly fucked-up crap from the innernets, that would NOT be as much fun as these multi-day cluster fucks.  Am I right, men?

      My girlfriend who turns 26 next week did not know who Yakov Smirnoff was nor was she able to recognize him by sight (I had to explain who everyone other than Stalin was on the Colbert Report's Cold War intro thingie the other day). <br/> 
 <br/> 
So in this case, at least, no. She was also not familiar with the joke because she uses the Internet like my parents do, but not even quite that often. <br/> 
 <br/> 
She's the kind of person who has five bookmarks and doesn't surf around for fun. I think the only people she knows online are people she knows IRL.

      OK, I think we need to deal with the fact that cultural generations are often very different from biological generations. A shift as small as three or four years can put you well out of step with other youth growing up. Trends are different and influences change. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Biologically though, yeah, it's closer to 15-18 years at a minimum. The problem there, however, is that you need to use an even wider range in order to take into account the births occurring from people in the previous generation over a wider period of time as well as their varying ages. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So let's just choose to agree that these are clearly two very different concepts and move on from there.

      Okay.  But three or four years is  <em>not</em>  enough to put you out of step. You can't even tell if anyone is four years older than you in college. In high school, all the different ages like the same music, same fads.  Even in elementary school, sure there is still difference between fads and stuff, but they are still little kids.  My brother and sister are fives years apart (22 and 16--he just had his birthday) and they are  <em>definitely</em>  the same generation, especially since my brother hangs out with people my sister's age, and has been for four years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cultural generations are a very subjective thing I think.  But there has to be more difference than that.

      I think I've said this before, but it depends on when a cultural trend changes or a major event happens. 3 or 4 years makes a huge difference when it falls along certain lines like the divide between people who can remember what life was like before cellphones or the Internet and those who can't (I'd say anyone born more than 3 or 4 years after me probably can't).

      A generation is properly 20 years, the span between birth and breeding. Due to the rapid advancement of technologies and ever-changing fads/subcultures, a pop culture "generation" tends to be much shorter. My ex, six years the younger, and I nonetheless recognized far more of each other's pop references than otherwise. Of course, she was a precocious lass, and came from a part of the country which perpetually wallows about a decade behind the rest.

      If you watched a lot of Nick at Nite and read Mad's "let's reprint stuff we've had around forever" special issues quite a lot combined with reference-heavy programming (Animaniacs, The Simpsons, etc.), and classic rock radio you can actually be fairly conversant in previous generations as well.

      So answer me this then belgand, I am barely 20 which is closer to sje46's age, whilst my boyfriend is 27, which is closer to you, so this makes us a different generation? I mean, I may be biased but I dont think im dating an old man. Not to mention that the perception of generation is itself highly subjective and it depends on what you like, and what people around you like. There are many, many subcultures nowadays and I dont think that you can describe any one of them as belonging exclusively to a single generation anymore. <br/>

      I think that on some levels there may be a cultural disconnect that arises from growing up in different decades. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not that you're dating an "old man" so much as, say, someone on one side of Gen X and someone on the other side of Gen Y. It may only be a few years, but the border is still there. Borders are often tricky things like that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have something like that with my girlfriend and she's not even two years younger than me. <br/>

It is a very subjective and difficult thing, but, in general, I think that we tend to place generations, from a cultural perspective, as being far too long at the present.

      My girlfriend is five years my junior. The only noticeable differences between her and I are that she listens to a bunch of indie bands that I wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole and that when things are bad she sometimes forgets that they will eventually get good again largely because nothing that happens could possibly matter, ever. But in a lot of other ways, she is much more mature than me, so even those differences are pretty offset. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I think that upbringing factors in much more than moderate age differences ever could. We were both brought up by single parents in the lower middle class. Because of that we see eye-to-eye on most real-life issues. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end, I just don't think generational differences matter that much.  <br/>

We all smoke dope, fornicate like rabbits, and don't give a damn about anybody else.

      Man, I never have riff raff at garage sales, it's mostly just weary-looking mothers dragging along kids rooting through boxes of junk on a Saturday afternoon.

No but I think you're right. The average garage sale patron is what you're describing: Families in station wagons, the neighbors ambling over from mowing the lawn, kids on bikes, enough silverfish to fill a grocery bag ... but it's the crazy weirdos who stick in your mind, and come back the next day looking for the rest of the set to match the chipped teacup you sold them.

Garage/yard sale days were fun and non-threatening at best, if you planned your route correctly and could stop at the ice stand before going home and looking over your useless loot.  I never remember weirdos but it's possible I just accepted them as part of the environment.  In fact I'm sure I did.  There were weirdos everywhere where I grew up but I never regarded them as weirdos.

Honestly, it's been over two centuries since the great R.R. Mallory published his practices of individualized miniature servitude and the Crete Vat-Birthing Institution was chartered. I do realize that his exposure has suffered under the fine grind of time, but even excusing the loud defamation that we owe to those damned Evolutionary Naturist, you would think that Mallory's Marvelous Domestic Insectovorian Patrol would have attained ubiquitous deployment in the houses of the civilized world. After all, we've managed to electrify the entirety of the West -- Cultivating so-called "house centipedes" is  <em>much</em>  easier than laying all that wire! And nothing can please a mind that likes to see things in their place more than searching those damp, dark areas and finding a neat little S. coleoptrata humbly on the lookout for the next household pest up for extermination. Why, if only the common people of America could just get over their strange preoccupation with how "icky" they are, we would be naught for even a mention of the outmoded silverfish!

      My friends all freaked out one day when one crawled up from behind my friend's bed in his dorm, becuase apparently centipedes are poisonous?  Or whatever bug it was.  Never heard that in my life; maybe the city pollution internally fumigated the bugs by me growing up.  Long story short, they were all too afraid to kill it.  I don't get how anything smaller than a tarantula scares people, except bees and whatnot, but even those, just don't bug it (no pun intended) and you'll be fine.

      They are without question poisonous as all hell. That's why they're such efficient killers. They're brimming with the stuff. In the rare instance that they bite a human, I've heard that it's not much more than a bee sting. <br/>

      Yep. They're venomous (poisonous is not quite the correct term), predatory carnivores. You don't see centipedes that often in most parts of the US though. <br/>

Millipedes, however, depending on where you live those aren't terribly uncommon. They're totally benign though... just scary as hell.

      You're wrong there. It's cold as hell here most of the time. Summer? Summer here is a cruel joke where the temperature is lucky to rise above 65. That is, not including the fact that the summer is usually very foggy and that if you're ever not in the direct path of the sun it's usually ten degrees or so colder. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's basically always in the 60s here. Winter is low 60s or high 50s and Fall (which is actually our Summer, since Summer is astoundingly cold) is closer to high 60s and occasional low 70s. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We have occasional spurts of actual summery weather about a dozen times a year or so and everyone complains because 75 is apparently way too hot for them.

It's nice when the winter is never particularly cold. I mean, it gets cold, but it's usually more like chilly Autumn than Winter. The problem is that it often doesn't get much warmer than that. It's pretty much eternal Autumn and Summer is one of the colder seasons because of all the fog. The hot inland air hits the cold coastal water and we get fogged in. But at least we don't get rain outside of late Autumn/Winter.

      Hey, I'll gladly agree that winters are a lot better than before I moved. I no longer have to put up with the horrors of snow either. At the same time it's a trade-off where you're going to be chilly all the time and you'll need to own a summer coat.

      No, I'll agree with you in principle. We don't get snow, but we do have pretty tremendous windchill most of the time and as soon as the sun starts dipping in the sky or you're on the shady side of the street it gets notably colder. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The winters are nice. I mean, it's not Southern California nice, but it's better than living someplace with actual cold weather most of the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem is when you have to keep your heat on during the summer. It's not so much the coldness itself as it is the cognitive dissonance. It's supposed to be warm and pleasant outside, but instead you're bundled up in a coat and sometimes you don't see the sun for a week because of the fog. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If anything it's more than it's consistently cold. Plus, well, once you get down to a certain level it's hard to get much worse without turning scary cold to the degree that you're afraid of going outside. There's a lot less difference in how it feels between 32 and 55 compared to 55 and 72. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, and I hate cold weather. I like it to be closer to the 80s most of the time. I should be able to wear shorts all the time. Instead my shorts just sit in the dresser all year mocking me.

      Well, before I moved recently I had no control over the climate. The thermostat was in our neighbor's portion of the house. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now our bedroom is just rather drafty due to really old windows in there that keep out neither wind nor noise. Like last week when some people next door (not the next apartment, but another building) had a rather loud party. I asked them to please keep it down after my girlfriend went to bed at 1 AM or so, but sadly more drastic responses were needed in the end. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Amusingly related was how as I was returning from asking them to be a bit quieter someone drunk decided to piss on my girlfriend. Or more appropriately, at her. As she reports it she heard a rain-like noise and opened the window shade to find a dude with his rad chillies in hand micturating upon the window from above her (our place is just below ground level in back where there is a parking lot). Apparently he didn't realize it was a window. Still doesn't excuse pissing on someone's house when you're standing right next to a party. I was a bit upset that she didn't make a disparaging remark about his wang, but he was apparently embarrassed regardless.

      Yeah. It's kind of below ground level though. There's one of those little concrete retaining walls and a small ditch then the window so I don't think he knew it was a window at all. Just a building. I mean, despite it obviously being a window and having bars on it and everything. <br/>

      70s are not really common. It still feels like 60s. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd say that it feels like late Autumn year-round getting significantly colder as the sun sets even on warmer days. Nights, even on warm days, are always cold. Restaurants with outdoor seating normally have heaters because otherwise nobody would sit there at night ever. No warm, pleasant summer nights at all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're a sick deviant. I need 70s to 80s and even when I've been in the middle of say, a mid-summer Kansas heat-wave in the 100s I haven't had a real problem with it. Yeah, it's hot, but you have air conditioning and it's not a big deal. Better it be blazingly hot than slightly chill. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, at least it's never really cold and we don't ever have that horror of horrors...  <em>snow</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
On a warm day it is beautiful and amazing and you love that it's warm and sunny in the middle of winter. But then you get a cold, foggy summer where you just see grey skies all week and it's in the low 50s with a lot of bitter, damp wind and you start to believe that there must be a god because he obviously hates you.

      San Francisco in the summer is quite cold, at least subjectively, but it's really easy to get somewhere toasty on the weekend if you want.  In the middle of July you can get on BART in the city at 59 degrees and get off in the east bay at 105 degrees.  That's kind of fun.

      Laramie in this case. True though, I was coming along I-80 and it was hellish. Then again, I'm a different sort of person. I loathe rural areas and the outdoors. I cannot understand why a person would seek to leave the city for basically any reason. <br/>

Elk, now that I would like to get in my mouth. That is, if I want to get Chronic Wasting Disease. Prion disease for the fail. <br/>

      Agreed. I mean, below 0 I'm used to. Kansas could get rather chilly with a lot of wind, but that is truly insane. <br/>

We're having a warm period right now and breaking record highs. Monday I believe it was supposed to reach 70. It's been at least high 60s all week. Still, it's abnormal. But at least it's possible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I understand though. My girlfriend spent most of late September through November up at Ft. McMurray in Alberta. Working the night shift at the oil sands. <br/>

      According to wikipedia, it does actually stand for "Hockey": <br/>

      Funny how I disagree. <br/>

The only thing that may be more awesome was Cory Stillman's overtime goal in Game 6 in 2006 (not that it was that awesome of a goal, but...you know).  Oh, and I bet you guys are happy that Erik Cole got traded to Western Conference, huh?  21 points in 20 games vs the Habs? <br/>

      Useless? I think all my clothes and toys for my first three or four years in America were from garage sales. They were perfectly fine. The only thing was that I never got to have a full matching set of Ninja Turtles. I had to assemble a team out of Head Droppin' Raphael, Samurai Leonardo, Sewer Surfin' Michaelangelo, and Storage Shell Donatello, which forced me to come up with extremely convoluted and improbable playtime scenarios.

      As an only child I never had any hand-me-downs. Actually, I also never got rid of any clothes because my mother wouldn't (and still won't) let me. Over time my dresser became full during elementary school and then my chest of drawers filled during middle school until my closet was filled during high school and if I hadn't moved out for college I'd probably have completely run out of space. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My mother has absolutely no ability to throw things away. I mean, I don't want kids and I was both an only child and the only person in the family even remotely around. There is no reason to have an entire dresser full of old clothes that will never be worn again.

      Several actually. Plus my merit badge sash, handbook, shorts, neckerchiefs, etc. I have a whole drawer devoted largely to Boy Scout clothing and ephemera. At least, I did last I checked. My mother was a very active Cub Scout Den Mother, my father was somehow roped into two or so years as our Webelos leader and I spent a number of years in scouts until early high school. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Scout camp was great. Largely an excuse to play AD&D and Magic: The Gathering. I learned about a lot of geek culture through scouting and no camping trip was really complete without at least one RPG. Hell, it's the only reason I ever played Twilight: 2000. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Today I strongly disagree with the ideals behind much of scouting and if not the scouts personally then the leadership due to their policy of discrimination. If I had actually made Eagle (it's complicated, but basically I was never given leadership positions despite having training for them due to political reasons that kept people in them for lengthy periods of time... I believe I had enough badges to qualify for Life when I left, but not the leadership requirement) I would have returned it in protest. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember one incident at camp where I was told that only way I was getting out of going to church on Sunday was if I was an atheist. I avoided pressing the issue because I was familiar with the court case that was happening around that time. I feel a bit bad now for not telling them that that was precisely the reason I didn't want to go. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A number of my friends from my hometown were in as well, but none of them in my troop. I'd say that about half of my male friends from that group are Eagle.

      True, but I also wanted to spur debate about the exclusionary policies of Scouting International (or is it just the BSA that's causing the problem and other countries are cool?) towards atheists and homosexuals. Specifically that they claim that both are fundamentally immoral and at odds with the values they want to impart. <br/>

Here I thought it was mainly about learning rope use (Dex., no modifier), fire building (Wis., -1), and survival (Int., no modifier). About camping and having fun at summer camp. Nope. It's about being a dick and trying to force your conservative mindset on others. <br/>

      1) It was just a sampling <br/> 
2)2nd edition only please. Nothing exists after 2nd edition. Just a clear area that forces you to use minis all the damn time for the freakishly overcomplicated combat system with its crazy stupid powers for everyone and idiotic system of multi-classing. A fighter does not get special powers. He just has better THAC0 so he can actually hit people and more hit points. That is the proper way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Personally I've come to greatly prefer skill-based games like GURPS over class-based ones. The problem arises, of course, when you want to do things like magic that aren't best handled as just a skill or some classes that maybe should have unique powers that don't translate well into skills. Not to mention how different classes should maybe advance in different non-skill areas (e.g. hit points, to hit) at different rates. Still, I think the flexibility is generally worth it as long as you have a competent GM and players. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The other issue, for me, is whether you should only advance in skills as you use them (hard to level up less commonly used skills like maybe healing spells or such that are crucial, but not used as often as perhaps combat skills) or an allocated experience based skill system (less realistic? requires more work tracking experience and such).

      Been playing at 2nd and 3 for now 10 years. While i liked the 2nd edition, my avicon can present. I prefer the 3rd a bit for the balancing, making most class worth playing. The clerc is not the designatd healing bitch, the thief can survive (but not for long) etc. You can just tweak the game a bit. I'm currently the DM of a game, we've got 2 players (i play the cleric/mage, but i got only supportive, restorative magic on. They do the hero, i do the background). I keep the xp they won to myself, and when i fugure they have learned enough i make them lvl up. If they used their skill a bit, they put the point, but if they didn't (like crafting) they  most train a few days or week to get the increase

      Just give it a chance Belgand, It is different, but with a bit of imagination you can do wonders. Lately i've invited former DnD friends, but they play the enemies, i give them ressource (boss, minions, "lair" and so on) and the basic knowledge of the heroes, who goes increasing since they start getting know (popularity system from BG2).

      Nope. I played a game of 3rd a while back. The entire session was combat. Just moving around minis because you have to take distance and facing into account so much more now, using special powers and attacks and other nonsense. They're trying to turn it more into MMORPG combat and I hates it. If you want to do cool special attacks in combat you have to come up with them on your own and have the DM do it as a spot ruling. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And this switching to prestige classes nonsense? No. Just no. You pick a class and stay with it. Maybe you multi-class a bit, but that's it. Kits? OK, but none of these millions of classes nonsense. Fighter, Mage, Thief, Cleric. Paladin, Ranger, and Bard too, maybe magic specialization or such (which is more about playing style and spell selection), but that's it. Psionicists is even pushing it a bit for me.

      I can't see why it would be MMORPG style combat. It simply takes mobility much more into account, wich is helpfull for many classes. Prestige classes are mostly to do extremly specialised character. Remove them if they don't fit you. Frankly, ionly know a buch of prestige class that are better than the base class. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, feats is really the thing. It allows a fair bit of customisation. a 2nd edition fighter would specialize in a weapon, wear a full plate then hack away... Not many way to be imaginative.

      The imagination was in the player. I find feats ruin the game. From what I've seen of 4th edition rules they just expanded the whole concept and now it's all about powers and daily powers and at-will powers and all sorts of nonsense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It feels like it wants to be a computer game. You don't need everything codified. When I asked it I could have my ninja do a spin kick to take out multiple foes it was the DM just doing a quick ruling on the spot that resolved it, not a detailed work out of whether I had that feat yet, was close enough, etc. No shuffling papers or dicking around, just "Make a Dex -2 roll to pull it off and -5 to THAC0 on each enemy." You kept track of where people were in terms that were rough, but worked well enough to keep it from becoming a mini game. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It felt cooler because it was you, not just pulling some feat off your sheet. A good DM should have no problem at all making whatever you want happen with only a few checks and some creativity.

      I don't understand your point. Most of the feat make you more proficient in doing a certain action. If a character want to disarm is opponent, he can do it, he don't need a feat or anything. If he want a fencer whose classic move is this, well he should take it so to be better than other character at it. Zone of effect was a nightmare in 2nd edition, especially with spell like lightning bolt or fireball. . Quite often they find move that arent in the book, so i quick rule appropriatly. If he find a gaping flaw in my setup, hell he can use it, he found it. If he look for some random amulet, he can ask a mage or priest to de a locate object spell. Fuck me, i did not think about it, you win .   Without creativity and strategy they get crushed pretty fast

      Zone of Effect was only a problem if you let it be a problem. The best way of dealing with those things was to not worry about them too much. Play it loose and fun rather than getting bogged down in the details. Did he shoot a fireball at some dudes? Were they reasonably close to each other? It hit them. Was one of the dudes on the other side of the room? Was it a big room? He probably lost his eyebrows (if he rolls his save he was able to turn aside quickly enough with a loud expletive in order to keep one of them), but is otherwise fine. See? Easy! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Did we need a 3rd edition? Definitely. There was tons and tons of errata and various rulings and such over the years. The change in THAC0 to a sane positive number was a simple and reasonable change. But it should have been left light and simple. Too many rules create problems and leads to rules lawyering. <br/>

      But, it maybe me, but i don't mind a good set of rule if they are easy to remember. 3rd edition goes for a simple principe, the more competent your are, the bigger your modifier is high. The harder a task is, the harder the difficulty check is. RUles for the movement are kinda hard at first, and so are opportunity attack, but after a lil while you get the habit. Also, Strategy is much more proeminent. A good position and perception help a LOT. A good monk can go trough the enemy line with acrobatic, knock out the mage/sorcerer/archer in 1-2 round then get away before the big dudes. Mobile character are much more fun when you can see clearly your position and the enemies.

Although in another, truer way, no, not really. It means I have endless problems trying to get a game together and the whole industry is changed into a form I dislike. I can agree that we disagree on how things work best, but it's not something I can just ignore easily and keep on playing. All the groups are basically into 4th these days.

      Not, i maintain a healthy 3.5 edition game. We pretty much did everything there was to do with the 2nd, then got ahead when 3rd started. Right now  i have a complete campaign from lvl 1 to lvl 22 ready, with a few epic quest ready if they want to try it out. Seriously, much more way are opened wit the 3rd edition. Fuck 4th edition, it's good for 13 years old otherkin that want to play a dragon

      I'm not happy with Wizards at all. Yes, TSR made some very dumb moves, but they didn't fuck with it nearly as much nor did they basically take over the entire fucking industry to the same degree. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3rd edition Shadowrun was still good, but what I've read of 4th just sounds awful. Mainly the way they elminated decks and made decking entirely wireless so they go along inside more often on the run. Yeah, it was a pain in the ass running deckers on missions before, but this is just... this is not the right way to fuck with my favorite archetype.

      It feels like Wizards killed off or helped kill off all the smaller companies (yes, D20 allowed even smaller companies to flourish, but not in the same way, they're selling accessories, not competition). No more FASA, WEG, GDW, etc. Now it's mainly just WotC, Steve Jackson, Palladium (too crazy to die), Chaosium and... hmm... are White Wolf still going? Plus a smattering of even smaller companies.

      True and I would never want to imply that. My statement was that in each case a sexual interest is often implied by outsiders be it gay or straight. <br/>

In this case, well, it is the cause for a lot of the baseless speculation. Just how a lot of people will make similar speculations about Scoutmasters today (although not as much as they did in the 90s after that highly publicized molestation trial).

      You have missed a fine distinction. There are people who go to garage sales  <em>before they are scheduled to begin.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Middle-of-the-day garage sale patrons run the gamut from young families who kill two birds with one stone by getting bargains AND not spending money on real entertainment on a saturday afternoon, to the hipster types looking for retro decor. People who roll around residential areas in cars older than they are in the wee hours of the morning looking for garage sales are not what you would call normal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It does not matter what you do, they will find you. You can put up signs, you can park your friend's van diagonally across your driveway to try to block the view from the street, but they will squeeze between the front bumper and your alley fence to finger your musty assortment of wares, hoping to get the "good" stuff before the recently retired couples who don't have a routine down meander in.

      I haven't played in too long.  I think last time was when I still lived in the city.  One time after I'd been out here for a while, I was playing with some kids I met from my street and I had to explain why a tennis ball works better.  They thought a handball would work as well and first hit, we lost it in someone's backyard (in the city that would be no problem because no grass would obstruct our search and the yards were about 20 feet square anyway). <br/>

      There was no where else to play, unless we wanted to trek to a park, and if we were gonna do that, we might as well have scrounged up 18 players and gotten real bats and balls, and we didn't want to do that because 3 months of the year we played Little League ball anyway. <br/>

If your backyard is an acre, the street is probably not busy anyway.  If you don't have a backyard to play in, the street is probably hella busy.  Such is the conflict I faced in my youth.

      I think they skipped that slogan because too many people would laugh uncontrollably at it. I know I would chuckle. It'd be just like that anti-meth commercial that played back in the nineties, the one with the really catchy song. "I can't sleep... I can't eat... but I've got the cleanest house on the street!

      It might be true, but there are plenty of us that are not happy with it and want a move back to having our money backed by precious metals. <br/>

True, that's also a massive illusion, but it's a slightly more stable illusion and is more universal. <br/>

      Backed currency seems like a good idea especially now, but I can't quite wrap my head around this: wouldn't going back to it severely limit our ability to conduct international trade unless every other country adopted it as well?

      Well at the outset you would agree on a given value for gold, so that the gold we did have was equivalent to the amount of money in circulation. The whole point is that it would prevent inflation on the national level. But like I said, I have no idea how it would work in a global economy, that's what I want someone to explain to me.

      Here's the thing I have never understood about the gold standard:  How does the money supply grow to reflect the increases in value that occur through innovation?  If the money supply does not grow as value is created, there is risk of deflation, which is very bad, worse than inflation from what I understand.  Value is not mined out of the ground, it exists in and is created by people's minds.  So one goal of the central bank is to ensure that the money supply grows to accommodate value that is created.  I ASSUME (knowing next to nothing about banking) that they do this in part by allowing a modest rate of inflation.  That would tell them that they are actually adding too much money to the economy, but since there is no way to know the exact amount of money to add, and modest inflation is the lesser evil, that's what they do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So a gold standard or some other commodity backing of the currency would seem to be pointless for enabling the necessary growth in the money supply.  I suspect that the people who are hell-bent on the gold standard may have an answer for that, but I don't know what it is.  I have kind of regarded those people as cranks.

      I don't know quite enough about it, but I still regard inflation as a bad thing. Especially since salaries often do not rise in accordance with inflation. It benefits people at the top and who are in control of the financial industry much more, it would seem, than anyone else. <br/>

Actually, a friend posted the following from  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413120549/https://www.mises.org/books/inflation.pdf">What You Should Know About Inflation</a>  by Henry Hazlitt <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Today the method is a little more indirect. Our government sells its bonds or other IOUs to the banks. In payment, the banks create "deposits" on their books against which the government can draw. A bank in turn may sell its government IOUs to the Federal Reserve Bank, which pays for them either by creating a deposit credit or having more Federal Reserve notes printed and paying them out. This is how money is manufactured.<br/>
<br/>
The greater part of the "money supply" of this country is represented not by hand-to-hand currency but by bank deposits which are drawn against by checks. Hence when most economists measure our money supply they add demand deposits (and now frequently, also, time deposits) to currency outside of banks to get the total. The total of money and credit so measured was $63.3 billion at the end of December 1939, and $308.8 billion at the end of December 1963. This increase of 388% in the supply of money is overwhelmingly the reason why wholesale prices rose 138% in the same period.</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I haven't read it entirely for myself, but I do find something published by D. Van Nostrand (Dr. Van Nostrand?!?) to worry me. It's from 1960 though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end, however, it seems more logical that inflation is generally bad because it tends to help those who deal with the money first (banks, large corporations, the financial industry, the government) and hurts those who deal with it last (workers, the poor). Prices tend to rise more rapidly than wages do and at the lowest levels wages rise even more slowly. Minimum wage laws almost never keep pace with inflation... at least at the federal level, some states and municipalities have laws that do keep pace or try to account for areas with higher costs of living. Locally our minimum wage is the second-highest in the nation (behind Santa Fe, NM) and is linked to the Consumer Price Index. This year it goes up to $9.79. If you have more than 20 employees you also have to pay for health insurance. It's complicated, but there's a city fund for it and such and basically it means a lot of restaurants now have little notes saying how they'll be charging you 8% more on your bill because you voted for it and they fucking hate you now... including the high-end places that probably clear a good profit and were most likely just dicking over employees. Still, would you expect otherwise from a city that has both a high cost of living, increasing gentrification, and (often) very liberal politics? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, increasing value due to innovation? WTF? This is not something that is making any sort of sense to me. Please explain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Constant inflation seems untenable to me and a generally bad idea. I would think that keeping things more or less stable is the better idea. Inflation also seems to encourage a "buy it now even if you have to accrue debt to do so" sort of attitude that is very problematic and got us into all this trouble now. We should encourage people to save money reasonably and live within their means.

      Inflation has to do with too much money chasing too little value.  The usual way that happens is that too much money is printed.  Deflation is what happens when too little money is chasing too much value.  I am given to understand that the latter is worse than the former, within reason.  I am trying to help you understand that "value" is difficult to define and changes constantly for reasons that are not always apparent.  Stop concerning yourself with the minimum wage, which doesn't have anything to do with anything, except making it hard for the least productive workers to find honest employment.

      My point is that people who make less money are generally hurt far more by inflation. Wages tend not to keep pace with inflation nearly as much the further you go down the line. Even into the middle class inflation often takes a lot longer to affect wages than it does to increase prices.

      Dave, the amount of gold is not a fixed constant. It would still be mined, refined, stored, etc. So it would still allow for the sort of necessary consistent inflation that you speak of. In fact, if too much gold was mined, it could lead to overinflation. But the point is that it would still provide a tangible standard against which to measure this, as opposed to having uncontrolled inflation based on speculation and interest rates upon interest rates. At least that's my understanding. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I didn't mean to defend the gold standard - I just had a question that Wikipedia had no answer for. I guess I'll just have to go back to college and major in economics.

      I take your point, but that method seems just as arbitrary as what's being done now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Speculation" is just a scare word. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is a school of thought within the Federal Reserve, by the way (championed years ago by the president of the Dallas bank, I believe, and maybe completely out of fashion by now) that the Fed should not set interest rates at all, only the money supply, and let the interest rates come from the market (auctions of the money, basically.)  Paul Volcker won out against this process way back when.  Maybe read about Volcker on Wiki and it will lead to a description. <br/>

      Can't inflation happen even without the government printing too much money? A great deal of the money in circulation exists only in a virtual sense. So what happens when you have billions of virtual dollars being invested in ways that supposedly add value, but actually don't? This is what happened with credit default swaps. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But yea, I'm also not sure what method they use to determine how much gold to produce. I think the point is just that it would provide a steady gradual increase as opposed to cycling between extremes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yea, I also wish I knew more Econ. I know someone who majored in it, but she mostly knows micro, which is basically pure mathematical analysis.

 For a good primer on making money the old fashioned way, I recommend To Live and Die in L.A. Doesn't show the exact composition of the paper, iirc, but it's still a hoot of stylin' and a young Willem Dafoe.

      Sure, man. <br/>

 <strong>1.</strong>  Bending over and shitting on a railroad track in the dead of Winter is much easier after drinking eleven pale lagers and one rum and Coke which you found sitting untouched on the tank of the toilet you were using earlier at the bar. It is so easy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>2.</strong>  Like it or not, blue jeans are the reason that everybody in the world basically looks like shit all the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>3.</strong>  Pieces of French toast were meant to be used in the manner of sandwich slices. Throw some bacon and sriracha between those fuckers, dude. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>4.</strong>  Calling attention to the fact that one doesn't get enough chubbies on Assetbar will do nothing to increase the amount of chubbies one gets on Assetbar. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>5.</strong>  Running to catch an early bus is the lowest most of us will ever sink. It's pathetic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
and <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>6.</strong>  The average adult female can survive for over four months eating only pages from the O.E.D. Add the covers and the glue and you're looking at up to six months of hot, wet, hardcore survival.

      Alright, everyone. What I mean with Fact No. 2 is not so much that people look bad in jeans. Almost everyone wears them and some of them look decent or even OK. What I'm saying is that the rise of jeans in world culture marked a corresponding decline in fashion overall. Down the years, folks have adapted and made the best of it. And yes, some peoples' asses look hot in them. But jeans are basically at the root of why people no longer where bowler hats and ties to baseball games anymore. That's just one example, but it kind encapsulates what I'm talking about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
First came jeans, then sweat shirts, then jean shorts and white sneakers and then everyone everywhere looked like shit. The end.

      In that first picture there she looks better, true, but her face and body are clearly different colors. That's not right. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Regardless she's not my type. I probably wouldn't give her a second look. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While it's overpriced I think part of it is because of some craziness about her being a virgin. I don't understand the point though. I'd rather have sex with a girl who knows what she's doing. Well, but still young enough to have some youthful enthusiasm and curiosity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For $3.7 million you'd be better off just funding some porn where you could not only have sex legally with a good number of women for a lot less, but you'd also be able to sell it and make even more money... that could then be turned around for more of the same.

This strip is disappointing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's pretty much a repeat of a previous concept (Teodor sells unlikely things to silly people in a last ditch effort to pay the rent). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roast Beef is completely out of character. When did he turn into a hard ass, no nonsense salesman? <br/> 
 <br/> 
The dialogue is nonsensical for the most part, no jokes really. <br/>

      Okay, some of the best strips have been "repeats" of previous concepts. The Saddest Thing? Ray OKing a really stupid invention? Todd ruining his life? <br/> 
 <br/> 
And Beef isn't out of character. He needs to help get rent money, and he has dealt with stupid tweakers his entire life. He knows that you can't talk to them for long periods of time (nor should you want to), so he hurries them away before they ruin anything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The jokes are in the various characters of each tweaker. I mean, the tax-form guy calls Teodor an amateur -- insinuating that he is a frequenter of garage sales...and that there are people in the world who are considered skillfull and experienced garage vendors. That is a joke. I laughed. <br/> <br/> <br/> Still, despite the total whiffs in your commentary, you don't deserve lames. People are entitled to have opinions. Anyone who lames you is an overly opinionated charlatan.

      When I was 6 years old, my family and my best friend's family held a garage sale. The owner of a nearby candy store, Sugar Mountain, wanted to purchase a Lite-Brite to make a sign for his store's window. He offered the adults a free Slush Puppy for each of the five children present in exchange for the ware, which we greatly enjoyed. Two weeks later, the store was out of business. I have never forgiven myself.

      Hurray!  I am glad to read this fine production!  BTW, I said "is it starting to suck." not "this sucks"  This was a few days ago and goodness, so much seriousness!

      I know a real M&M person. <br/>

At my office's secret Santa exchange, a middle-aged woman who sits at a nearby cubicle received a plastic statuette of a red anthropomorphic M&M and a yellow anthropomorphic peanut M&M sassily leaning on a race car plastered with M&M logos. Amazingly, she reacted with enthusiasm that seemed genuine: "Oh, you knew I collect M&Ms! Thank you so much!" <br/>

      So begins the Great Achewood Hiatus.  I'll stick around for a few days then probably disappear until next comic; this helpfully coincides with the start of second semester so I won't be distracted immediately.

      Yeah, it kinda sucks now that it's happened.  (see above) <br/>

The idea was fraught with potential for someone to find something funny, and the person they are using as their fetish story incarnation won't find it as funny.  I mean, the danger of it all going awry was kinda what made the idea exciting.  But the person being lampooned totally has the right to pull the plug on it when it goes too far in their minds, if ya ask me. <br/>

      What the  <em>fuck,</em>  people?! I was actually proud of that last piece! If you were going to get incensed about either of the two it seemed like the first one was much more asinine. And, GH - what are you talking about "dead-insect-jerk-off stories?" I don't remember any dead insects in either of my posts. Or did a third one appear which I didn't get to see? <br/>

The cauliflower penis picture or the insect jizz eating? <br/> 
 <br/> 
TGH, I question your logic of a picture of someone's medically messed-up, warty knob (which is a hard thing to get out of your head) being categorically less offensive than a story of jacking off on a dead insect and then eating said concoction. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Surely you can stop reading half-way through and be on your merry way, something you cannot do with a picture of someone's warty knob.

      The point was to get you guys to stop posting there, by posting something so offensive and shocking no one could top it. <br/>

And I was beat by insect-jizz eating porn.

      You could have just asked us to stop posting there, if it pissed you off that much (it could be argued that the social situation would have resulted in this tack not actually working). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I read the insect-jizz eating porn just in time - it was gross, no doubt, but I'd rather read it twenty times than see that picture once.  I was a particular fan of the sentence "the roach's soul blessed mine in panvertebrate sexual gastronomy". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I found it a clever commentary on our times and the situation at hand  <em><strong>and yeah ok I wrote it.</strong></em>   The whole defense up there was just for funsies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah, it was gross.  It came about by reading the previous posts and wanting to crank it up to that level of "HOLY FUCK MY EYES ARE BLEEDING" - I first thought of bestiality, but that's too obvious, so I thought and thought and when I found something that disturbed me I ran with it, and then I added in some intimacy and pseudo-spiritual connotations which are always a sure-fire to make it that much more unsettling.  I was disturbed, so I considered it a success. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Disturbing slash fiction was pretty much the point, I thought, and I figured you were up with playing along - apparently I was incorrect, so I totally respect that you pulled the plug on it when you felt the line had been crossed for you and how you're feeling and whatever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That all having been said, it wasn't  <em>that</em>  gross.  I mean, well yeah actually it was, but wasn't that the point of it all? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now let's put all this silliness behind us.  I think we all grew from the experience, now shut up everyone.

      This is a great strip -- it's good to see some quality material during this dearth! <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, while I'm sympathetic to Chris' ordeals, I have to take issue with his reasons for not producing the strip as often. A move is one thing, and nobody is going to suggest that he not focus on his family, but to say that the strip isn't being produced so that product orders can be fulfilled, and premium content can be delivered, is angering. The answer to that situation, in my view, is not less of the main content; it's less of the premium content and longer shipping times.

      The thing is, as fucked up as it seems, that's where the money is for him.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is not some weekend thing he does in college  <em>this is his career</em> . He has to keep the income flow coming or else buyers will not buy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also I don't think he was stating outright that that was one of the main reasons he's not producing more strips for a couple of weeks (seriously guys it's only two weeks or so, not months or years). He said that more to reassure customers that are actually PAYING for content that they will get what he paid for, because as stated above, this is a BUSINESS. <br/>

The point I was trying to make was that Chris doesn't have a side job, his job is making this comic for us. And believe it or not, us simply viewing this comic probably doesn't pay the bills for him.

      Yes, and my point was that his business practices and material needs are of no concern to me. As a fan of his  <em>comic</em> , all I care about is the finished artistic product, which there has been less and less of. It would probably be even more profitable for him and his family to quit doing the comic altogether and go to law school, but that doesn't mean that we as fans would have to appreciate and support that decision.

      I'm grateful to have four great strips in a row. I can handle getting them sporadically. It was nice of Onstad to blow our minds with nearly perfect comic strips every couple of days, absolutely free, for years. Now he's slowed down. Maybe it's for the best: these last few strips have been stellar. <br/>

On the other hand, elbox has a point about... <br/>

      In elbox's defense Penny Arcade is able to not only produce three strips a week (including when they're traveling or going to conventions or such) consistently for years, but they also both make a living off of it, do other projects, support a staff and families, and manage a charity and an annual convention. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Does PA require quite as much work as Achewood? I doubt it. Even though it is colored and such the jokes are generally more topical and related to an area with cycling content to discuss, the writing is not as sharp or literary, and the format means only 9 panels a week where Mr. Onstad will often spend that on a single strip in recent times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the same time Achewood doesn't have ads, a business manager, outside work in related industries, or nearly the same size of fanbase. Chris also labors over these jokes. He doesn't just talk to his friend while playing video games and reading gaming news until he comes up with a good idea (as we've seen in the podcasts). <br/> 
 <br/> 
My point is that it is most definitely possible. Not only possible, but they do it without much in the way of a lead given how it is topical.

      That wasn't directed at you specifically. I've just heard several other people make the ridiculous argument that they'd rather pay $3 a month than look at an ad banner. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for Penny Arcade, about all they do in terms of commercialism is take banner ads, and even then, I remember reading that they pick and choose which ads to run. That is, they actually won't run ads for a game that they think is shitty. As for the promo strips they do, those are on a separate section of the site, unrelated to the main strip.

      I agree.  I wouldn't be opposed to ads, especially if it will ensure the continuation of the strip.  And if it doesn't really slow down the site.  On the main achewood page, it shouldn't.

      Exactly. They agree to do outside work. They post it on the site because they think (correctly) that their fans would be interested in it. It's just work-for-hire really that's going to be used to promote the game. It's not like Tycho is being paid to push products in his posts or give favorable reviews or that they do product-placement in the strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It would be like if any other artist did, say, album art. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not saying that Achewood should be like PA, I'm not saying it would even be possible. I'm just saying that they do manage to run a business plus other ventures and still put out strips three times a week consistently even when they're traveling or otherwise not able to do it in their normal, topical fashion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is possible is what I'm saying. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad wants to do, say, more work for the New Yorker? I think that would be awesome if it helps him bring in more money and allow him more time to focus on the strip as opposed to business. I think it's closer to what PA does with their promo strips, but for Achewood.

      I'd certainly agree. I tried to make that consistently obvious. I was just saying that you  <em>can</em>  make a solid income from comics supporting even more people and still not have any problems producing on a regular schedule without even breaks that most people would probably OK with.

      The argument I'm trying to make is that Gabe and Tycho just happen to do comics making jokes for a well-established medium that earns a shit ton of money. The more niche comics (like Achewood and a few of my other favorites that I won't mention here) have a harder time breaking out. Granted, like Perry Bible Fellowship before him, Onstad has found a way to the surface but I sincerely doubt that it's been enough that he can alienate paying customers or cut out that aspect altogether. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's the nature of the beast, TBH.

      I haven't followed Goats in a long time either, but it seems to do fairly well and I know it used to update regularly the last time I followed it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dinosaur Comics, Wigu, Diesel Sweeties, and Scary-Go-Round are all popular, but fringe as well and they make plenty of money on t-shirt sales without seriously impacting production. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Honestly the main reason I mentioned PA is because they run a very good business and they almost never, ever miss a strip.

      Sometimes it feels like Onstad is alienating those fans who don't subscribe to the premium.  Sometimes.  I understand that $3 is not a lot, but I have to prioritize my expenses.  It sucks being in Grad School.  Sometimes.  At the same time, I have no complaints about the irregularity of the strip.  I just want the pay content without paying.  That's just me.  Sometimes.

      I'm a little surprised, however, that Chris hasn't commissioned some guest strips. They weren't THAT bad last time around. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe he could have gotten some commentors to post some of those photoshopped strips. I'd LOVE to see Achewire, Ghostwood, or whatever else people could come up with.

      I love most of the Assetbar-produced Achewood mock-ups (especially the one which I have reposted below, which I think should stand tall among the greatest real Achewood strips of all time), so no one take offense, but I think the place for those really is down here. There's something to be said for the integrity of the archives, and I think it may start getting dicey if too many of these (even the very good ones, of which there are many) were to be posted as actual strips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And don't even get me started on the guest strips. I understand that there may be some consideration for comic artist community solidarity or something, but seriously - 90% of those were fucking awful and you  <em>know</em>  it. I would rather the archives be a little thin than to have them be fat with that tripe. <br/>

      I'm sure there are free ones too, but the site wouldn't have its own URL though.  I wouldn't be too opposed to this.  I might start one if I knew a little bit more about HTML and CSS and stuff.  It actually seems like a good project. I am going to take a class about the internet this coming semester, and we are learning these languages.  I don't know if we have to design a site for our project, but this sounds like a good one.

      Not to be a douche but how is  <em>The Matrix</em>  anymore important than say,  <em>Pulp Fiction</em>  or  <em>Reservoir Dogs</em>  or even the Kill Bill series?  <br/>

      That wasn't the  <em>plot</em>  of the Matrix, though, that was a  <em>theme</em>  in the Matrix. The  <em>plot</em>  was about crazy robots drinking our life force. And yes, while the  <em>themes</em>  in both the Matrix and Quentin Tarantino's films may have been done before (Don't you know that there's nothing new left under the sun to write?) their style is, to my inexperienced eye, very original. <br/>

      Your mother is a very nice person, Pogo. I think wath make hr so special are the attention to little thing, and her caring nature. LIke most "model" mother she is ok with making the food for the familly, tidying the house, taking care of the lunches,etc. But not all mother would prepare a ploom cupcake who is both delicious and good for your gastric tracts (a mother know). A normal mother will go get her kid at the bar, totally hammered on Vodka-RedBull at 3 in the morning, but your would make you a bed breakfast just to be sure you can recover faster. She also do that marvelous thing with her tongue.These are only a few examples on tip of my hat.

      I would have to agree. Rocking the French can or even the German or Italian cans are probably a lot more fun. I mean, while the English can is likely to be pale and beautiful it's also likely to be pretty lumpy. We won't even deal with rocking the American English can. <br/> 
 <br/> 
English ladies can be astoundingly hot and the accent certainly only sweetens the deal, but the can of the language? No way man. No way.

      Jonah Hill is really only good in small doses. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He was awesome in Walk Hard but I felt he detracted from Superbad, and he was decent in Knocked Up, which was really not that great of a film to begin with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All in all this was a fine start for him, and if he stuck with that deadpan delivery he would have been much better in the aforementioned films.

      I think if he toned it down a bit he would have contributed a bit more. Micheal Cera already is one of the chillest most awkward actors ever, and Jonah Hill's zany funny man act was almost too much of a polar opposite.

you still get these fucksticks that right 'em in the grocery store as well. they are so fucking "traditional" (old folks) or "stupid" (retards) that they think they still need to do this. that the banks very own check card (atm) will actually fuck up their check book balancing method. i mean.. wtf? how is the type of stupidity still in existence today?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i haven't balanced my checkbook in 15 years. NEVER had a single discrepency.

You all seem to know about really cool music and stuff, so I need your Opinions: <br/>

      London Calling. C'mon, I don't even listen to them and I know that. <br/>

(Also, I'm not just belching random, uninformed decisions. I have a friend who loves The Clash, and she regards it as the best album of all time.)

      Yes. It is regarded as one of the main albums of all times. Unless I'm mistaken Teodor even parodies it's iconic cover once. <br/>

You also need to get into the Dead Kennedys. Start with Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables.

      I can't listen to DK the way I used to. I still have a lot of respect for them and I'll always love Ray Pepperell's style, but their appeal just didn't really carry over into adulthood with me the way, say, Fugazi did. When I was sixteen I used to listen to  <em>Fresh Fruit</em>  at least once a day. Now I don't think I've heard it all the way through in a decade. There are still some individual songs which I'll always love ("Moon Over Marin" is pretty fucking timeless), but there's just no way that I'll ever live my life around them like I used to. <br/>

(GH, I am in no way hinting that you shouldn't seek out the Dead Kennedys. Please do. But start with The Clash, for sure.)

      Yes, London Calling.  It has a good diversity of musical styles, which I've found makes me more likely to listen to it end-to-end.  And in contrast to some other best-albums-ever, most of the songs are catchy and accessible.  London Calling isn't content to simply impress the listener with The Clash's expanding musical palette--an ambition that, all by itself, could have resulted in an album full of phoned-in reggae.  Nor is it content to impress the listener with the novelty (for the time) of being a double album in the world of punk rock--which could have led to a lot of boring filler tracks.  Instead, there are a lot of good songs that can stand on their own, as well as a few great songs.

      Funny you should mention it. A couple of days ago I decided to finally sit down and give  <em>Wind Waker</em>  a proper go. I'm fucking in love with it. Yeah, the fighting is kind of too easy, but that seems to be its only obvious flaw at this point. I see that  <em>Twilight Princess</em>  is supposed to be kind of the sequel to  <em>WW,</em>  and that they released a version for the Gamcube. This could be a Thing for me in the near future.

      Ocarina of Time didn't do it for me. That whole N64 era was basically made largely of really bad ideas. Especially ones relating to making good games into very ugly, blocky 3D games that the technology could barely handle for no legitimate reason other than shouting "IT'S 3D!!!". <br/> 
 <br/> 
Link to the Past is still the best game in the series. This is largely true of most major Nintendo franchises and the SNES. See also: Super Metroid, Super Mario World.

      You've said this before, and I told you that you should play Majora's Mask, which was better in every way and was the darkest, most interesting, and saddest of the Zelda games. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will have to say that after playing Twilight Princess, I can no longer confidently say that MM is my favorite. Twilight Princess is basically everything that Ocarina should have been, and then some. The combat alone puts it at the top - the sword skills you learn are fucking awesome, and did I mention HORSEBACK COMBAT? The part where you joust against the orc on the broken bridge was near orgasmic, and I'm not even going to get into the final battle. The overall atmosphere is still not as dark as Majora's Mask, but having Adult Link back, a complex storyline, and somewhat more mature dialogue after having to endure Wind Waker is a blessing. The whole wolf thing was not much in terms of gameplay, but it was beautiful aesthetically. And one of the best things that I hope they keep for later games is the way that a lot of the important fighting story-wise, and even some awesome boss battles happen outside the dungeons in the overworld, making the game much less linear and formulaic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So yea, go play it.

      Oh yea, and I hear the Gamecube version is actually superior to the Wii one. From YouTube videos I've seen, it looks like the aiming reticule is ridiculously picky, the camera controls are a mess, and then there's that whole thing about how they decided to make it for Wii at the last minute and had to mirror-flip the entire world when they realized that Link was left-handed.

      I played it through on the Cube Collection and didn't have any huge problems with it that I recall. First time I got all of the masks, actually. Protip: Don't run out of Bombchus in the fourth segment of the Moon dungeon. You will have to do all of that shit again.

      <em>Twilight Princess</em>  was great, and I get WHY you don't like  <em>Wind Waker</em>  but I don't really think it would apply to most people. It was very much a fairy tale-esque game and story, which fit the graphic style and dialogue, whereas  <em>Twilight Princess</em>  is more a myth or, dare I say,  <em>legend</em>  and deserved the darker tone. MM and OoT are the same way but in reverse (MM is more a dark fairy tale and OoT is more a lighthearted legend).

      Let's just get to the elephant in the room and acknowledge that the damn sailing was incredibly annoying and stupid and made the overworld a dull chore where you go from pointless island to pointless island instead of enjoying the overworld. Not to mention the triforce nonsense at the end. That took the worst aspect of the game and made it the entire game.

      I won't say that I exactly agree with you, but I will say that just last night I actually fell asleep sitting up while sailing. I  <em>did</em>  have a little buzz on and it  <em>was</em>  two in the morning, but yeah - it's probably not a good sign when you fall asleep during an action game. <br/>

That having been said, I will reassert that  <em>Wind Waker</em>  is filling me with joy right now. I haven't had so much fun with a nerdy sword game so much since  <em>Fable.</em>

      Before I got the ability to warp, I would set my course, eat breakfast, and come back 5 minutes later. I would leave the volume turned up in case I got attacked and knocked out of the boat, but if you were sailing with the wind, that usually wouldn't happen.

      Hey, while we're still talking about games, can someone tell me what was so great about Brave Fencer Musashi? People have made references to it on here, and all the reviews on GameFaqs were like "BEST ACTION RPG EVER", but all I see is awful puns, simplistic gameplay, and characters that consist of three polygons. I mean I know it's PS1, and I kind of missed out on that whole initial 3D era since I went right from a Sega Genesis to a PS2, but seriously, there are enemies that are just a sphere on top of a cube. I've played N64 games, and I've never seen anything this bad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So far I fought the first boss and did the first quest. The boss fight was okay, but it took me at least half an hour of throwing the dog and having it fall in the water to get just the right angle so that it lands on the other side of the river. Then I accidentally went a step too far while not holding the dog and I was back in the village, dogless. I just want to know if there is any reason I should continue to endure this buffoonery and that lascivious librarian's gay voice any longer.

      I still wouldn't have been happy with it, but yeah. That was definitely the case. Most of the islands were completely worthless. The bigger problem is that unlike previous games the overworld wasn't seemless with the underworld. You didn't really fight any enemies on the overworld unless you got off your boat. It actually took away my desire to explore because not only was it such a pain in the ass and incredibly dull, but there wouldn't be anything worth doing when I got there.

      I really don't mind it too much. To be honest, I kind of enjoy the downtime. See, I've been playing nothing but  <em>Animal Crossing, Rock Band 2</em>  and  <em>Harvest Moon</em>  for the past six months. After all that, even a game like this - in which even the really dangerous enemies are kind of cartoony and cute in a way - seems kinda really harrowing to me. Having a few pastoral minutes on the open seas with happy music in the air is kind of nice after fighting through a dungeon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In all honesty, my stress threshold when it comes to games is basically that of a 12-year-old girl at this point. I was always kind of a pussy, but  <em>Silent Hill</em>  ( <em>The Room,</em>  to be specific) pretty much took my spine from me and has not yet returned it.

      Thank you. Wind Waker is an unsung treasure which I am totally playing again when I get back to my beloved Gamecube. <br/>

That said, I would recommend that you don't get your hopes up with Phantom Hourglass. I know that quite a few people hailed it as the best Zelda in years, but in my opinion, pretty decent touch-screen use aside, it's very much Zelda Lite. No style nor substance to the thing.

      I used to not like the Clash and all my friends tried to make me like them.  It was indeed London Calling that finally turned me.  In particular the tune "Spanish Bombs."  Just give it a few listens and that album has a total creeper effect.

      That gap, much like the one on my resume, is because  <strong>I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A FUCKING JOB!!!!</strong> . The short-term jobs are because I was a goddamn college student and I only worked in the summers when I could find someone willing to hire me knowing that I'd only be there for the summer.

Being a wordsmith, I listened for the killer phrase that would be quoted forever, and couldn%u2019t find one. Now I%u2019m pouring over the transcript, and still the sound bite eludes me. Perhaps I should wait for the rest of the media to decide, but then, what good am I? <br/> 
 <br/> 
First, the tone and delivery: Obama spoke in long, multi-part paragraphs, rather than in sound bites. In that regard, much of the speech sounded stilted, and you seldom took your eyes off the teleprompters. That tells me these words were overwrought, and not the way you would really speak to us. <br/> 
Now the words themselves: Right away, a nice turn of phrase in the second graf, %u201CAmerica has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears.%u201D I like that he includes himself in %u201Cwe the people,%u201D that stirring and revolutionary phrase that began self-government and began the beheading of those who considered themselves too noble to obey common laws. <br/> 
Later he said that our time of %u201Cprotecting narrow interests%u201D has surely passed. Much better than continuing the beat the dead horse of %u201Cspecial interests,%u201D since all interests are special to someone, but it%u2019s those narrow interests that strangle and distort so much legislation. Broaden your interests, people! Stop voting based on one issue. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then he spoke on my favorite topic, economics: He dismissed the question of %u201Cwhether the market is a force for good or ill,%u201D and acknowledged that, %u201CIts power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched.%u201D But there%u2019s always the caveat that, %u201Cwithout a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control.%u201D I would add that without some humility and willingness to share, greed can make any market balloon out of control in a speculative frenzy. How to prevent that is a very good question. We%u2019re talking basic human nature here, it seems to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then the speech got tough, and as I was near our airport, it was symbolic that two flights of F-14 fighters did their takeoff and circling maneuver, their jet engines booming through the walls. %u201CWe will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense,%u201D he said, challenging the Islamic extremists who preach against the ways of the West and the equality of women. %u201CFor those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.%u201D I have already seen that last part quoted in a news story. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Two more quick comments, then I need to get back to my day job: I really liked the line, %u201Cwe have tasted the [bitter] swill of civil war and segregation.%u201D I think he skipped %u201Cbitter.%u201D Relating the civil war to segregation is a proper legacy for the former Confederate states. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And finally, something to ponder %u2013 what did he mean by %u201Cthe lines of tribe shall soon dissolve%u201D? I have spoken often of tribalism and how it must pass way on the journey to nationhood. Especially in Africa, but also in the Middle East %u2013 the former Iraqi leader was from the tribe of Tikrit, for instance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
With %u201Cfaith and determination,%u201D we will carry the journey of freedom and democracy onward. Amen to that, brothers and sisters. <br/>

      you guys <br/> <br/> <br/> i'm bored <br/> 
 <br/> 
lets talk about the song "Murder She Wrote" by Chaka Demus and Pliers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What do you guys think about that song?  I think it is pretty sweet, I like the grooves and the words.  Sometimes I think that song in my head, when I am doing other things, not neccesarily related to the song "Murder She Wrote" by Chaka Demus and Pliers.  Sometimes I wonder what it would be like for someone to cover that song.  Sometimes I wonder what it feels like to be a murderer.

      OK, so still no new comic to talk about. So I want to talk about this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Gran Torino. <br/> <br/> <br/> What. The Fuck. Was that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've never seen worse acting in a movie in my life. Eastwood wasn't bad -- but he was almost a static character. Everyone else in that movie was goddamn horrible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The parts which required actual shows of emotion? Incredibly fake and laughable. I actually could not stop laughing when the boy pretended (note I say pretended) to break down after being locked in the basement.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was like a high school video project done with some rich kid's dad's high quality camera and a lighting crew. Jesus Christ. <br/> <br/> <br/> Am I the only one revolted by the movie?

 <em>I had this really hot dream about you on Thursday morning. I woke up hungover and decided to take a shower to do something about the hangover and to do something about the dream.

I would think that the fapping would be a compliment, although to be honest, he probably shouldn't have told the girl he likes.

i thought the puking part was pretty funny. i don't know. i don't have a lot of experience "flirting" so it's weird when people say things to me and i'm weirded out but i'm not sure if i should be or if i'm the weird one and it's just such as a basic thing to say to a lady.

      Yeah, I'll definitely agree on the latter. If he wanted to go after bad musical taste he should have picked him listening to Creed or coming in wearing a Dave Matthews Band shirt. That would better complete the image. <br/>

I once worked with a guy who wore, so far as I could tell, nothing but Dave Matthews Band shirts. He scared me even though he was one of the few competent employees.

Sometimes I think that people on Assetbar are just trying to infuriate me. <br/> 
Okay, I can understand if you think sex is not inherently wrong.  But a girl who dresses that way is most likely doing it so that she can be viewed as an object, and guys would be more attracted by her looks than her personality, and a lot of sex increases the likelihood of pregnancy, STI's and emotional issues, especially if she is too young. <br/>

Sometimes fucking is just fucking. It's not always an expression of your deep love for each other. It's about pleasurable friction on your genitals with attractive people. <br/>

The thing is that it is a lot more likely that men will view her as a tramp and treat her accordingly.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, sex is sex, but I am speaking from a health stand point.  Pregnancy and STIs.  But most importantly, emotional health.  The girl may get emotionally attached to a boy who does not love her back.  Or perhaps the boy will feel attached to her, sees her sleeping around with other guys, and shoots someone in the face.  I don't know.  Maybe your daughter will be so ugly no one will even touch her, and she gets depressed that no one wants to have sex with her. She will also be viewed like a slut if she did have a lot of sex.  <br/> 
My point is that sex is a thing for mature people.  If mature people want casual sex, okay.  But a fifteen year old girl probably can't handle it. <br/> 
I'll say this: sex is a horrible thing.  I'm not speaking from a Christian viewpoint either.  Sex is largly resposible for depression, suicide, jealousy, rape, sexism, bullying, anxiety, self-esteem issues, guilt, and mistrust.  I'm not talking about the act itself, but the drive.  Humans are not animals, which are social idiots compared to humans; they can handle sex.  Humans can not.  If we were asexual, humanity would be a lot better off. <br/> 
Sex is enjoyable, sure, but there is a lot of pain involved as well.  And it is  <em>definitely</em>  not a beautiful thing.

      I hesitate to join in the snide ranks of those above me who think convention is its own justification. I just don't think it's really possible to argue this. If you are actually able to look at sex as purely physical and fun, untinged with any sort of guilt or degradation, that's great for you. As you yourself acknowledge, it's abnormal, though it's becoming less so. There's really no rational argument I can offer against that, as with many things relating to human emotions, especially where sexuality is concerned. All I can say is that from my standpoint, that association seems like something fundamental and intrinsic. And given that both me and sje are staunch atheists, you can't just dismiss it as the result of Christian morality. I was not raised with any sort of religious morals, nor did my mom try to instill any sort of shame in me. Perhaps if you psychoanalyzed me, you could find some deep-rooted justification, such as the fact that several girls I liked during my formative years turned out to be sluts who seemed to give it up to anyone other than myself. Regardless, the fact that I continue to feel this way despite my best efforts is justification enough for me.

      How is that creepy?  It's not really different than fapping to a girl while just thinking about her or fapping it while you're on the phone with her and she's talking about how she kept falling asleep during class today and you're just all like "Hey is it slutty to wear a bikini around the place I mean, not even at the beach" and she tells you and you're all trying to hold your breath and then when you let it all out you didn't open your throat quite enough and a weird sound comes out and you have to explain that it musta been just the phone can you hold on please I have to go to the bathroom.

      [i]I had this really hot dream about Sarah Palin on Tuesday morning. I woke up registered to vote and decided to go in the voting booth to do something about the election and to do something about the dream. But, when I went to do the deed in the voting booth, I discovered that I wasn't a Republican but a Democrat. Instead of voting for Sarah Palin, I wound up going on welfare and getting an abortion in the voting booth. I want you to know this is all Obama's fault.

      I think the part where "instead of wanking to thoughts of you I vomited all over myself" is what makes it a big problem. Not as bad as "so I  <em>intentionally</em>  vomited all over myself to aid in the self-pleasuring process because I'm into that sort of thing".

I've spent my entire life living in constant fear that if I so much as looked at a girl too directly, she would laugh in my face, call me a creep, and completely ruin my life forever by communicating my dreadful impropriety to every other girl in the vicinity via the secret telepathic link that all females share.

1.) The sporadic updating was a result of a tour. So that he could leverage this whole shindig into a livable income, so that he can keep dancing for our delight.  <br/> 
This comic is so good. It is the goodest. This comic's formula seems to be "there is a frame. This frame is better than frames drawn by other artists. Then they say something that is better than it is in life, or worse, but in a better way. Then there are characters you can identify with, and their actions are well conveyed." <br/>

I love Achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that Chris Onstad is a rad dude. He is a rad dude that lives a life. Every once in a while, drawing a comic is a part of that life. Every once in a while, it is funny. Every once in a while, it is not. Sometimes the comics are character-driven and specific. Sometimes the comics are drawn for the sake of a joke that is not related to the main characters at all. There have been weeks with multiple strips. There have been weeks with no strips. When I wake up and there is a new strip, I am happy. When I wake up and there is not a new strip, I go to work or kiss my fiance or play Fallout 3. I understand that Chris Onstad is a man with things to do. If he can supply me with a comic, I appreciate it. If he has not supplied me with a comic, I do not feel as though he has cheated me out of something that I am owed. When he does not meet a deadline, I do not get angry, because I often miss deadlines as well. Also, I often feel that Onstad sets deadlines only to placate those who are on the brink of nervous breakdown due to lack of new content. I am also confident that he attempts to meet the deadlines that he sets. I am also confident that he does not owe anything to anyone, so get over it. <br/>

      As long as they're happy, it's fine.  If you don't know what love is, you won't be unhappy about not being able to fall in love.  If you do not want to keep secrets (which the government almost succeeds in doing), then you won't feel unhappy about not being able to keep a journal. <br/>

      They weren't happy though, in  <em>1984</em> , even the people just going along with the motions weren't truly happy because they knew, vaguely, what it was like before. It's mentioned in the book. How do you not know that? <br/>

      sje46's grasp of the human condition leaves something to be desired, and it's this sort of moral relativism that often causes me to despair for generations to come. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Love is just scratching the surface. Everything,  <em>everything</em>  that makes humanity great is subverted and perverted in the societies of  <em>1984</em>  and  <em>Brave New World</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
One of the most powerful underlying themes of  <em>1984</em> , for example was the need of collectivist ideologies to ultimately destroy the personal bonds of families, friends and lovers because personal bonds mean personal ideals, personal loyalties, personal moral codes, personal ambitions... all of which undermine the State as Supreme Being. <br/>

And Orwell didn't just pull it all out of his ass, as anyone familiar with Antonio Gramasci's vileness would know.

      "Everything that makes humanity great"=all values that have served us well in order to create a happy life in this particular society.   <br/> 
I Think that the destruction of all these things that we value is worth it if we it will make us happy, which one can argue is the reason we have those things anyway, that is, if utilitarianism is correct. <br/> 
I don't know if it is correct.  The main thing that is bothering me is tha people just accept these societies as bad because, basically, it involves practices that we have been conditioned to believe are bad a priori.

      These are the things which have enabled us to not only survive, but thrive. These are, furthermore, the things that have made survival worthwhile; without them life is reduced to the stagnant ticking of pointlessly complex mechanisms. <br/>

"Happiness" alone is not a sound basis for any morality. In Islamic there are men who will happily throw acid in the face of young girls who seek an education, relish sawing the heads off unbelievers, proudly indoctrinate their own children into becoming suicide bombers.

      Perhaps, if they were a majority (it is unlikely that the amount of pleasure gained by disfiguring others would be more than the pain received, but whatever) it would be moral.  It all depends how you define morality, really.  I'm a bit of an emotivist myself. <br/> 
As it is, we view these societies as dystopian because they do not synch with what we value.  We say boo to them.  But if we lived in those societies, we would say yay.  Why?  Because we are happy!   <br/> 
What it all comes down to is basically what we prefer.  I would like everyone to be happy. And I think that everyone else wants to be happy too.  HEre we come to psychological egoism, which is the belief that everything we do we do for self-interest, or happiness.  And I think that it is possible for people to deny great amounts of happiness, but in doing so, they gain a little bit of happiness, or at least think they will.  But it all depends on your definition of happiness I guess.  The will is irrational though.  I'm just saying that I think you'd be pretty . .. well .. . happy in happy land. <br/> 
As I said before, I don't know what my moral beliefs are.  I was certainly not interested in seeming like a more sophisticated person when I realized it was possible that I was a brain in a vat; I was nine at the time and didn't particularly care if others liked me.  I'm just a philosophical person who likes thinking about things, does not simply accept ideas, and is too lazy to actually read any philosophy.

      Wozzeck, that's not the same thing. In the example you give, the girls and unbelievers are very clearly being made  <em>unhappy</em> . Greatly so, in fact. We are talking about a hypothetical society where everyone is happy with their given state of existence, whatever that may be. The question is what outside basis do you have for deciding whether that society is moral. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am not necessarily endorsing sje's view; see my post below. I would try to keep character attacks and personal speculation out of this. I realize that anyone's chosen philosophical views are basically a form of ego gratification, and therefore require some level of disdain for those who think differently, but let's at least try to stay conscious of that.

      I disagree with the idea that people would know that they are not  <em>really</em>  happy, that they are lacking something.  I think I agree with the philosophy of newspeak, that people won't understand the concept of freedom if there are no words to describe it.   <br/> 
I disagree with the whole thing about real happiness and fake happiness.   <br/> 
And about Brave New: from what I understand of it, the author is just biased about the ideals of society of his time, that freedom is The Greatest Good, and that lack of free will is bad.  Well, it is true that free will is essential for happiness in the society we live in today, and if it was just taken away, we'd be unhappy.  But if there is a way that happiness is given to us, then what is the problem?  People are just supposed to be shocked because they have been conditioned to hate the lack of freedom.  Besides that, there is no substantial argument. <br/>

      I think sje has a point. But the problem with the relativist definition of happiness is that it can basically be taken to absurd levels. If you take the very narrow definition of happiness as pleasure, it is basically a physical feeling based on endorphins going to your brain, with no higher mental or philosophical significance. So a person who is tied up for his whole life, drugged out of consciousness, and fed endorphins through a tube would be considered "happy" under that definition. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Which isn't technically wrong, because he would  <em>feel</em>  happy. But this reduces human existence and its significance to a sub-animal level. And in order to value our humanity we at least have to  <em>believe</em>  that there is something more to our existence. It is hard to say what that something is - I would express it as self-awareness and the expansion of consciousness. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The question, then, is whether totalitarian societies actually restrict consciousness in some way. I would say that this is the case for 1984. With Brave New World it gets trickier, since they were actually making individuals naturally predisposed to behave in certain ways and prefer certain ways of existence. It is immoral to destroy or restrict existing consciousness, but is it immoral to simply create beings with a naturally limited capacity for it, such as the Gammas and Epsilons? As opposed to not creating them at all? How is it different from breeding animals? (Note: I am assuming the lack of any sort of spiritual essence) <br/> 
 <br/> 
What ultimately happens with Bernard in Brave New World is based on the presupposition that despite all social conditioning people will still have natural tendencies towards love, modesty, and individual attachments. If this presupposition is wrong, then there would really be no problem. So it all depends on your assumptions about human nature, or the lack thereof.

      That's very sensible. Totalitarian societies by definition restrict consciousness. External control = restriction.  <br/> 
 But  <strike>most</strike>  societies we've seen so far do the same thing for one reason or another using tribalism and mythology. <br/> 
 And if one equates personal consciousness to freedom, there are no free societies. <br/> 
 The ones like our own that encourage morons to trumpet  <em>We are Free!</em>  at every chance are chillingly similar to these literary ones. <br/>

      The bigger issue most people also seem to have with  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Brave New World</span>  is the heavily enforced class system (though it  <em>would</em>  keep us from having to deal with those filthy Gammas and Deltas...

It definitely wasn't really as much of a dystopia and it continued to perpetuate the myth of the noble savage. Was it great? No, not really. I mean, there were still serious problems with it as a society, but it wasn't anywhere near  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">1984</span> .

      You're being annoying because the point you keep trying to argue is naive, irrational, and frightening. <br/> 
 <br/> 
How can you argue against what I said about criteria for happiness? You honestly think everyone has the same criteria? That's ridiculous. Some people would be happiest being in a stable marriage with two kids. Others would be downright miserable in such a situation. Some want the marriage but not the kids. Some want kids but can't stand the idea of being married. And these are just two things that might differ from person to person.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't see how psychological egoism contradicts anything I've said, or repudiates anything you've said. It's a theory I believe to largely hold true, by the way. <br/>

      Okay .. .but please don't ignore me >_< <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you reduce happiness to chemicals in the brain, and if you keep these chemicals at the optimum (which the brain does not allow, by the way, but let's assume we fix that), then a person will have to be happy, even if you are raping him.  SO yeah, in this society, people get the happy chemical from different things, sure.  But if you ignore outside stimuli, and just give them the happy chemical direct, then they'd simply always be happy.  In that case, they would not argue that their rights are being violated.  Why?  Because happy people don't complain.  They are too happy.  All I'm saying is that if this society were to exist, in which the happiness for all is  <em>ensured</em> , then I would not protest against it.  Other people would protest it, and that is what I have a problem with, because I don't think they thought things out, most of the time.  IT is only wrong to them due to socialization, being taught that it is wrong for your freedom to be taken away, which I don't think is  <em>a priori</em>  true.  And I especially think that they wouldn't complain in the state of eternal happiness, because that is a contradiction.  Because people will always choose what they think will bring happiness, they will choose to stay in the happy land.   <br/> 
But yes, the government taking away rights is wrong, but that is only because it makes people unhappy.  Freedom makes people happy, but not necessarily so.  This is what my point is.  And I do doubt such a siocety is possible, and I would not advocate such a society because I doubt we would have the ability to do it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like the Matrix.  I would have chosen to be in the matrix instead of outside it.  But it would have been better if instead of this life, the world in which everyone is constantly happy would have been better.  I believe they covered this in the film.  Was it that the humans didn't believe in the world, the reason why it failed?  I don't think this makes any sense.  Even if they didn't believe in the world (which I doubt, since reality is constructed by all your perceptions since you were born.  In order to judge a reality as false in an emotional or logical sense, you need contact with the "realer" reality), they would still be happy, and wouldn't wish for anything else.  They would continue to remain slaves. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I apologize if my knowledge of neurology and The Matrix and psychological egoism leaves something to be desired.

      some people are happy being controlled, but that is hardly the norm, you know?  And they are happy when they have made the choice to be controlled.  You know what I mean? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I couldn't force someone to be happy living under my thumb; but it is feasible that someone may choose that, because that is where they feel comfortable.  So, you aren't entirely wrong; some people even seem to subconsciously choose to be controlled.  But at some level, they made some choice.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I get what you are saying, if you never know any diffeit rent, you'll be happy doing whatever it is that is defined as happiness/pleasure-causing by your culture.  The thing is though, some things are basal, and sort of common themes in happiness for all people.  Not being physically injured, not being controlled, not being killed, not being imprisoned.  There are outliers, of course, but they all make  <em>a choice</em> , using  <em>free will</em> , to give up those basic sort of human rights of happiness.

      I think it's because your definition of happiness is too narrow. Sure, there are pleasure centers of the brain. But happiness is impossible to define. It means different things to different people. Is happiness contentment, or excitement, or infatuation, or something else? Some people aren't happy unless they're upset about something! Even providing you could cause "happiness," that doesn't justify robbing people of their freedom.

      See, though, I'm saying the exact opposite of what you are saying.  You can't force someone to feel happy, no matter how pleasant you might think the situation is.  They need to be able to choose their own situation to feel happy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I abduct someone, and keep them in my underground bunker, no matter how convinced I am that they will be happy there (I've got all their favorite foods, media, and have more or less made it exactly perfectly specified for them)--they won't be, they didn't choose to be there.  Meanwhile, if by some freak occurrence you meet a person who wants to be locked up in a dank bomb shelter, they will be happy when they  <em>choose</em>  to do engage in that sort of activity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And even  <strong>they</strong>  wouldn't if it was just some random abduction that they had no say in.  This just seems like the simplest allegory to me, even if it isn't perfect, you know?  Basically, and this is quite basic --but then again, Occam's Razor-- people need to have available the choice to decide their own happiness.  The state can't decide for you what happiness is, you, natural man, has certain conditions that need to be met for you to feel "happy".

      I . . . . <br/> 
My example wasn't a bunker underground, though.  Of course no one is going to be happy because of that.  The person won't be happy because he is used to freedom, and is taught that lack of freedom is a bad thing.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Okay, just imagine that there is a part of the brain which if you attach a small electrode to, it will cause the person to be indefinitely happy, even though it takes away their freedom.  WOuld you say this is wrong if the government forces everyone to do this?   <br/>

      Well, I suppose if such a thing existed, it would be wrong for the government to do it, yes.  Mostly because government and civilizations, it isn't their place to be implanting electrodes and forcing emotion.  They exist only to provide security, basic, life-enhancing infrastructure, and representation of the populace's wishes.  At least successful governments provide these things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It would be wrong for the government to start putting electrodes into the heads of people who had not consented to being implanted with them, no matter how "happy" it made them in the end.  I think you know this, and you're just being a contrarian.  I don't get why everyone is being so mean about it though, I've seen some even more ridiculous opinions espoused on Assetbar without boo being said.

      Whether it is right or wrong for the government to do it, or if it's not their place, is irrelevant though.  To me, all statements that say something is right or wrong are just "Yay" or "boo".  So whether it is immoral or not is irrelevant, or, if we go by utilitarianism, what is good or bad is anything that causes the most happiness, and this would be my scenario, no matter what the means are. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I really think this argument is going in circles. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I could be a contrarian, but I don't think that that is necessarily a bad thing.  I don't really think I know anything really; I haven't encountered a philosophical that I 100% agree with, so I don't accept any of them. And I just find pleasure in debating different philosophical views with people.  Not only is it fun, but I learn more about different theories and understand the views better, and others learn the views I am espousing better.  I am doing a socratic thing here, not a trolly thing.  I'm not meaning to annoy anyone.

      I totally understand where you're coming from.  I've got a lot of the same characteristics; I like to argue about things that I don't necessarily even agree with.

      The problem with the Matrix is that there was no oppression. OK, technically they're in some sort of entropy-defying energy tanks or something, but otherwise they just lived normal, late-90s lives. Compared to living in a dank ship in a grim, scorched future hiding in the cold from machines that want to kill them (a bit of an inversion of the Gnostic principles the film worked from)... hell, why not stay in the Matrix? It isn't real, but it's a hell of a lot better than the real world and there's no real downside. You're not under any form of social control.

      The thing is that this is only fine if you don't  <em>realize</em>  you're in the Matrix. Once you do, choosing to take the pill that makes you forget is essentially a lesser form of suicide. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is why I basically disagree with sje's main point - above all, the human consciousness seeks freedom and choice through self-awareness, the narrow definition of happiness being a secondary goal. Of course, this is an ideal form. The weaker among us (like that bald guy)  <em>would</em>  choose an imaginary, induced happiness that has no connection to reality.

      You forgot Norby. <br/>

Baby's Day Out was undoubtably the finest film to ever combine Joe Pantoliano, Joe Mantegna, and John Hughes. It is a classic of the mid-90s. I weep for your apparent ignorance.

      I'm not in that situation, but I think I could agree that staying in the Matrix would be fine. Even if I was aware of its nature. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Does it matter that it's virtual? Does it matter that this conversation about the validity of virtual spaces is taking place on a message board on the Internet? Does that somehow make it any less real? Does it mean I can't find you to be the rad, rude dude with the 'tude? That SJE can't be a dick about totalitarianism? Not at all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I see your correlation to drugs, but I disagree with it. It wasn't an entirely manufactured hallucination in that sense. That would be fundamentally solipsistic. This is a consensual, social experience taking place in a virtual space. Nor was it an artificially-induced happiness. It was just a normal life before we fucked everything up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess the issue is going to be one of whether you're aware of the Matrix and OK with it or not. I don't see why you wouldn't be fine with it, but I guess I can see your issue about the freedom of  <em>consciousness</em>  and wanting to know you're in the Matrix being crucial. Self-awareness is a valid goal, but at the same time I feel that the anti-Matrix people put too much emphasis on the body (again, they got their Gnosticism backwards). Guess which way the brain in a jar feels about this?

      Hmm, you make a good point about it being a social experience. I hadn't accounted for the fact that there were  <em>multiple</em>  consciousnesses in the Matrix rather than it just being a forced solipsism. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem is by what means you would choose to define it as consensual. It would be one thing if we all got together and created an awesome virtual world that everyone could choose to plug themselves into or even spend their whole lives in. But this is a world in whose creation we had no saying. Given that the film specifically states that it wasn't a utopia, and if we all had knowledge of the Matrix, wouldn't we blame all the major ills of the world  on our overlords, and wouldn't we be technically correct? Wouldn't we be afraid that they were constantly changing shit without our knowledge, like in Dark City? Wouldn't we wonder if we couldn't create a better world if only given the freedom to do so, even if we ultimately turned out to be wrong? It comes down to a matter of curiosity. If I knew there was another world out there, I would want to see it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is the point where this whole thing breaks down due to the incomplete and possibly even contradictory nature of the information we have about the Matrix. I wondered these things when I first saw it: How are new people formed? Do the machines create babies in test tubes and then plug them into the Matrix? But then how would people fall in love and have children? Would the Machines have to monitor who was virtually boning whom? Does the Matrix include an entire late 90's planet, complete with African genocides and Mideast conflicts, or is it more like The Truman Show, just being confined to America? So many questions.

      I kind of assumed that it contained artificial intelligences as well as human minds. And although my memory of the time frame of the Matrix isn't clear, I assumed that characters like Neo must have been living in the Matrix their whole lives... Thus, I assumed that it must have some means of artificial insemination and birthing and sustaining newborn children. And why not? Didn't it have a bit where it showed a baby being fed, actually? Whether these births corresponded to the virtual children of their parents, though, is an entirely different matter. I would guess not. Machines don't tend to be that sentimental.

      See, though, I'm saying the exact opposite of what you are saying.  You can't force someone to feel happy, no matter how pleasant you might think the situation is.  They need to be able to choose their own situation to feel happy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I abduct someone, and keep them in my underground bunker, no matter how convinced I am that they will be happy there (I've got all their favorite foods, media, and have more or less made it exactly perfectly specified for them)--they won't be, they didn't choose to be there.  Meanwhile, if by some freak occurrence you meet a person who wants to be locked up in a dank bomb shelter, they will be happy when they  <em>choose</em>  to do engage in that sort of activity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And even  <strong>they</strong>  wouldn't if it was just some random abduction that they had no say in.  This just seems like the simplest allegory to me, even if it isn't perfect, you know?  Basically, and this is quite basic --but then again, Occam's Razor-- people need to have available the choice to decide their own happiness.  The state can't decide for you what happiness is, you, natural man, has certain conditions that need to be met for you to feel "happy".

      That's only part of existentialism. The important part is that along with the fact that existence has no  <em>inherent</em>  meaning comes the realization that you are not only free, but in fact inescapably  <em>required</em>  to choose, create, and live your own meaning, with no universal guidelines to tell you how to choose correctly, that knowledge coming only after the fact if at all. Hedonism is certainly a choice, but it is no more a 'natural' consequence of nihilism than any other philosophy.

      Don't you see what you are saying? At some level, you have to make a choice. If you choose not to choose, that is also a choice. If the thought of unlimited freedom is frightening and overwhelming, and you choose to give up this freedom by accepting voluntary slavery, or adopting a strict moral code, that is still a choice. No matter through how many such layers you defer responsibility, at the bottom level, you are always making a choice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course some people are less free than others, but there is almost always a choice. For example, if you are a slave or a prisoner, you have the freedom to attempt escape or fight against your captors. Even if you have no chance of winning and it would mean certain death, it is still an option, and if you choose not to do it, that is a choice you are freely making. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At least that's what Sartre says. To me it brings up the problem of suicide, since by this logic, suicide is also an option. But Camus had this whole argument about how suicide is actually the negation of freedom, or the flight from responsibility - I don't remember it exactly. Also, neither of them account for a situation where even suicide weren't an option, say, if you were chained to wall. But anyway, such extreme cases don't really apply to us in this conversation.

      I think we can agree that while such extreme situations are certainly choices they are Hobson's Choices and thus it's kind of a dick thing to say that you  <em>chose</em>  to be a slave by not trying to free yourself. <br/>

OK for Spartacus, OK for philosophical discussion on the nature of free will, but still kind of a dick thing to say to people.  <em>Richard</em> .

      Well, yes, that would be the essence portion of "existence precedes essence". I wasn't stating hedonism as an absolute, but a personal choice. Even then I dislike using the term "hedonism". The manner it is so commonly used popularly has a connection to the philosophic meaning, but it really takes it too far. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I prefer it in the "happiness is the ultimate goal" manner. Well, living as long as possible is the ultimate goal, but doing so in the most pleasing manner possible is the close follow-up. Hence why, among many other reasons, I don't drink, smoke, do drugs or many other things that would commonly be ascribed under "hedonism". <br/>

I do recline on a chaise lounge and eat grapes fed to me by a beautiful woman while being fanned, however. Who doesn't though? <br/>

      That is true, actually.  I have heard you can show porn on Cartoon Network. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was talking about the network, and social norms.  Comedy Central allows you to say most swears and slurs on its network, depending on the time, though, of course.  And the advertisers are obviously okay with it. <br/> 
IT is not as though they said "Oh, well Mr. Chappelle said the N word, but he spelled it with an A, so it's perfectly alright; we'll still endorse you." <br/>

      They never bleep out the N word on Chappelle's Show. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They bleep out the F word, but they don't have to.  Also, have you seen The Stash (or whatever it's called.  The uncensored things they show on Comedy Central on saturday or Friday nights)?  Pretty much the only thing they don't show is frontal nudity. <br/>

      Yeah but that's at almost 3 in the morning (I know because I watched Zack Galifinakis' stand up special from The Stash). <br/>

Every Saturday and Sunday morning at 1 A.M., a movie, comedy special or animated program is shown unedited for language. This is called the Secret Stash. It premiered on July 4, 2003 (with the unedited cable television debut of the South Park movie). Though no language is censored on the Secret Stash, most nudity in the programs is still edited out, with the exception of limited nudity allowed in animated programs (such as Drawn Together) and the occasional topless scene.</em></div> <br/> 
In my experience, at 3 (or maybe 4) they show infomercials. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your argument was that they did bleep it out. <br/>

      You can show porn, or whatever you want, on any non-network television.  The FCC has no regulatory control over those broadcasts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Which is why I absolutely hate Chiller.  I can't tell you guys how a horror television network had been my dream since I was but a wee, small, childperson, and how that dream was deferred upon viewing fucking Chiller. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chiller edits out cusses, nudity, and get this...GORE. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is a horror network, not even on basic goddamn cable.  It is a special premium network, and they don't even show sideboob and beheadings. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I'm sure Viacom is scratching their big, collective noggins, wondering why Chiller has such a low viewership.  I'll tell you why; because horror fans aren't just going to be content to watch twenty hours of Millennium a day, with an additional four hours dedicated to debt consolidation commercials.

      Chapelle's Show isn't any better than Mind of Mencia. They both flounder around in the same stupid racist mentality that everyone needs to get over. It's like Chapelle and Mencia are both seven years old and have just realized that some people are different colors and maybe talk differently and  <em>isn't that hilarious?? tee hee hee tee hee titter</em>

      Chapelle's Show is maybe a step up from Mencia, but yea, you're pretty dead on. Another thing is that both of them (but especially Mencia) seem to try way too hard to push this idea that what they're saying is just  <em>so outrageous</em>  and if you don't like them it must be because you're offended rather than because they're just trite and not that funny. The first couple of episodes of Chapelle had some good sketches, but that was it. I think a lot of white people really try too hard to give it more credit than it deserve.

      I agree that they both have the terrible mentality about race, etc, but the reason why Mencia is  <em>worse</em>  is just because his comedy is so much more .. . mean-spirited.  So is Dave's, but Mencia is such a negative person, I can't stand it.  And his jokes.  HE is all angry about the stupidity of humanity in general, and pretends to be a voice of reason, but he is not.  HE is the voice of foundless cynicism.  "Have you ever noticed how the number for Hooked on Phonics is 1-800 ABCDEFG?  But I thought that they couldn't read!!" <br/> 
[cue laughs] <br/> 
First off, I'm sure that 99% of the people who benefit off Hooked on Phonics are below the age of 12, and you are not even allowed to order a thing on the phone unless you are 18.  The phone number is obviously for the parents of those kids who are struggling.  Secondly, that is not phonics.  If learning how to read is as easy as reciting the alphabet, we'll be all set.  I'm sure almost all alliterate people over the age of 10 know the alphabet.  The problem is putting the letters together into meaningful sounds.   <br/> 
So right, you made a small, tenuous connection.  Hey look, slight incongruency, let's laugh.  That's annoying enough without him ranting on about what retards they are. DEEDEEDEE.   <em>Shut up, Ned Holness</em> . <br/> 
I don't care if you steal jokes.  I care about the fact that you are just not funny, at all, and you can't deliver.  A comedian can be cynical, sure, like Carlin, but he has to actually have a good reason and good jokes. <br/> 
Chappelle actually has a few clever ideas for skits.  True Hollywood stories with Charlie Murphy, and the KKK one come to mind.  But they make it seem alright to say discriminatory things.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But all in all, the worst comedy is in the movie How High, featuring Method Man and Redman.  Do not support them by buying this movie. <br/>

      Say what you will about  <em>Chappelle's Show.</em>  I essentially agree with most of what has been said here. But at the end of the day, flawed or not, Chappelle makes me bust a gut - actually laugh with my entire body - at least once an episode. I can't say that about many other shows.  <br/>

It's a comedy show. It makes me laugh. I won't ask for anything more.

      I don't want to get in one of these bottom of a really long assetbar page philosophical arguments, but WHAT?  OF COURSE race is a thing.  And OF COURSE it is a HUGE deal that we have a black president.  Racism can't be defeated by being one of those people who "doesn't see color," but by accepting differences and education and role models and subtle unconscious changes in attitude and shit all kinds of tiny and huge things but it sure as hell MATTERS.  When my dad turned 18 this would have been just the vaguest tiny possibility.  When my grandfather turned 18 it was out of the question.  When my great grandfather turned 18 I think it may have even been, like, illegal.  I'm not making a big deal out of it, it IS a big deal.    <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry, I just get riled when people confuse talking about race at all for racism and imply that you should just somehow sweep race back under the rug like not recognizing it will solve all the problems.

      Don't you get it? Obama solved Racism with Hope. Now, because there's no Racism anymore, we're all treated completely equally by Society, so it's rude to even mention there's such a thing. Yep, thank goodness we took care of Racism.

      Out here we think that Gavin Newsom is a wealthy, pro-business conservative. And honestly, he really is. The gay marriage thing is  just a sham. It's an issue where he knew it would get him plenty of attention, buy him political capital at home while being almost entirely non-controversial locally, and it would cost him basically nothing to implement. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So to conservatives across the country he's a dangerous leftist radical. Hell, even to a lot of the scaredy-cat Democrats out there, but locally he's a do-nothing Conservative that just wants to push business interests and have flashy press conferences.

      I see what you're saying, but it's also an issue of "I am voting for someone to be president. I do not give a damn about their race. I care about their policies. Shouldn't we care a lot more about that than race?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would vote for a furry if he had solid political views and a proven history of acting on them in a manner I agree with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If it happened in the 60s maybe it would be more important and shocking, but now it feels about as big a deal as having elected our first Hawaiian. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Times have changed and are changing still. We've pretty long ago reached the point where you can't be a dick about race without people pointing out how you're a massive dick and hating the fuck out of you for it. We're moving further into the point where you can't be a dick to someone about their sexuality, but it's still a solid ways off. At least a generation or so I'd say. We definitely aren't anywhere near the point where you can't be a dick to atheists though. It's more subtle, but people still hella hate atheists. I believe the last time I heard we were one of the least liked minority groups.

      Yes and no. First of all, it greatly varies according to your locale and your socio-economic stratum. The people I meet at NYU are obviously PC to ridiculous extremes. But the Russian and Polish immigrants and white trash kids I grew up with around Paterson, NJ would regularly and casually spout off the most vile racist shit, unrebuked and unaware that there was even anything wrong with it. People from the South can tell you many similar stories. And didn't you see the frat guys in the Borat movie? There are many places and social circles where racism is still pretty acceptable. SF and NYC are not the whole country. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But that's all largely beside the point, because racial problems in this country are largely systemic rather than the result of conscious discrimination - a combination of historic, economic, and unfortunately, cultural problems. Just look at it this way - up until now, the most visible role models for black kids have been rappers and basketball players. Many of them didn't even see the road of college and professional success as being open to them, whether this perception was correct or not. And suddenly, the most famous person in the whole fucking universe is a black guy who is intelligent, professional, and by most indications actually wanting to do good in the world. From that standpoint alone, I'd say it's pretty damn important. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But you're right, I am pretty tired of hearing this same thing reiterated in about 50 different article-length ways, which is why I've stopped feeding my news addiction since the election.

      When this computer was set up at my house I suspected that my sister used Papyrus for some Myspace picture and didn't change it back.  I didn't know how to change it to something better, and I didn't think it was that offensive.

      seriously dude? the list goes like this: <br/> 
1.  <strike>Comic Sans</strike> <br/> 
2.  <em>Papyrus</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
it's cool. you didn't know. (you right-click in the text box and select the 'text toolbar' option.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
also, you can automatically double/half the scale of whatever you have selected by hitting ctrl and plus or minus. my life changed the day i found paint could do cool stuff like that. (also you can clone selections by holding control and moving said selection around. just make sure it's where you want to drop it when you let go of the mouse. ctrl-zing that biz mucks up your picture hardcore.)

      elbox, just because a fratboy likes something doesn't mean it is bad. Just because you don't like how they talk about their bros doesn't mean they can't appreciate good comedy. Sure, they probably couldn't write their way out of a paper bag. But last I checked it takes a lot more effort to come up with a good idea than to know when someone else's idea is good. It's just like when everyone loved  <em>Family Guy</em>  and all of a sudden fratboys liked it and then it finally got another season and the new season sucked and then people "realized" the first seasons were never that good. I'm already seeing some douchebags saying that  <em>Arrested Development</em>  isn't that good after seeing some fratboys enjoy it.

      Dude, the immortal skeleton for the win.  You can frighten others out of their money. <br/>

Although saving a bro's life is pretty darn noble.  But no way would I save a homeless mang.  I mean, God made them homeless for a reason. <br/> 
I suppose it would be cool to be able to kill as many homeless people as you want though. <br/>

      I also choose option 1. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't really know what it's like to have a brother, so maybe I'd choose that if I did and had more information. Would he have already been paralyzed and learned to live a reasonably comfortable life? Or is it that he would be paralyzed now if I chose any other option? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Saving a homeless man's life isn't so great if that's all you're gonna do. Most likely he'll just drink himself to death or simply prolong his suffering in some other way. Besides, a small fraction of that million dollars could drastically and permanently improve, if not outright save, the lives of several homeless people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There aren't that many people I would like to kill, at least not so far. Besides, it would probably get me tangled up in all sorts of international spy intrigue. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know how loyal my friends would be if I couldn't even remember who all of them were. And I definitely wouldn't want every single one of them calling me to hang out every weekend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Immortality would be nice, but I saw Pirates of the Carribean and being a skeleton doesn't seem that great.

      Yeah, I'm totally down with the immortality option. I can make a lot more money that way over time and none of the others really interest me even remotely. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus, 1 million? That's nothing. I couldn't even buy a decent house out here for that. The sort of places that in Kansas were going for maybe $100,000 or less are more like $700,000. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, instead of being a skeleton could I maybe be a lich or something? I'd be much more into that. Just a skeleton is better than nothing, but I'd still prefer to eat and fuck.

      Agreeing with some on the skeleton thing; there's really no point in being immortal if you can't live it up for the rest of eternity with the pleasures that require having a body.  Since I don't have a brother, I guess I won't feel too bad about taking number 1.

      The version I watched had Deckard dreaming about a unicorn. Then in the last scene, the police officer who states cpnglxynchos' mentioned line has left an origami unicorn in his flat after apparently sparing Rachael's life. I took this to mean that he had some insight into Deckard's mind and memories in the same way that Deckard had into Rachel's. <br/>

      I think the book was significantly better and not even remotely concerned with the possibility that he might have been a replicant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is actually why it took me a number of viewings to begin to appreciate the film. It's only vaguely related to the novel. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think Ridley Scott thinks he's a replicant, however. That doesn't necessarily make it so.

      I just started watching the Blu-Ray last evening as it showed up just briefly before this conversation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Synchronicity! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyhow, I read it a long time ago. High school, freshman year IIRC. After re-reading a detailed summary it was closer than I had thought, but it still cut out very important aspects and themes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end it was more about what it means to be human. Not that Deckard might be a replicant, but that the replicants might be more human or equally human by means of actions and feelings than he is. About the nature of what makes us human and them merely robots. A common Dickian theme that the film still explores, but in a somewhat different way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, the title is unrelated and makes absolutely no sense. Scott just ripped it off (i.e. bought the rights to only the name because he liked it) from a William Burroughs screenplay where it was about people selling black-market surgical equipment. Y'know, where it actually makes sense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It still cuts out the very important aspects about why people own artificial animals, care so much about real animals, and place such a high value on empathy. Those never get explained in the film, but are integral to the novel. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I eventually learned that the film is doing its thing and that is cool too. I need to re-read the book though. It's been a long time.

      When the  <em>title</em>  is  <em>Do <strong>Androids</strong> Dream of Electric Sheep?</em>  it's a pretty big hint that the narrator might be an android.  Maybe he wanted to be more subtle for the higher class theatre audience (everyone knows movie-goers are higher class than readers)

      Not really. I mean, if you want to get specific at one point in the book they actually test him and, no, he isn't an andy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It also depends strongly on Dick's view of "androids" as people without empathy or human emotion and how he felt they were to be reviled and perhaps there might one day be a war between humans and them. The issue was that by killing them was Deckard gazing into the abyss and becoming like them? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Both book and film address very different sides and aspects of fundamentally Dickian concepts about what it means to be human, but do it in very different ways. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said I feel that the issue of whether he is or isn't is actually better than if it was explicit. Both have profound and relevant meanings to impart on the film and its themes. In this respect I view that both are correct in that they provide shading and meaning. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Objectively? Dick never intended him to be, the screenwriters it seems never intended it, but Scott felt he was and tried to strongly imply as much.

      Ray too. <br/> 
Okay, the top strip contains Lyle and either Teodor or Connie, but most likely Connie, and the bottom one has Ray behind either a table or bar or counter, and Teodor is walking up to him.  He's Teodor because he has the T sweater on that Penny made him. <br/> 
That is definitely Lie Bot though.  On the lower left hand side.  Compare the figure with  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413120549/https://m.assetbar.com/uua6Z3Wn7.gif">this</a> .  As you can see, the sunglasses and the nose match up.  It is definitely Lie Bot.  It could be a flashback, although I have always thought that flashbacks had darker backgrounds.  However, it is an unfinished comic.

Next two strips are teodor strips.  I'm guessing that this is the upcoming "Teodor is raped by Lyle arc" I've been hearing rumors of. <br/>

      Ok so basically I'm going through the archive in random order and it isn't random at all. I've got the "Lyle puking on a football" strip 4 times already and I keep getting the new strips.

      There were folks in Onstad's recent interview's comment section saying that Achewood is past it's prime. I almost believed them. Almost. But then I remembered this strip, which is from 2009 and is now the most viewed and 3rd most commented, beating out things like Comic Sans. Ain't nobody in the place would step to Onstad if he was sippin' real nearby. They just like being on the internet.

      you  <em>do</em>  realize all those comments were Himself, right? <br/> 
 <br/> 
alternatively: <br/> 
if it really is past its prime, it's gonna go out with a bang, 'cos what you say is true. the facts will still be true until O goes on another vacation-trip where we'll all refresh for no reason and comment like Harper's 27 Women.

I admit I had to look up Harper's 27 Women, but now that I get it, it is funny.

      You should have seen the guano crazy that showed up to my last yard sale. There was this crazy old mexican lady who spent, no shit, two and a half hours sitting on the lawn counting the old vhs tapes for sale and rearranging them on the racks. I don't think she had anywhere else to go.
