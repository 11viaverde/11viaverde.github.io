      David Foster Wallace isn't pretentious. The guy is hilarious. It's all meta-comedy and just basically fucking with the way you read and the way people write. He gets conceptual on our asses. If you don't like that kinda thing you shouldn't be reading it, it's just a different art form. <br/>

      I wouldn't say it's inherently pretentious. I'd just say that for every four pages of a David Foster Wallace novel, there's a Jonathan Safran Foer one-liner.

      The difference between Foer and Wallace is that Foer's characters are unrelatable, and he doesn't seem to care about them with depth beyond Lifetime-Original-Movie styles. Wallace is so obsessed with every tiny detail of every little thing that it's impossible, for me at least, to not join him in the hyperengagement.

      Actually, I wasn't even stating my own opinion of David Foster Wallace.  Besides a short story here and there, I haven't read him, and I'm willing to remain indifferent on him until I do; I'm way too behind in books I do have to get caught in the Infinite Jest; I bought a bargain copy of Interviews with Hideous Men book but I don't know if I've ever read any of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm tempted to say I might like him; a lot of things I like (music, movies) can be described as "fucking with the way you ______," but I totally understand some people wanting to call it pretentious.  They can be wrong a number of times, but they're often right.

      And hopefully this is the part where the conversation changes from one about David Foster Wallace to one about David Berman and doesn't look back.  <br/>

      The only thing that kills me about Berman is that he seems to be slipping these days.  Tanglewood Numbers was a disappointment, I thought, and, almost like the S Malkmus solo albums, his lyrics started to become too ironically corny or just straight up ham.  I've heard similar complaints about the new album; I haven't even heard it yet.

      OK, woodenteeth - "1 years" later (closer to two, I'd say) I'd like to officially reverse my stance on the work of David Foster Wallace. I humbly admit that when I made the above comment I was speaking directly out of my ass. In actuality, I hadn't at that time read enough to really have a well-informed opinion on the subject. I spoke as though I had. This was wrong. I'm sorry. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still haven't taken a shot at  <em>Infinite Jest,</em>  but  <em>Girl With Curious Hair</em>  was amazing and the Kenyon commencement speech basically changed my life.

      Read all of the short stories and essays, there is much gold in there. Sometimes it takes some digging, but I often find the digging becomes part of the fun (which I'm sure was his intention). Infinite Jest is just a long series of interconnected short stories. Read it that way and you'll knock it over quite simply. I never found it that hard going, it was just too entertaining to be a chore.

      The "borderline" part is what bothers me. Seems to me that Chris Onstad wouldn't want his work described as an incomplete version of somebody else's, and DFW wouldn't want his work held up as a standard of perfection. Comparing Onstad to DFW is fair and could be interesting. Saying one man's writing is like a failed version of another's is kind of rude. <br/>

      remember when you made those little shoe box diarama of like the plains and the africa, like?  and you were supposed to show how the cheetah would like hide in the bushes or go and get some water but then also sometimes rip like ribs and bladders out of the zebras?  But then you'd wait till the last minute and fake it all and say the cheetahs were hiding in the pine cone you used as a bush and you'd still get a B anyways cause like who fails 3rd grade? <br/>

Yeah this strip is like when you looked through the little peephole of your neighbor's diarama shoe box and it was like watching winston churchill and F.D.R. play hopscotch when they were both five.  Just brilliant and perfect and all like that.

      Not quite, but one that would try to cheer him up and not be put off by his fickle but generally subdued personality.  He's been grumping around way too much lately.

      I will use the last line when someone asks me what kind of shoes I like. Which is not often. My most recent pair were picked without my knowing and appeared where my old ones were.
