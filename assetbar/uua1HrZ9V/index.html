Let me get microsoft word open on my desktop, and I'll type up a proposal. Let's see if I can get Macmillan publishing interested...

      30 panels per comic, one update per week, 25 comics. Ray will end up having a rap battle with the King of Ireland to decide the fate of Ireland's potatoes. He'll win but be sentenced to execution because he was so good. The King's daughter (who looks a lot like Tina) will take pity on him and plot a daring escape that is helped along the way after Roast Beef tumbles into this crazy world after eating a Mexican Magical Burrito.

The correct answer is to dismissively compare both of them to the apples from your friend's orchard up in Tomales. Complaining that they don't plan to donate any of the profits to help the situation in Latvia (there is no situation in Latvia, but she will be attracted to learn about any situation that she is not yet aware of, yet unwilling to admit that she does not know of it) would be the advanced move to seal the deal.

 <em>"Bowfinger" was good, but it was probably more due to Steve Martin who has, likewise, decided that family comedies pay better than real work. It also has Heather Graham taking her top off (even if you don't see anything) for, like, the fiftieth time or something.</em>

      hipsters have boners for organic farming because the farmers that use chemicals and farm improperly are the sort of farmers that employ laborers that are in this country illegally.  basically, hipsters hate brown guys and feel that they dont deserve to earn money in our country.

      Oh, I'm sure there's plenty of typos more recent than that.  In fact, I would assume that most of my typos could be considered  <em>extremely</em>  recent. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I meant that the only amount of PBR that would cause me to blame the spelling mistake  <em>on the PBR</em>  would be equal to one (1) world-ful. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you really did go back through my comments, you would no doubt know the amount of times I've posted under the influence of other alcoholic beverages (scotch, bourbon, gin, vodka, beers that aren't PBR).  Sadly, spelling mistakes would be preferred to what I normally post in these situations (e.g. married women and how I might feel about one of them), but they often garner at least a few chubbies. <br/>

      To be fair, it is probably their best LP. Double LP. Whatever. <br/> 
It doesn't seem as though UK hipsters are as aware of the Minutemen as their transatlantic bretheren might be, although having never knowingly inspected a hipster's record collection, this would be a guess based purely on superficial factors (albeit an almost entirely accurate guess, given that hipsters are composed of nearly 100% superficial atoms). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Further speculation: The record collection of the average UK hipster contains: <br/> 
Let It Be (12"! Gasp!) snatched from parents' attic <br/> 
Perhaps one other "random" vinyl LP or 45 picked up from an ill-advised foray to BHF or Oxfam <br/> 
Any/all of the following: Arctic Monkeys, Babyshambles, that other terrible Doherty band, and whatever indie disco/electro pop is currently flavour of the month. <br/> 
Everything else stored as .mp3 on a MacBook. <br/> 
Record player wholly optional; if one exists, it is just about as functionally useful as its non-existant parallel.

      The Mexican man selling you tomatoes from his pickup at the farmer's market does not farm organically and could never be convinced to. He does, however, own a family farm as his children laboring at the stand (and longing to get away from this arduous, hellishly rural life) clearly attest to. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the same time the girl at the next stall has a Masters in Pre-Colonial Feminist Fiction from Mt. Holyoke and bought her small organic farm with the inheritance from her father as a means of repurposing the profits of patriarchal land-rape into sustainable agrarianism. <br/>

      A long time ago in a middle school science fair one of my friends grew plants in different rooms with different genres of music playing nonstop. He found that it actually makes a difference. Classical was the best for making small flowers grow, and rap was the worst. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, like any middle school science fair experiment, it was designed horribly. There were several variables he didn't control, such as sunlight, humidity, and et cetera.

      Classical has, apparently, shown to be helpful to plant growth in a number of studies, most of which list hip hop or heavy metal as the worst. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, I think at least one Scandinavian study has found the opposite, that plants love them some Pantera. <br/>

I suspect it has something to do with what sort of music the researchers like or consider worthy.

      It has been my experience that you continue to marvel at how astoundingly fucking dumb you were when you were younger. When I was twenty I was amazed at some of the dumb moves I pulled when I was seventeen and at twenty-five I was incapable of understanding why I did such idiotic things at twenty. <br/>

Realizing that this is a continual cycle and that you are just as fucking dumb right now, that you will look back on this and curse yourself from the future, is what we really mean by wisdom. <br/>

      What I've found to be true (through my limited experience), is that dumb has no age. For every punk-ass kid, there is an adult of equal neck-wringing vapidity. Same with awesomeness.

      How is that intuitive? If plants grown with music playing grow faster than those in silence, then it would be logical to assume that the louder the music the faster the growth. I'm not saying that it would be true, but it would be a reasonable assumption to go on until further evidence presented itself.

      I'm just saying, the more intense music harms it and the softer music doesn't.  When they say classical, I'm not sure if they mean actually Classical or just "old piano and violin stuff."  Either way, nothing produced before the mid 20th century can compare in terms of intensity except maybe, I don't know, The Rite of Spring or New World, which aren't classical anyway.  Regardless, the more intense music harms it, the softer helps it, so wouldn't silence at least be better than intense music?  That's why it seems intuitive to me.

Why is this discussion still going on? I thought that we had established that the scientists who conduct experiments to determine which "genres" of music are most beneficial to plant growth, aren't really scientists at all; just losers with too much time wanting to justify their opinion of music.

      I eat prepared foods with some frequency, and I am snobby about those prepared foods. <br/>

Mostly it is just horseradish hummus, though.  I had a pesto chicken salad one time from Trader Joe's that I obsessed over days after it was gone.  The same thing actually happened with some Whole Food's Indian-inspired chicken salad.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The strangest thing is, had you asked me yesterday if I liked chicken salad, I would've definitely said no.  Assetbar has brought up cold salad demons I thought I had long suppressed.

      Actually, I was stopped many times, but more often by [insert building name] security guards and Police Community Support Officers (read: "over-zealous and misinformed civilians with little to no training") than actual police. I did once get interviewed by the Met's Counter-Terrorism Unit after having attempted to photograph a building near Victoria which apparently had some significant connection to the Gov't (not that it bore any external signs that would indicate as such). My experience of encounters with the Police was that they were very patient, understanding, and aware that by simply photographing the exterior facades of buildings from public property (i.e. roads and pavements) I was not committing any crimes%u2014at least not when these buildings were not considered for whatever reason to be sensitive or likely targets for terrorist attacks. Security guards would assume the worst of you until convinced otherwise, and the PCSOs, bless them, were only trying to do their jobs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This was maybe 2-4 years ago now, though, and I no longer live in the capital, so for all I know it may now be illegal to take pictures of buildings at all.

      The farmers market one block from my apartment mainly sells organic produce, at a little less the price of the supermarket, plus they take food stamps.
