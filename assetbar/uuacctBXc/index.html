      This is the best Achewood strip.  Unquestionably.  The transition from waterskiing to playing a saxophone with cowboy boots on is almost too much to handle.

      When i was about twelve, we were on a road trip, driving through the mountains in North Carolina.  It was about 12:30 at night, and my stepbrother and my sister were sleeping.  My brother and i were playing  our GameBoys.  Suddenly we heard this thud and a large white thing dragged across the passenger-side window.  My mom pulled to a literal screeching halt and immediately began to hyperventilate.  Between gasps we heard her say, "I just hit a  <em>person</em> ." <br/> 
 <br/> 
My brother and I began screaming blue murder, thinking it was a skull we'd seen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It turned out a woman was hitchhiking in a cocktail dress and very visibly drunk, and we'd hit her hand.  It cracked off the side mirror. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The fun part was wedging this drunken, injured woman between an eight-year-old on the verge of tears and myself while trying to convince her that yes, she needed to go to he hospital and no, we would not put the radio to classic rock. It was a long drive to Asheville.

      When I see "fix up a boat" my brain automatically brings forth memories of the movie Rookie of the Year where some kids have "wood, in the vague shape of a boat" and they fix it up by adding a used motor to the back. They then use their new, fully restored, boat-shaped piece of wood to pick up some middle school girls in one piece bathing suits.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then the one kid pitches the Cubs into the world series.

      I originally saw Ray just blissfully stomping around the boat playing free-form jazz. Easily one of my favorite strips.
