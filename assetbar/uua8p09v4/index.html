      I remember the days when Cartoon Network was in its infancy and all it had to show were Hana Barbera cartoons.  <br/>

Josie and the Pussycats, that one where Scooby and those other shitty cartoon characters raced all the time, that barbarian crap with the dude made of diamonds who would just stand around in the jungle yelling... <br/>

      Dude, Wacky Racers was a premium show, you take that back or I'll find you!!! <br/>

Also, old school Johnny Quest and Space Ghost.  The Perils of Penelope Pitstop wasn't so great though, and she sucked on Wacky Racers.

      Dexter and Courage were never part of Adult Swim (if that's what you were implying), and, if i remember correctly, Space Ghost C2C only ever had like 4 actual episodes premiere on adult swim, the last 4 episodes (which weren't all that good).

      Yeah but the  <em>OLD</em>  Tom & Jerrys with the good violence happened way before Hanna-Barbera got their grubby mitts on them.  Well, one of 'em directed a few, but the company that made shitty animation didn't exist yet.

      On the contrary, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera directed all the early Tom and Jerry toons (1940-1958), many of them true classics. After that they founded Hanna-Barbera Productions, which made some good shows in the sixties (The Flintstones, Top Cat, Yogi Bear etc.) but also churned out a lot of crap.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, what Bensington Butters thinks of Hanna-Barbera is less important to me than his stance on Warner Bros. I don't think I could trust someone who preferred Merry Melodies to Looney Tunes.

      I still harbor this eerie hatred for Hanna-Barbera the company though.  Limited animation blows. Gimme the old-school fully-animated shorts any time.  I always wondered why they had to take the cheap assembly-line approach after creating such good stuff beforehand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Quick - we need a shot of Fred Flinstone talking.  Oh wait - we'll just use the loop we did last time and change the mouth a bit to make it fit.  Brilliant!  Now let's run past the same house, tree and rock 30 times during the chase scene.  Brilliant!  No one will ever notice. <br/>

      But... but, both Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes were Warner Brothers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Otherwise you are indeed laying down the stone truth. When it comes to doing things right WB is where it is at. Disney? Fie on Disney and their childish nonsense! Fie on their original ideas almost always being terrible compared to the slightly less terrible stuff they just rip off from the public domain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You want fairy tales? You do not get to watch Disney movie with happy songs and the ending where everyone is being alive. I read you original Grimm's versions. Better still, I get old German grandmother read them to you in thick accent... you learn how silly your tolerance of Disney is!

For the record, I don't hate Disney - only a fool would deny the quality of  <em>Pinocchio</em>  - but I think Walt's status as Animation God owes more to his business acumen than artistic virtue.

      Warner Bros are where it is  <em>at</em>  with cartoons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Started good and just continued getting better. <br/> 
Is it terribly wrong of me to think the peak of their skills was Animaniacs?  I do recall once bashing my younger brother's head against a door when he tried to change the channel away from Animaniacs, and then being momentarily surprised that his reaction was less than cartoonish. <br/>

Look, you're new here, right?

But, before you go laming me (twice on this page, even) and calling me retarded, maybe you should consider the chance that you're the one out of the loop. <br/>

      Do you remember being in a car going through a tunnel as a child? I do. A long tunnel, through a mountain on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. When I was small, it was the stuff nightmares were made of. Why was everything suddenly orange? Why is it flashing? What if it never ends? What if the whole thing collapses?

      The other thing I remember from the USA Cartoon Express is that, in my area, at least, every commercial break featured at least one ad for the Church of Latter Day Saints (Mormons).  The only thing I ever though about it, though, as a kid, was that they got it wrong, and it should be  <em>Saturday</em>  Saints.

      Phrsst. It's not about which one is better. It's about which one a player, a man of class would like. No matter what the quality of Hanna-Barbera cartoons Disney has an entire media empire, defines the american identity, owns a suburb in Florida and is ruled by a bitter nazi who lives in permanent cryogenesis. Disney wins hands down on class. <br/>
