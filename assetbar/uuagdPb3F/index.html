      To be fair, if I were a subtitle writer for a movie, for example, and I had to translate a character saying "¡Chinga te!" or some such, I'd probably either have it say "Screw you!" or "Fuck you!" as those are basically the closest contextual analogs in English. The phrases are used very similarly in either language. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're right about the verbs, technically speaking, I've just heard far more Spanish speakers yell variations of "chingar" at people in the heat of anger than anything else. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But hey, at this point we're probably splitting hairs, eh? :)

      In no way is my disgust for your (however feigned) post-Renaissance English style of imperialism an advocation of my country's current style of imperialism. I'd gladly dip all of my country's imperialist in wax with yours, position their bodies in dances such as Hitler and Stalin in  <em>Europa Europa</em> , and put a pair of you at every border checkpoint across the world, in celebration of patois, evolution, neologisms, and most especially language as a dynamic and vital entity which breaths anew with every generation, not to mention every village it enters. Frankly, though, the dialogue in Achewood does a better job of teaching evolutionary language. Which makes me wonder: why are you here?

      Excellent comment.  I've only been reading the comments recently but I had a strong desire to question why soticoto, who regularly berates the very idea of American English, would be spending so much time around a comic written in an aggressively American dialect.  If only he'd had an answer.

      Think about it from the opposite perspective. <br/> 
Imagine I never delved into american creations at all. How then would I know to dislike them?  <br/> 
Consider also the fact that it does account for the majority of internet content by a large margin, and I would be cutting myself down severely were I to limit myself only to webcomics and the like of a British origin.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean really, these are obvious answers. It then begs the question: why would you ask such of me when the answers are so obvious?  The answer to that seems pretty clear too: You folk just want an excuse to hate on me for having a view opposed to your own, even if I am in no way attacking anyone with the expression of my views.  <br/> 
It is simple communal viciousness on your (plural) part that makes you question my presence... and likewise the basic rule that a larger number of people are always of lower mind than a lesser number that results in everything anti-me being chubbied and everything I post being lamed.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But feel free to disagree if you wish.

      your totally right. 'spanish' isn't even a language, it's Castilian, or one of the other 5 different languages that come from spain. and as a child of Latin American parentage.

      One other possible conclusion is that sometimes you might have the wrong idea about something. Not saying that's the case here, but if you regularly find yourself berated by a large number of people, while it is possible they're just dumb masses, it is also possible that you might maybe be wrong about something, and could ponder that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Again, this may or may not be the case here. If you see a pattern of victimizing yourself in the face of opposition, investigate the cause of that.

      I assume this is just based on the very popular Mexican epithet "¡Chinga tu madre!"   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Since we're discussing the meaning and usage of words, does anyone know if "chingar" is actually used outside of Mexico?  It's not really part of my working Spanish vocabulary, because most of my Spanish I learned in Spain.

      Mine either.  My Spanish is Venezuelan and Joder is used more often for both fucking and screwing.  Chingar is far less prolific.

      Most of my admittedly limited Spanish was learned with an emphasis on Mexican Spanish, since given the demographics of my area that's the variant most likely to be used. "Chingar" seems to be used to pretty much the complete exclusion of "joder," although the Mexican population has a large number of other cuss words, some of which are rather impressive in their complexity. When I have spent time in Spain, however, I have never once heard "chingar" or any variant thereof. It seems to be fairly equivalent to calling someone a "spanner" or a "tosser" versus calling them a douchebag; people who speak the language anywhere know what it means but one is far less common.

      I know his is a reallly old thread, but it confuses me. I live in Arizona and spend a lot of time around Mexicans, and this phrase is completely authentic. I hear chinga this, chinga that all day long. It does mean "fuckin'", conceptually if not literally. Do Mexicans not say this south of the border?
