      To be fair, Penny Arcade is often a much better comic if you cut off the last panel.  Try it sometimes, it is like nature intended. <br/>

Everyone else, just go back to reading XKCD.

      Sometimes I think Penny Arcade is a pretty misunderstood comic. I mean, it can get pretty surreal, almost to an Achewood level sometimes, and if it's not surreal, it's usually subversive. I get the feeling people are kind of instantly dismissive of it because it's about video games, never mind the fact that it's really fucking witty, incredibly consistent and absolutely gorgeous to look at. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't play video games, but PA is still one of my favourite comics because it is good enough to transcend game-geekdom.

Could be two doubles, though.  <br/>

      No, "bikes" is on the middle because it was the first play, although we can't be sure which letter Lyle put on the actual double word tile so you can't really figure out where the other two would actually fall.  If he put the "k" on the middle tile, then he would have 22 points, Teodore would have 17, and Mr. Bear would have 16.  Not the tremendous play it seems as it also no opens the double word square immediately above the "A" for Lyle's next play.  The real comedy here is that Lyle is better at Scrabble than Teodore and Mr. Bear.

      I thought the joke here was that neither Lyle nor Teodor know that you're supposed to begin from the middle square, hence Mr. Bear's "illegal". But now that I think about it, that doesn't explain why they would look surprised in the last panel.

      I remember Onstad mentioning that this strip generated more hatemail than anything he had created.  And I believe he said this well after this strip first ran.

      Here's the thing. The people who hated the Star Wars prequels most were the most hardcore fans of the original trilogy. Making that relate to Assetbar, just because we're fans of Achewood doesn't mean we have to pretend that every single strip is hilarious and a touchstone of our generation. Onstad has made this comic his  <em>job</em> , he doesn't need us to constantly remind him he's good at it. We should be able to say negative things without being lamed into another dimension. <br/>

My name is Deusoma, and I proudly admit that I don't like this.  <br/>

I've said my peace, you can bury me in lames now.

      I think that the punchline for this strip is way simpler than the scoring or who is browbeating who with what words on a scrabble board. I think it simply is that it led within 3 plays to the term 'illegal ghost bikes' which is pretty fricken' awesome. Onstad is chock full of things exactly like this. where he brings terminology out of his brain recesses and shares them with us. and so much of it sticks and becomes part of why Achewood is a cult classic webcomic for us all.
