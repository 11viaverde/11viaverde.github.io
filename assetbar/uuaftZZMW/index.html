      I can't believe noone else has commented on this. It is an awesome little show that is clearly practiced beforehand. I would bet that this is not the first time they have done it eather.

      Okay, here's a challenge. Drive down the road holding your hand against your head. It's not actually that challenging is it? <br/> 
Bluetooth headsets only make you think you're able to drive while having a conversation, whereas tests have proven that they cause a greater degree of impairment than most inebriation. <br/> 
:gets down from soap box: <br/> 
Er, sorry about that, I've just had too many close calls recently and my nerves've become jangled. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I agree with squi, as I can express only vexation at the distaste towards headsets. My cell phone is thin and svelte, but many smartphones are especially chunky, they can be annoying to hold up to your ear (being designed with headset or speakerphone use in mind), and get the fancy screen smudged. And no matter how light the phone, long conversations can just get wearying on the arms.

      My distaste for them is essentially, "How do you need to buy little things for your cell phone, how is that worth anything at all." I have little use for cell phones aside from emergencies.

      I guess I use mine as my sole primary phone, and often arrange meetings and such on them, so we're coming at it from different points of view. <br/> 
Note I don't have a bluetooth headset, and probably wouldn't use it in public just to avoid being thought crazier than I am already, I just don't see the problem with them. <br/> 
(Excepting people who believe they solve the problem of driving impairment by divided attention. That's still a problem.)

      Here's my problem with talking on a mobile whilst driving: often, someone will ask me a question, which will be followed by a thirty second pause, then a "Wait, what did you say?" <br/>

It's not that I'm not paying attention to the road. It's that I'm not paying attention to the conversation.

      Part of the problem is that the dude on the phone cannot see what is going on, so unlike a passenger, he does not know when to shut up.  <br/> 
(Some study found that having a passenger talk to you in the car actually increases your level of concentration. Incredibly counter-intuitive, but true.)
