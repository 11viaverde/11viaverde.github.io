      I have skipped my high school reunions so far.  Every time it has come up, I've had this flashback to ninth grade English class.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
We had this completely awful teacher.  Whenever a point of grammar came up, she would send this one student (the same guy every time) off to ask the eighth grade English teacher what the answer was.  Our teacher was wrong every time.  She couldn't spell, either.  Perhaps that was why spelling tests counted for 80% of our grades. <br/> 
 <br/> 
She also brought a special sense of utter unfairness to everything in the classroom, usually flavored with her religious views.  On a creative writing assignment, some friends of mine wrote papers with a Dungeons & Dragons theme.  She gave them all grades of zero because their writing was satanic.  (This was a public school; the administrators were bad, too, so the grades stuck.)   <br/> 
 <br/> 
In another instance, she got annoyed with the girl who sat in front of and her friend, who sat on the other side of room.  They were always talking all the way through the bell, so she made a new rule:  If you were not in your seat when the bell rang, you'd get kicked out of class.  The next day, several of us walked into class just before the bell, and were still getting to our seats when the bell rang.  She kicked us all out.  That was spelling test day, so we all got zeroes on that test.  My grade for the semester went from A-plus to C just from that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, the point is, one day she wanted to read us a story she had found, that she thought was really interesting and relevant to someone in our class.  It was about this guy who was regarded as a geek and a loser by his classmates.  He's super-intelligent, but unattractive and unpopular.  Years later, some of them see him on the street with this incredibly beautiful woman; he's obviously got money and style to burn now.  They somehow learn they shouldn't have treated him like an outcast back when.  She finishes the story and asks doesn't that sound familiar.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And she looks right at me.  And everyone in the class turns around and looks right at me.  And I'm just sitting there glaring at all of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Later that year, she got pregnant, and one of my friends said he wanted to abort her with a fork.  I thought that was extreme.  Then she had a miscarriage.  None of us ever spoke again about what was said before, but I don't think anyone felt the outcome was bad for the human race.

      Our high school's 10 year reunion was a bust.  We received TWO separate invitations for TWO separate dates.  One fellow, a former popular jock, took it upon himself to form a splinter 10 year reunion committee because he apparently disagreed with the idea of having the reunion during  <em>homecoming</em> .  So, he "proposed" having the reunion during the summer instead.  And by proposed, I mean he sent out separate invitations to the 550 members of our senior class.  Needless to say, the confusion was not resolved in time for the actual date. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Only 10 people showed up for the 10 year reunion.  I was not among the 10, who (no surprise) were all members of the  <em>bona fide</em>  reunion committee.  I just happened to run into some of the attendees the next day at breakfast and got the story. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have no idea what misery ensued on the 20th.

      Wait a sec, if the earth's rotational speed is slowing, then days are getting longer.  After all it would take a day (time it takes for the Earth to rotate once on its axis) of 364 1/4 * 24 = 8742 Hours to result in the same face (the "hot side") always towards the sun. <br/>

      I wasn't intending to say that Tekende wasn't allowed to enjoy the hell out of them, it was aimed more at people who would dismiss fortune cookies. I was merely attempting to defend them. <br/>

Basically my point is that they're kind like, well, every other cookie. Are you thinking that a dry, hard, crumbly, unpleasant Chips Ahoy! compares in any way to a soft, melty homemade chocolate chip cookie straight out of the oven with a tall, frosty glass of bovine secretion? Same deal here man. Don't knock it 'til you've had a chance to taste them at the top of their game.

      Assetbar folks may find this of interest since you mentioned "bovine secretion".  I recently experimented with so-called "raw" milk.  This is milk that has not been Pasteurized.  The difference is profound.  Unpasteurized milk is what made milk famous.  I am totally hooked on raw milk.  If I go two days without, I start jonesing bad.  In the modern world Pasteurization is simply a way for milk producers to take total crap milk and make it so that it doesn't kill you right after you drink it.  Doesn't mean that it isn't killing you slowly - it is!  Raw milk on the other hand is why way back in the day they called paradise the "land of milk and honey."

      BTW, it is against Federal Law to cross state lines with raw milk.  That is why I have to drive half an hour each way every two weeks to buy my raw milk.   <br/>

See?  They start with cocaine and heroin, and the next thing you know, cow's milk is illegal too.  Are we all slaves?  You all slaves.

This all reminds me of an extreme vegan/new ager I worked with, who went on that whole raw vegetable only diet a few years back, and proceeded to get a gastro-intestinal infection and have (reportedly) the nastiest farts this side of the Missouri.  Luckily, I never had to smell one. <br/>

      What's really fantastic about a number with a plus sign after it is that if you evaluated that in Haskell, you would get a  <em>function</em>  which adds 18 to things.  So you could write  <strong>map (18  ) [0, 1, 2]</strong>  and get [18, 19, 20]...  It's a great shorthand!

      The Facebook/yearbook joke is one that has been told countless times across the globe, with just as much precision as displayed here because really, when you get down to it, there's only one way to tell it.

      I'm not thrilled with it, but any strip that gets us away from the Wales arc is a step in the right direction. That whole thing was basically physically pushing me away from Achewood.

      so what's your source on these ideas about rape?  It's pretty hard to make universal assumptions about something that is to a large extent shaped by culture.  E.g. South Africa has one of the highest incidents of rape in the world because it is to a significant degree a culturally normalized phenomenon over there.  And yes you can obviously trace the origins to the repression and violence and dehumanization that accompanied apartheid.  Interestingly enough, when you consider that violence has been conclusively linked to sexual arousal in many individuals, the study of South Africa only seems to verify this link.

      I'm posting a meta-comment instead of the comment I was originally intending, because I just spent 5 minutes on Google searching for rape jokes to post here, and all I got was a bevy of articles on how rape jokes are bad and not funny and you should never tell them. How are we supposed to know they're not funny if they won't at least give us some examples?

      I'm toying with the idea of blocking your comments in future. The part of me which wishes to read and know everything that is going on, so as not to fail to understand some assetbar response or miss out on a moment, may eventually lose out to the part of me that deeply resents the effort required to read your posts, both for their appalling disregard for spelling, grammar and punctuation, and for their general content, which oscillates between vapid, tasteless, infantile and just plain a waste of time. You probably don't care, and you have no reason to, but I thought I would post it on the off-chance that it is all some relatively subtle post-modern ironic joke persona which I missed the inception/signs of, rather than the distinct possibility that your posts are a waste of webspace.

      Well jimmyk if you have and can post for us the definitive formula that delineates the line between art and schlock, we'd all love to see it! <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are many forms of humor.  One thing that makes humor funny is that offending someone or hurting their feelings...  Often when we laugh at a comedian, we're not laughing at the performance so much as we are laughing at the reaction (actual or predicted) of some audience...  E.g. satire, such as Carlin would perform, was and is funny, because it made a certain group of people look like the ass-hats that they were and are...  What makes you laugh is when you imagine the reaction of the audience, when you imagine the audience getting pissed off, embarrassed, confused, emotionally hurt, by having their ideas attacked by the clever satire.  Often the satire it's self is not inherently funny without the group to be offended by it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
AS long as it is remotely possible for someone to read between the lines of gladi8orrex's posts and perceive some kind of alternate and more genuine meaning, that someone will perceive these posts as humor, all the more so when people (like you) convey their annoyance at these same posts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's right, I said it.  Humor is often technically indistinguishable from trolling.  Trolling is merely humor with which someone disagrees...  e.g. Reagan probably took his Afgan freedom fighters seriously, so he would have been less likely to see the humor in it when Carlin pointed out that if firefighters fight fire... and crime fighters fight crime... then... what do freedom fighters fight? <br/>

      I don't necessarily disagree with you - much of modern humour is offensive. Hell, I love dead baby jokes as much as the next guy. And some trolls are hilarious. Colbert is almost the TV equivalent of a troll, directly parodying idiots like Limbaugh etc. (although I recently read an interesting article that states that a poll revealed many Republicans love Colbert and think he is on their side). I don't have a problem with assetbarians posting offensive humour - I'm a Dr. Manflesh fan. But Glad's posts just intrinsically fail to be funny for me (or, presumably, the 4 people who chubbied my analysis) and furthermore, the text speak makes them intolerably arduous to read. If you're classifying them as satire, then there's nothing intelligent, original or really worthwhile about them at all. If it's satire on trolling, it's been done... to death... and much better and funnier. So what really is it achieving?

      quote a poll revealed many Republicans love Colbert and think he is on their side /quote <br/> 
 <br/> 
yeah I would believe that they would think that, because many republicans are illiterate, and so can't distinguish parody and sarcasm from seriousness when it hits them in the face with a 2x4.  Of course, same goes for many democrats too.  anywho. <br/> 
 <br/> 
to try to answer the question you pose, yeah, the text speech of gladi is offensively annoying, and that is a big part of what some people find funny.  It's no different than when Andy Kaufman would do a character in a foreign accent...  He's forcing the audience to make an extraordinary effort to understand what it is he's trying to communicate.  The accent (spoken, or written as it were) is ridiculous.  And yet, people try to suspend disbelief and get past it.  Once they get past the ridiculous layer of accent, and they understand what's actually being said, it's the linguistic equivalent of a pie in the face, because what's being said is more often than not asinine.  Woven into the idiocy and the insanity are threads of coherence... just enough to take your cognition on a roller-coaster ride of unexpected twists and turns.  If it was pure 100% unadulterated idiocy and offensiveness, it wouldn't be funny.  Many would argue that it is 100% idiocy, but that just means that you don't have quite the perspective necessary to perceive the threads of coherence in the schitzoid spaghetti morass of idiocy.  The necessary perspective is a combination of intelligence, creativity, and world-view.  I say intelligence not in a condescending way but in a matter-of-fact 'some people can solve certain kind of problems better than others can' sort of way because it does take a certain problem-solving ability to be able to see patterns of recursively meta ideas in a mess that is almost indistinguishable from white noise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So what can I say... if Gladi's humor is not funny, that's one thing.  If it's more than boring, if it's actively annoying, then it achieves some purpose, and it is and will be humor to someone somewhere.  I don't think it's satire on trolling...  The concept of satire conjures some sort of wit and intellectual intelligence, but, it seems that Gladi operates on a more visceral and instinctive level.  Gladi is working with a limited repertoire.  He's not dealing in the vast landscape of proprietary political ideas that are peculiar to a time or place, instead he's exploring more universal concepts (gender and race and ego) and he's exploring these concepts closer to their point of origin in the human heart.  In this respect his relatively basic speech and vocabulary is actually of benefit to his endeavor.  <br/>

      Face it man, no matter how much you act like you want to you're never going to be all that interested in rape culture. You'll go to one gangbang and pass it off with how sophisticated you are and that's probably going to be it unless a girlfriend pressures you to do it in the future.

      Her entire image seems to be based around the idea that she does not appear to be legal and yet she wishes for you to make the bone with her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yet, oddly, she apparently is legal. Truly France has succeeded where the rest of us have failed. Russia could not make it work with their fake lesbian duo Tatu, everyone saw Britney Spears'  <em>cunni</em>  well after anyone would actually want to do so and when we finally did see it were horrified. <br/>

      A preference for neotenic (youthful) features has been the driving force behind Human evolution for the past hundred thousand years. Being desirous of non-sloping foreheads and upright posture eventually went overboard, as all sexual selection eventually does, and now we have pedophilia, which can probably be explained as the logical endpoint of this sort of natural selection, as at its extreme, it selects for members of the species that are not reproductively functional.

      Another factor that increases the extent to which people are pedophiles and for that matter preference of skinny bitches over moderately fat chicks is the fact that people are programmed by their environment, and the information float has collapsed, (meaning more information is more rapidly accessible) thereby significantly increasing exposure to the aspects of our information environment which program us.

      Are you basically saying we take the natural preference for younger (and therefore likely to be more fertile and extend the species) womenfolk to the extreme because it's what works and then that preference will be exhausted at a certain point and some other characteristic will take over?  Because that makes sense.

      Scrolling quickly past the Hoff and his orange skin gives that 'butcher-shop window' effect that's normally associated with half-glimpsed 70s porn. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The effect is enhanced by the wrinkled, folded dog skin in the centre of the pic (and the centre of the Hoff). Brrrrr! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hope he's not contemplating an Isosceles Lock with the puir wee hounds.

      Her "smile" scares me, but you can see her nipples. Granular Silica is correct, it seems like the sort of thing where you really had to be there. I presume that while there is no singularly iconic poster to celebrate it Cindy Crawford had a similar effect on my own generation. Not really thought of that much anymore, but she was kind of omnipresently hot at the time. Not sure it makes sense to the kids these days though. I shudder to think what they are poppin wood to now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hmm... is this even really a thing? I mean, with ominipresent porn access are suggestive pin-ups even remotely an issue for today's youth?

" <em>The unidentified bus driver opined that "Michael Jackson should have been in jail long ago," prompting Kiernan, 60, to retort that "the world just lost a great musical talent," the police report said.<br/>
<br/>
It said the last remark enraged another passenger, Henry Wideman, who started a swearing match with Kiernan, then pulled out a knife and chased Kiernan down the aisle with it.</em> " <br/>

      That's the kind of asshole logic that assumes that women that claim rape are just manipulative extortionists.  Yes, people tried to take advantage of MJ with spurious allegations.  The fact that he fought the fake charges and paid off the others would lead a reasonable man to conclude that he was guilty when he paid.

      I don't know what he did, but the fact that he fought the weak cases and paid off the strong cases only means he took the path of least resistance. <br/>

Also, I can't believe you would blame your criticisms on "he's a pedophile" when you've already said Roman Polanski was forgivable because you liked his work. <br/>

MJ helped music suck and his antics drowned out more important news stories. He's a symbol of narcissism and dysfunction. Nice Pete once said "That guy creeps me out." He was probably a shitty father, but I haven't looked it up. See? There's plenty of reasons to hate him without making stuff up.

      I remember that the cover story for NYC papers on 9/11/01 was about a 1970's era hijacker that was caught the day before.  He had come back into the country and had dedicated his like to teaching at-risk children in the ghetto (until they matched his teacher fingerprint file against the FBI data). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know whether it was a bad day to be picked-up as a hijacker, or a good day to have been an old-school political hijacker that didn't harm anyone and dedicated his life to good causes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For some reason there was little coverage after the 11th.

      Someone made a facebook group "I have died."  what strange power Onstad has.  He writes it, and it becomes real.  Except that presumably all the people in "I have died" are actually alive.

      I am sorry that I was a dick-head to mensch in the jacko thread higher up <br/> 
 <br/> 
~~ <br/> 
 <br/> 
my thought for the moment is that I don't like to be in the same room as a television when it is turned "on" because televisions always seem to be impolite then never seem to know how to take turns talking they always interrupt you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
~~ <br/> 
 <br/> 
my thought about Michael Jackson is why does Onstad have to care about Michael Jackson why doesn't we care about Iraq or Iran or something.  I think that Michael Jackson would have wanted us to talk about the unloved hungry children in the world instead of talk about him.  You got to admit that even if you do believe that Michael Jackson did slip into a pedophilia now and again, except for the pedophilia part, he was an okay guy who had his priorities straight a lot more than most people.  Most pedophiles aren't doing no work to help the starving children.  Are you?

      My thoughts exactly. To be frank, I believe Onstad's late obsession with plethora-paneled strips is counter-productive. It not only slows production, but by design greatly reduces the number of comedic  <em>coup d'etats</em>  he can run with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 The second row of the preview is an absolute marvel in itself.

      I don't think it's a purposeful thing.  I don't think he sits down and says "I'm gonna make 12 panels of Ray listening to Ramses yell at a cop in his phone."  I think he sets out with the idea, and then it grows, and anyone who's done anything creative knows (or at least in my case), once you put something down, you're reluctant to remove it (unless you know it's bad but sometimes even that won't matter).  His style is changing, I think, is the safest thing to say.  That doesn't make it any less counter-productive, as you say, unless Onstad feels he's working at a higher caliber than before, because at the end of the day he's still the artist and his opinion should be considered alongside those of the legions of disgruntled Achewood fans who want a 6 panel comic a day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said, I think whatever he ends up posting as the final MJ comic result won't be better than the first two tiers.  My suggestion that won't be considered is to split it between days and make a mini arc (2 or 3 comics) out of it.  Tomorrow's can start with Beef from outside the window: "Uh hey T dogg what is the deal I mean you acting like in the main crazed."

Lady Snail is on the witness stand, testifying about being raped by the two defendants, both Turtles. <br/> 
"I don't know"...she says. "It all happened so fast!" <br/>

OK....a rapist is dragging his hott blonde captive deep into the woods. <br/> 
It's a dark and stormy night. <br/> 
Thunder claps, lightning flashes. <br/> 
She looks up at him and whimpers "Mister, I'm Scared!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
He replies "YOU'RE scared?..... <br/> 
....I gotta walk back out of here alone!" <br/>

      it's interesting that my Achewood Jacko comic strip mashup of between-the-lines subversiveness a few posts up gets 4 lames and counting, yet my assemblage of rape jokes basically gets ignored.  Conclusion:  Assetbarians are a sensitive bunch and easily offended, but only when it comes to stuff that they don't understand or that provokes any sort of thought.  "Let's keep Assetbar as puerile as possible" they all chant in unison.  What can I say...  Gladdi is not a walking museum of modern art, but he's certainly 10,000% more interesting than the average boob on assetbar. <br/>

      ya, I'd say that basically the spasmodic young kids on assetbar and the more stable personas of the 40 and 50 year olds are pretty much for the most part all the same... mostly just kinda ethnocentric and self-absorbed. <br/>

      It is an unfortunate fact that Chris Onstad's soul is bound in ways inexplicable to the act of creating this comic.  It is his nature, though, to try resist - to try to have a life outside of a creation whose admirers pray for it night and day around the world. <br/> 
Sadly for him, he can never escape this obligation.  It will be his life's journey to overcome this and learn to love writing achewood again.

      Or that.  I honestly wouldn't mind a three or six paneler every other day.  Most of the other webcomics I read do that anyway, and the consensus seems to be that two tiered one-offs are preferred.

      Agreed. I'd rather be surprised by a new comic every few days than disappointed when it's late. I feel bad for Onstad when he doesn't make the deadlines he sets for himself.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In a way, he's kind of like MJ. He just wants his fans to be happy. I just hope he doesn't wind up in a hyperbolic chamber with the Elephant Man.

      I think someone was just pissed off that Ed McMahon was getting attention for the first time in twenty years that didn't have something to do with debt.  <br/> 
I mean I care that people have died, but the only one that really upsets me is Ed. It's hard work being a sidekick, especially to a great comedian like Johnny Carson; always having to make the guy like good even when he was off, always playing second fiddle, diverting the limelight to someone else and being completely cool about it. Lesser men would have crumbled under the responsibility, unable to maintain the humility and selflessness that embodies being a sidekick.
