      i played diplomacy with some friends once.  sam and i decided to team up and take out everybody else.  we did this, but during one of the final rounds of negotiation, i managed to maneuver sam outdoors, and proceeded to lock the door.  i returned to the group and told everybody sam had to go home suddenly, and that as such, he forfeited the game, and i won. <br/> 
 <br/> 
by the time i remembered sam was out there, it was too late for anybody to refute me, everything had been cleaned up.

      That seems the most likely explanation.  When Beef imagines things it never ends happily for anyone.  He doesn't want the mouse to fall to its death, but it's  <em>his job</em> .

      Like a lot of laboratory experiments or measurements, you start with a large tool and end with a precise tool.   Start buy dumping liquid into a graduated cylinder until you're near your goal, and finish with with individual drops from a pipet.  Start with a hammer, finish with tweezers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now I wish I could imagine the point of this experiment.  The rats don't look like they're being killed.

      Wow, it's interesting to see you guys' immediate reaction to this strip. My thought was that Beef is supposed to kill all those rats (the worst job for a lab assistant that he can think of, and with the worst tools,) it doesn't work of course, one rat hangs on to the edge of the table, and Beef doesn't want to touch it. Since it's his job to kill it, he tries to pull it back up with the tweezers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I always thought this strip was really sad. Reflects a lot of Beef and how he sees tragedy in everything, and from the utmost pessimistic point of view.

      Not sure where I heard it, but when you need to put down a rat from an experiment, they do it in what is called The Mouse Room (this maybe specific to one particular lab). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Which is kinda species-ist, but if you're going off to die I'm guessing that's going to be the last of your complaints.

      A fall like that won't kill a mouse, though.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
We presume the ones that ran off the table are alive and well and escaped, don't we? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm seeing an act of compassion for the mouse, even if it's expressed via tweezers. I'm guessing Beef is either shaking paws or loosening the mouse's grip so he drop down and run off with his fellows.

      I would venture a guess that the curved lines around the mouse indicate that it is shaking.  And if that is true, I would guess that it is about to suffer a terrible fate.  I would assume that fate to be: listening to the cure, endlessly.

      I'd like to imagine a scenario where the hanging mouse had been bullied by the rest of the mice.  Beef, having likely been similarily picked on at some point in his past, sympathized and took it upon himself to torment the bully mice with the hammer, allowing him to exact vengeance upon his childhood bullies, vicariously.  My theory.

      It's rare that I feel this way, because I really do love the blogs. But I can't tell you how much I wish Onstad would've made Beef's "ol' lead balloon" entry into a strip, instead. I think it's unfair that I'll never get to see his vision of Ray doing the "bird is the word" dance in full scuba gear at the bottom of his pool. <br/>

I don't know. Maybe it would've been hard to convey properly.

      Wow. People's interpretations of this strip are a lot darker than mine. I read it as "Beef has to hit the mice with a hammer, they all run away immediately except one, he feels fellow-feeling for the only person left in the room with him, they shake hands."

      Okay, but why does he have a tweezers handy in his shirt pocket from the very first panel?  Was he planning to shake hands? <br/>

Cats persecuting mice is a little too reminiscent of the ethnic assignments to different animals in "Maus", which makes me feel like RB/Ray/etc. are Nazis and I guess Cornelius is Russian.  Philippe, of course, is an otter.
