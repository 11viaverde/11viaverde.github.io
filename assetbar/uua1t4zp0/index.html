The comment is so awesome that it spawns religious cults that in 20 years time will have schismed due to disagreement over whether Ross was using Red or Blue crayons.... and David Schwimmer will finally pee his pants and complete his death of shame.  <br/>

That being said, acting like Friends was one of the worst things in TV's history is like saying Gerald Ford was one of the worst dictators in history.  He wasn't exactly world-class but I'll be damned if all the falling down didn't make me laugh once in a while.

      You may have Gerald Ford, the star of the U of M football team with two undefeated seasons and arguably the best athlete ever to be U.S. President, confused with Chevy Chase, who watched Ford trip once and turned it into an SNL shtick. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, the entire cast of  <em>Friends</em>  is a mechanical dog that balances a wooden nickel on its nose.

      Did Ford ever win anything when he was president?  No (not even his presidency). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Gerald Ford was an old man when he was president; even old athletes can be clumsy.   <em>This is almost certainly true.</em>   And he fell at least 2 times on camera, I believe,  <em>so there</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, my comment was obviously facetious, as you can tell by my age (which is approximately correct), I'm not old enough to have ever seen Ford fall enough in person to get chuckles out of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That being said, as much as I disagree with Friends on so many levels, it's really just stupid to say it was never funny.  I've seen numerous bits and pieces of episodes while a roommate has watched it, and I was surprised at how well-written and genuinely funny the jokes could be at times.  Too bad I hate the cast and the premise of the show in general. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Why, it's almost like Michigan: I hate the atheletic program in general, especially the football team, but I'd just be a fool if I didn't admit they put a good team out there with some regularity.

Yeah, I shouldn't really have mentioned those people by user-name. 2/3 of those people are OK at times, also, ( <em>amazingly stupid comment approaching...</em> ) how exactly do you set your preferences to hide comments with a certain number of lames?

      You can change how many lames it take to hide a lamed comment (and, if you want, how many chubbies it takes to make a comment highlighted) thusly: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Go to the top of the page.  Under the strip, there's the green "Post a Comment" box...right under that, there's the options to change the amount of chubbies/lames.  When you choose your number, hit "Save."  I'm one of the people who have their lame limit set at 5000.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And as you may have seen, you can change this limit to "1" and then find out who lamed your comment, if you want.  And, there is a post for Asherdan that, last time I checked (last week), only had one lame.  It actually had 0 until a month or two ago...I made the mistake of pointing out in a comment that it only had one lame, and so someone promptly lamed it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The ignore option always seems odd to me, because most posters worth putting on ignore will almost always generate huge reply threads anyways...

 Yeah, commenting that a Asherdan comment doesn't have lames is like the friggin' bat-signal. <br/> 
 Well, now I have my lame limit set gooood and high but if I see blatant insulting crap or a reeaaally long manflesh post that is what the ignore button is for me. Not saying the dude isn't hilarious occasionally. But I didn't really want to see that Calvin and Hobbes fan-fiction he wrote... Oh, and have a chubby for explaining.
