      Funny you should ask. I don't think it normally is, but the very friend of mine who inspired me to coin the phrase* actually does have one of those. He justifiably gets away with it because it says in bold letters "FUDGE IS MADE." You get the full glory of it when he turns around to face you and you see that under each nipple is tattooed the word "MILK" and tattooed just above his pants line is "LEMONADE." The fact that he still gets it on with the fine ladies in spite of (and in some cases  <em>because</em>  of) this is what makes him a hobosexual and not just a sad freak. <br/> 
 <br/> 
* - I'm under no illusion that I'm the first person in the world to say this, but I can say in all honesty that I didn't hear or read it anywhere before I started saying it. I consider it mine in that way.

      It's one of life's tragedies that fedoras aren't acceptable unless you live in the past, or are fictional. You flirt with the idea of looking cool while wearing one, but no. The best you can hope is to look like a guy who wants to look cool. <br/>

      There is nothing wrong with a fedora. It just depends on what else you're wearing. T-shirt and jeans? No. Slacks, nice shirt, and jacket? Probably. Suit? Definitely. Also fedoras go well with trenchcoats/dusters.

      I'm steadfast in my belief that one must ask himself only one question when trying to decide whether or not to don a fedora in public - "Am I under forty years of age?" If the answer comes back "yes," one really should reconsider. There are just some styles that you have to earn by staying alive forty years. I have never seen anyone under that age look good in a fedora. I have never seen anyone over that age look bad in one.

      I think the inspiration for the first burn may be Alton Brown. When he did that Feasting on Asphalt show he definitely rode a Honda Goldwing (which he managed to fall off and injure himself) and I could see him wearing a dorky fedora and collecting swords. <br/>
