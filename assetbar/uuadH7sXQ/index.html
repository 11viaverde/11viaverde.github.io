      I must admit, New Tina's a lot funnier than Old Tina (so far). She seems like a low-class female Ray. Still doubting her validity as a long-term character, but I should know better than to second-guess Onstad by now. Plus I'm always sayin' how this strip needs some more lady characters.

      "A low-class female Ray"? This description implies that Ray could possibly be described as high-class. Ray is and has been many things, but "classy" has never been nor never will be one of them.

      Well, she lived in Poland at first, but after she was running across all of Europe. And actualy, there's an amazing story about that: She and a group of people were running and had to find somewhere to hide, so they fled to the basement of an abandoned house. When the Nazis came shortly afterward, they took one look in the doorway and left, because in that short time between their hiding and the Nazis' arrival, a spider had spun a web across the whole doorway, and obviously, if anyone hed entered the room, the spiderweb would have been broken, right? So that's how she survived and that's why my family doesn't kill spiders.

      Depends on the age and what exactly she's wearing. There's a fine line between sexy and trying too hard. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's also the Playboy Advisor column where a dude mentioned that he had issues with his girlfriend in her early twenties, IIRC, wanting to wear her actual old school uniform that still fit her well. I think the dude claimed to have issues with having gone to Catholic school or something crazy, but it feels more like he should have directed something that fake at the Penthouse Forum because if he's not bragging about how he's turning that down he's just wishing he would ever have the option available.

      Yeah, knee socks or some cute above-the-knee or thigh high socks are totally awesome. So are, of course, various forms of hosiery except for pantyhose because those are both straight-up creepy and they get in the way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In a few cases a girl can pull off other kinds of socks or even shoes (boots being a given, but cheap stripper heels are just nasty) if it fits the look and such otherwise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My girlfriend, however, likes to sleep in socks. I also find it odd that someone would wear underwear beneath pajamas. If you're taking it that far and wearing maybe pants and a shirt of some type you're basically just still fully dressed albeit in what may very well be crappy, ugly clothes. That is so not acceptable.

      I interpreted this thread differently from just about everyone else. When Ray said that "they let athletes wear leg warmers" i thought he was trying to say that he was an athlete and that he was wearing his socks on his penis just before he boned Tina, to make sure he stayed warm [just like how athletes try to prevent the muscle contracting from cooling.]  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I soon realized that I had interpreted the strip wrong from Onstad's intention but I like to think I laughed harder. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you apply that interpretation (where socks are worn on the penis) to some comments posted: <br/>

Wearing socks during sex is hella weird. I tried once and I had to take them off (it was awkward)  <br/>

      It looks extremely unappealing. Really and truly. It's OK to disbelieve, but the polls are pretty unanimous on this one. I sincerely suggest you take off your socks in the presence of a New Lady. You can roll them off as you remove your trousers, all Undercover Brother like.

      Well, it's like Teodor is looking for a reaction to what he said, and Rau is looking either like, why did you ask about her? or, what should I say about this touchy subject.  I mean, there are pauses like that in a lot of conversations.

      It's a very meaningful pause. Teodor's thinking "did I overstep the mark there? Better check for a reaction"; Ray's thinking "damn, did T just insult me or was he being sincere? Do I need to get pissy about this", but in the end a confrontation is averted when Ray decides to humbly concede that Teodor's right about his fickleness, and the conversation carries on like nothing happened. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's how I read it, anyway.

      I think the joke here is that Ray believes himself so good at the sex act that its like an SAT allegory <br/>

a) sex <br/>
