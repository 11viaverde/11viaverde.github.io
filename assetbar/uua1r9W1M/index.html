      That is how I always feared that I would react to the dreadful responsibility of making the first post. Language centre of the brain all failing, hands all flailing at the keyboard in the hopes of somehow conveying my enthusiasm and making use of an amusing irreverancy without sounding too self-possessed.

      This is an intelligent post. The best advice one can give for the first post, like the metaphorical meat dildo, is to not break the seal unless it is for something truly gratifying and epic. A  <em>tour de force</em> . Failing that, one finds oneself dribbling piss into the urinal of life, and leaving moist the trousers of self respect.

      I had the chance to make the first post once. <br/> 
My hands started shaking, heart-rate tripled, vision failed... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Long story short, I woke up two weeks later on the coast of Brazil with a tattoo reading "lol, Ray is so funy", and a deep sense of dissatisfaction.

      Those that make the first post see into a dark city filled with horrific, chittering shapes, far beyond the edge of reason, where eldritch gods lie dreaming of a horrific world where they rule, or at least can get a decent pie and chips. <br/>

It is no wonder they who see this go mad, as can be seen by how lame their post is.

I did it in sheer panic and when I was finished I actually left the room. I knew if I sat in a room with a computer I would just hit F5 over and over again, pleading for the approval of people from the internet. I think I skated by with being fairly ignored except for eight people. Whoever they are, may the sun always shine on their children's heads, unless they're really fair-skinned.

It is the basic, top-level comic so you have to click through.  It is worth it though because this is probably the most intelligently worded first post in the archives.

      When it happened to me, I imagined Chris Onstad himself choosing me for the honor of first post. I thought that maybe he had read my posts and was impressed, thought I had potential. He said to himself, "What the hell, I'll give the kid a shot at the limelight".  <br/>

      Same reason one might read the Youtube comments to a video featuring a band or singer that they like. Reason may have little to nothing to do with it.

      Actually, youtube's comments engine is quite possibly the only place online which is worse than assetbar, in terms of functionality. Combine this with the content and it makes posting on youtube a fruitless experience. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pretty much any comments system based on your posts being rated by all of the posters sucks ass and is shitty.

      Youtube comments  <em>can</em>  be entertaining. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the gladi8orrex kind of entertaining, minus the occasional puzzle and quip about a lack of trustworthiness from the chick from Sideways. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For instance, on "Zombie Kid Likes Turtles", there is a comment (the username of which I absolutely refuse to look up among 200,000 comments) stating: <br/> <br/> <br/> "lol why tutles thats not what the she askd ha" <br/> <br/> <br/> Comments like that get me every time.

      Davey-boy: eh, not really.  When I go to youtube, it's default is that the text comments are viewable; it's a little more tempting too look at them.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you got to achewood.com, you just get the strip.  Waddie apparently has made the effort to not only look at the discussions, but also made an account so that he could participate, if mostly through lames (as far as we can tell).   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's pretty easy to avoid Assetbar and still read Achewood, so I'm wondering why a guy who doesn't act overtly troll-ish is going through so much trouble for something he seemingly doesn't like. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't buy his reasoning (as it currently stands), and I think heccibiggs was perfectly justified in calling him out.

      Are you laming her hoping that people will start to post about the strip?  That is wishful thinking.  That is a pipe dream.  First off, you can't herd cats into focusing on that sort of thing on the internet.  Second, at this point most of the posters are here to chat with the community, not to talk about the strip.  The strip is an icebreaker, most people here just want to chat with each other.  Finally, I'm going to get lamed to hell for this, but there generally isn't that much to say about strips.  A few insightful comments (like, 3), a ton of people saying how cool a character or saying is (like 15), and a brick of people guessing about hidden meaning and future storyline (like, 10).  If we all stayed on topic, there would be even less signal to the noise, and far fewer comments. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We've got a good community here, few trolls, well defined personalities and/or characters, and skilled writers.  I personally wouldn't throw around my lames to punish people like Hecci for doing nothing harmful at all.  Hell, some of the better comments have come from bitching at a first-poster (Note: this is rare, usually whining about it just encourages it).

      You gonna have yourself one hell of a job if you consider the laming of every non-Achewood related comment on Assetbar your right and responsibility. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also: "I think posting comments merely so people can reciprocate is precisely the kind of attitude that leads to so many lame comments." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry to burst your optimistic little bubble, there, but that's the only reason anyone ever comments on anything. The strip itself does not beg some kind of answer or response, and its perfectly easy to have an opinion on the strip without feeling that a verbalisation of your feelings is also necessitated. Being that the first post on every strip logically precedes any point made by others, in making it the poster is only ever looking to gain some kind of reaction, positive or negative, from the other denizens of Assetbar. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm too tired to read through that again and see if it's overly pedantic. You be the judge.

      In Jonathan Swift's "Tale of a Tub"(1704), it was mentioned that "bread is the staff of life".  I don't know if this is the first recorded use of the term, but it's the oldest I know of.  It sounds like it could be a biblical term, but I can't find it anywhere on wikipedia, so I'm assuming not.

      The biblical phrase is "staff of bread," meaning the supply of bread.  God tends to use this phrase when he's threatening people.  With death.  This is, I think, where the idea of bread as the staff (support, supply) of life comes from. <br/>

      "They smell like come," said Simone, sniffing the unleavened wafers. <br/> 
"Precisely," continued Sir Edmond. "The hosts, as you see, are nothing other than Christ's sperm in the form of small white biscuits. And as for the wine they put in the chalice, the ecclesiastics say it is the  <em>blood</em>  of Christ, but they are obviously mistaken. If they really thought it was the blood, they would use red wine, but since they employ only white wine, they are showing that at the bottom of their hearts they are quite aware that this is urine." <br/> 
The lucidity of this logic was so convincing that Simone and I required no further explanation.

      If Jesus is the "bread of life" (John 6:35 [KJV]) and Bread is the "staff of bread" (as has been proven)then Jesus must be the Staff of Life.  Which means that Ramses is upset that the mixer is not powerful enough to pummel Jesus into a doughy, bakeable mixture. <br/>

      Futurama is way hella better then that Simpsons junk or any other cartoon ever created. It actually has a plot and character arcs. Boondocks I'm impartial to since it revolves around race jokes and as a black man I don't find too funny any more, except for the R. Kelly episode.

      I'd have to counter that McGruder takes a more unique approach to "racial"** commentary than most these days.  Racial humor thanks to retards like Mencia and Chappelle has literally become, "White people do this, Black people do  <em>this</em> ."  But I think the Boondocks uses this device to satirize itself.  I think more people would see this without contrast characters like Ruckus and the elder Wuncler.  But without the elder Wuncler, we don't get Ed jr and his Samuel L-voiced comrade. <br/>

**Far as I'm concerned, race is a social construct.

      For cheap gin, I've found a brand called New Amsterdam that is quite nice.  Not my favorite gin by a longshot, but it's $13 a bottle, smooth enough to drink on the rocks, and makes a passable martini.  In comparison with other spirits, I'd put it on par with Jim Beam bourbon, Christian Brothers brandy, or Charles Shaw wine, a far cry from the best, but far better than anything else you can get in its price range.

      Everything there is available in most liquor stores, except Charles Shaw wine, often referred to as "Three Buck Chuck", which is only available at Trader Joe's stores due to some sort of deal they have with the winery that makes it.  It's $3 a bottle and tastes better than most wines I've had in the <$15 price range.  I have, however, only drank the Shiraz and the Cabernet, so I don't know how any of the others are.

      If you want something completely palatable, and less than ten bucks, go Bogle.  I've had Chuck, and didn't go too wild about her.  Bogle Merlot and Bogle Chard are quite nice, and 8 or 9 bucks at most places.

      I'm glad I'm not the only one who was prompted to research the KitchenAid model lineup. <br/>

Perhaps they don't consider the 8-cup's basic 'C' design to be a real dough hook. The Pro 600-series has a "Burnished PowerKnead Spiral Hook", which sounds like something they'd prefer.

      Be kind of redundant. Ramses sees some fools, corrects their behavior, repeat. I guess the innovation would have to come from the manner in which he corrected them, finding new and fanciful ways to beat asses. Tear a man in half. Turn him into a marrionette with the man's own detatched tendons.

 <br/> 
Is this the real death- <br/> 
Is this just fantasy- <br/> 
Rose from a graveyard- <br/> 
No escape from reality- <br/> 
Open your eyes <br/> 
Look up to the skies and see- <br/> 
I'm just a zombie, I need no sympathy- <br/> 
Because I'm easy come, easy go, <br/> 
A little high, little low, <br/> 
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, <br/> 
To me <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mama, just ate a man, <br/> 
Put my teeth against his head, <br/> 
Ate his brain, now he's dead, <br/> 
Mama, undeath had just begun, <br/> 
But there's no way to throw it all away- <br/> 
Mama ooo, <br/> 
Didn't mean to make you die- <br/> 
If I'm still walking dead this time tomorrow- <br/> 
Carry on, carry on, because nothing really matters- <br/> 
 <br/> 
Too late, my time has come, <br/> 
Sends shivers down my spine- <br/> 
Body's numb all the time, <br/> 
Goodbye everybody-I've got to go- <br/> 
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth- <br/> 
Mama ooo- <br/> 
I didn't want to die, <br/> 
I sometimes wish I'd never come back at all- <br/> 
 <br/> 
I see a little silhouetto of a man, <br/> 
Scaramouche, scaramouche will you do the fandango- <br/> 
Thunderbolt and lightning-very backlighting me- <br/> 
Galileo, galileo, Galileo, galileo <br/> 
Galileo figaro-magnifico- <br/> 
But I'm just a zombie and nobody loves me- <br/> 
He's just a zombie, ate his whole family- <br/> 
Spare him his death from this monstrosity- <br/> 
Easy come easy go-will you let me die- <br/> 
Bismillah! no-we will not let you die-let him die- <br/> 
Bismillah! we will not let you die-let him die <br/> 
Bismillah! we will not let you die-let me die <br/> 
Will not let you die-let me die <br/> 
Will not let you die let me die <br/> 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no- <br/> 
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me die- <br/> 
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me- <br/> 
 <br/> 
So you think you can bite me and spit in my eye- <br/> 
So you think you can shoot me and leave me to die- <br/> 
Oh baby-can't do this to me baby- <br/> 
Just gotta get out-just gotta get right outta here- <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nothing really matters, <br/> 
Anyone can see, <br/> 
Nothing really matters-,nothing really matters anymore <br/> 
 <br/> 
Any way the wind blows....

      I think we agree Mr. whoisspain. <br/>

I'm not suggesting that they are mutually exclusive, merely that the other gentleman side exists, and that there is no need to explain this side of his character in relation to the death machine part.

      So I was right a few days ago. Here they claim this item is on the registry and they're looking at the Crate and Barrel registry. According to  <br/> 
https://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=05232008 <br/> 
the bride and groom are registered at Macy's and Templeton Psychiatric Services. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This must merely be a mistake. Because I was convinced that a man like Ramses would not be so crass as to order off the registry. Some commenters disagreed with me, but it is the truth that ordering off the registry is chancy at best despite what idiotic pile of crap cnn might be spewing today. <br/>

      It wasn't funny, it didn't really develop the characters, or portray any kind of truth. It was just stereotyical dialogue for one undeveloped character, and an excuse to make fun of welsh accents with the other. All it needed was a sheepsex joke to really show off the lack of creativity, and Onstad's weird lack of familiarity with people who aren't white non-hispanic, male americans.

      I found it funny that the tough guys didn't have the balls to face the store clerk again.  That would count as character development for Ramses, who heretofore has never shown weakness.  Also, both of them are somewhat befuddled by the unwritten rules that business has built up around weddings to make you overspend just to avoid embarrassment.  Wait, I meant etiquette, which any gentleman knows innately, and the propriety of which no right-thinking person would ever question. <br/>

      You don't think this displays anything at all new about Ramses?  I agree that the sheepfucker is just a foil, but seeing him actually make a mistake, and how he handles it, as well as his recognizing that Beef is cheap, doesn't say anything about his character?  Can I run that last sentence on any further? <br/>

      Well, he's mostly been referred to by other characters, as a romantic(ised) figure. I don't think we needed a whole cartoon of this dull dialogue, following two strips of him making a mistake, to establish that he is just a man (who is an uncanny fighter).

      Hispanic usually means anyone of both Spanish and Native American descent. Although I do know some people who are almost or totally completely white, who still call themselves hispanic because they or their parents are from latin America. It's a complicated term.

      I always associated Pat's dickishness with left leaning politics taken to the point of idiocy.   <br/>

I further extrapolate (I think based on an interview that I read) that Pat is how Onstad expresses his own liberal self-loathing. (i.e. he has sympathy for Pat's causes, but is uncomfortable with it, so he satirizes it.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
In other words, is there some evidence I am unaware of that Pat is a reublican?

      Come now, Tekende, can't you let us enjoy blunt political jabs without reading too much into it and starting one of these cycles? Now flazissismuss is going to post an explanation of why Republicans are dicks. In the midst of doing so he will refer to specific policies, at least one of which someone will take it upon themselves to defend, launching an entire subdiscussion on the subject. Then someone is going to jump in with something like "I thought liberals were supposed to be tolerant of everyone, doesn't that include Republicans?" Then someone else will post their very original thoughts on why all political parties are evil and self-interested and therefore you shouldn't identify with any of them. Interspersed among these comments will be lawbot going "YES" and "NO", but since thread recursion will have long reached its limit by this time, all comments will appear in a solid vertical line and it will be impossible to determine what he is replying to, thus making his comments even more worthless than usual. In a matter of minutes we'll have a 10-page skyscraper of boredom comparable only to the self-absorbed rantings of the multi-account douche, and I will once again be tempted into a self-imposed exile. Which might actually be good for everyone involved, so by all means let's proceed.

      I guess I just don't find mean-spirited blanket generalizations to be funny? And anyway, it isn't true and comes across as insulting and condescending.

      Pat is the sort of guy that will vote for either party, while simultaneously bitching at everyone within earshot about how much that party sucks.  He is (obviously) socially liberal, but far too Libertarian to not hate Democrats.  He is the guy that only complains about politics.  He would do well posting on this board.

      I think it is a common misconception that Pat ever  <em>intends</em>  to piss people off, no matter how good at it he is. Pat sees himself as the only good and reasonable man in a world full of juvenile idiots. <br/>

Come to think of it, Ray is possibly to blame for that.
