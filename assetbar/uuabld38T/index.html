      Thanks. I was trying to think of the most appropriate term and decided that rather with going with something more reasonable I should just go all-out and pick something that both explains what I want to say and would amuse by making me sound as out-of-touch as possible. <br/>

When you get down to it though, it becomes more self-reflexive because as uncool and unused as it is that really is the correct term we ought to be using.

      I'm for the legalization and taxation of substances such has tetrahydrocannabinol, psilocyben cubensis, and dimethyltryptamine.  These are naturally occurring substances, and in that respect they should be legal.  The taxation issue is a touchy one, but it makes the most sense in an American context.  Vegas runs a tax on prostitution, and that seems to be the right idea.  Those variables that we may consider undesirable should be legal, regulated, and taxed.  But that's  <em>this</em> \ guy's ideas.

I don't dream often. For a great many years I don't recall dreaming at all. I'm not even certain it's an issue of remembering as I have various sleep problems so I may not have been getting proper REM sleep much of the time or for long enough intervals to have proper dreaming.

true.  <br/>

baaaah. whatever. the truckloads of U.S. dollars that are getting shipped to Mexican drug cartels - de facto feeding a [yet another] 3rd world war -  would be a bit lighter (less). the state would lose money on criminal penalties, but it'd decrease the prison population (California is talking about releasing 40,000 prisoners early). also, less law enforcement money (like using Black Hawk helicopters to scan the sierra nevada for farms).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
ups / downs.. whatever. i am looking at it from a strictly financial standpoint. this state is fucked finanacially. we keep pouring more illegals into this state that is just pounding our infrastructure. 1/2 the emergency rooms in Los Angeles are shut down.. illegals come in and don't pay.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
it's just insane here right now. maybe some normlcy (get it) could alleviate the cash flow problem here (i.e, less cash flowing over the border).

      I have a framed collage in my living room made out of old Ninetendo Power magazines that I cut up solely for that purpose.

      Awesome, but the framing actually makes them lose a bit of their awesomeness. Not qualified for "to the max". I'd suggest keeping a ragged edge (well, not literally "ragged", but a non-even edge formed by the collaged panels) and maybe matting them on cardboard. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would, however, want something like that in my home. I suspect that (assuming I actually had money) I would not be alone in wanting to pay for something like that.

That's pretty awesome of you to say. I see what you're saying about the ragged edges, but we were working with a frame theme that's already running rampant in my living room, so it didn't even really cross my mind to stop it with that one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Along with the comic book one and the Nintendo Power one, I also have one of pinup girls. They are over the couch in my living room. It is like a thing. All in matching frames, you know? <br/>

Looking back on prohibition the thing that always strikes me the most is how people really only follow the law if it suits them. This disturbs me, but we see evidence of it all the time: speeding, piracy, drugs... people won't avoid doing something just because it's illegal. I don't think I'll ever understand this.

      Maybe because someone figured out that stealing, speeding, or plain getting out of control was somehow dangerous when highways, trees, or pissed off rightful owners were around, and imagined that making a law about it would make it easy on all? <br/> 
I mean, if you look at it backwards, you'll end up getting pissed at the govermint for intruding and controlling all aspects of an indiviudal's life.

      A law is to control/bring about the best for a collective not an individual. Unfortunately there are others who are not as well controlled as yourself (drug-induced psychosis is not fun [insert other reasons here]). I'll make it clear I don't yet have an opinion on the legalisation of pot.

      I met a little girl sitting in the middle of Ta Prohm temple with a civet on a leash. She let me take her photo and told me her family used the civet to process coffee in small batches. Given the excesive amount of Robusta available in Siem Reap and the seeming scarcity of decent Arabica, I'd say grinding cat poo and brewing a drink out of it is totally understandable. <br/>

Also, I have drunk it and civet coffee is amazingly smooth, if very expensive.

I had some that my brother brought back from Vietnam. Tastes really, really chocolatey. Very good. <br/>

He also brought me snake wine. With a dead cobra inside. <br/>

      You should mount that bottle of wine on the wall, with a back light and everything. Cobra eyes all staring at you no matter where you are in the room. <br/>

      The word barista (plural: baristi [masculine or mixed sex] or bariste [feminine]) is of Italian origin. In Italy, a barista is a "bartender," who typically works behind a counter, serving both hot (such as espresso) and cold alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. <br/>

      "I have no idea." <br/> 
"I think I swerved slightly into the other lane coming off the off-ramp." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have been pulled over only three times in my life and have never received a ticket. The first time I was coming down a hill and must have been a tad over the limit, but the officer was understanding. I still don't know how it happened as I was keeping an eye on the speedometer at the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The second time I can't recall what I said, but I accidentally cut off a cop while following a friend who drives very poorly. I didn't realize I would be cutting anyone off. I did not receive a ticket. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The third time I swerved a tiny bit into the oncoming lane on a two-lane back road with no lights at 3 AM because I wasn't familiar with the exit and there were no lights. I somehow sensed as this happened that the car I saw behind me was a police car, but I wasn't pulled over until I reached the main road. Obviously he probably thought I might have been drinking, but I clearly was not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Clearly the best solution is to carefully follow all traffic laws at all times and be honest and polite if you do happen to be pulled over.

      Really, aside from the type of fans he primarily attracts, there's nothing bad or stupid about Dane Cook's comedy. His style is way more original than, say, Demetri Martin. Just because 50% of his fans are frat types doesn't mean every hipster on the planet has to make him their punching bag.

      I agree, the sketches on his show are not all that funny.  There have definitely been times when I sit there thinking "man stop doing this to yourself".  But I think when he sticks to straight stand-up (as he does for about 5 minutes total each episode, sadly) he is terrifically witty.  It's nothing Steven Wright didn't already do, but it's still good stuff, and Demetri's delivery gets me every time.  But don't judge the man on his show.  It needs some work.

      I'm not judging him on his show. I've seen plenty of his standup, which is very funny, but not nearly as original as people seem to think it is. I did watch the premiere and thought the sketches were pretty terrible, and even the standup was subpar. Hopefully it'll get better, if it doesn't get canceled first.

Incidentally, a few months ago they came out with a new album of new material he was hoping to make into a CD before his death. It's not nearly as good as his completed stuff, but it's still Mitch. I seem to have been the only fan I know who's heard about it.

Bill Hicks on the other hand is a mixed bag. On one hand, he is very good, on the other hand he inspired some really horrible screechy comedy. DAVID CROSS I'M LOOKING AT YOU.

      Mitch Hedberg is OK, but just ridiculously kitschy.  Same with Demetri Martin, but more so (at least Mitch's schtick was somewhat original, if ultimately tiresome). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, I saw Martin's stand up special on Comedy Central a year or two back; again, funny at times, but ultimately he relies too much on his indie hipness/cuteness to carry his act, instead of actual talent. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To be honest, I've never given a shit about most stand up comedy.  Including Bill Hicks.

      I was confused by your taste in comedy for a second, gh, but your last sentence explained a lot. I mean, I don't agree with you at all, but I at least know why you'd say such things. Unfortunately, all the best stand-up comedians bash religion. It's basically mandatory.

      I think they should bash religion, and everything else they find illogical.  They shouldn't call Christians stupid though, because that isn't true.  What I'm saying is is that they should have proof that what they are accusing of being illogical actually is, or else they are as bad as Mencia.

      Yeah David Cross' schtick is basically HEY CHRISTIANS OR ANY RELIGIOUS PPL THEY SHURE ARE DUMB HURPA HURPA HURP OH AND AMERICA IS SHITTY AND EVERYTHING IS SHITTY BLAH BLAH. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't mind religion bashing, I know it is a thing and I'm a strong enough person that I can take it, but I think when your entire act is just bashing people you aren't a very good comedian. If David Cross wasn't so well loved by hipsters for Mr. Show and Arrested Development, or if he played better in the flyover states, he'd be bashed as much as Mencia.

      Opinion SHARED.  Rocky and Bullwinkle contains more jokes per minute than most entire DVD collections of popular sitcoms today, and that's not JUST because it was super hilarious but because for some reason that show played like a speed freak getting a shot of adrenaline as he got struck by lightning.  Rapidfire puns coming atcha like a Blitzkrieg, Cold War satire devastating whole towns like a hydrogen bomb, and of course Fractured Fairy Tales which is just the apex of "new spin on an old favorite," done 20000x better than Shrek. <br/>

      Well the first one was alright, in terms of "Here I am, a child for the most part, watching a well-animated movie with a good old fashioned fairy tale story  <em>with a saucy modern twist!</em> "   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the second was just pop cultural reference after reference.  It was basically the idea that "kids' movies can have something for the parents too" idea that's been hanging around since Pixar's been doing its thang, but ratcheted up a million fold to the point of suffocating the original not-so-bad idea. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In contrast to Fractured Fairy Tales, it is indeed a man serving you fried shit.  In comparison to other kids' movies, it is a man serving you fried shit with a penny on top.

      I'd blame the suicides on their parents for keeping them away from people like me and showing them how they could have real, fulfilling lives away from the stifling of their home. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We showed them life and, knowing they would never be able to have it, they chose death. But that does not make me the one to blame. I wished only to encourage their lives. It was their parents who wished to see it wither and die. In the end they got what the had always wanted.

      Guess what, Assetbar, Kirsten Dunst made an appearance in my dreams last night.  I was running down an alley (not in panic, fear, etc, just running) much like the one in Spiderman where she kisses him upside down, and she was there and looked at me with that horrific Dunstian smile and took her shirt off and she had big ol' jumblies and I was like "Oh I guess Kirsten Dunst isn't so bad" and kept running. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I woke up and remembered she doesn't have big ol' jumblies so I still say FUCK that bitch.

      Millions of Facebook photo comments changed to read "This party wasn't really that much fun but I gathered a few of the not so ugly friends together and took this picture. Later two guys got into a fight over the lyrics to Sweet Home Alabama and a girl locked herself in the bathroom and wouldn't come out until we all promised to tell her how good her hair looked. Steve got trapped in a closet with a guy he went to community college with and they did coke while having the world's least interesting conversation. The host kept trying to freeze frame moments from the movie The Matrix that really resonated with him but he was too drunk and kept hitting the input button on the remote. It was raining that night and as we walked home Sarah started crying and couldn't tell us why. I fell asleep on the couch that night watching The Toxic Avenger on USA and spooning a pillow. One of my roomates came in while I was sleeping and covered me with my jacket"

      "Me and my roommates all went to this party with the intent to hit on skinny alt-chicks but when we arrived we remembered that we are massive nerds and all we had to talk about was the fact that we spent the last six hours finishing up our planned 'Deadwood' marathon. I started hitting on this girl that Pete had hit on the week before and hadn't made any headway with, but I didn't do much better. Ian went upstairs to Lissa's room to see if she wanted to do coke or pot and maybe provide him with head. I got on the dancefloor and started approaching the skinny white girls, some of which were not into black guys, others you could tell were only going to dance with a black guy because it was  <em>so scandalous</em>  and had no intention of going home with me and even if they did we would not be a couple in the morning. It kind of makes me feel like semi-attractive black guys who can dance are the new slutty girls: good for a bonk but not relationship material. Maybe if I dated black women more I wouldn't have this problem. At the end of the night, me and my roommates all struck out so we went back to the suite and watched gay porn on Ian's computer, and did some bong hits. Ian had the running commentary, explaining to us non-bisexuals that there is a lot of gay porn where the pitcher is allegedly straight because there is a fantasy about turning straight men, but that you can see they are clearly gay  <em>(you can tell by the pixels)</em> . Eventually I got tired, went back to my room, jerked it to some (straight) hentai, and went to bed. Not Gay."

      I can't buy the historical inaccuracy of being able to pause a Matrix DVD (no earlier than 2000) and the USA Network showing something like The Toxic Avenger (highly unlikely to be shown anytime after USA Up All Night went by the wayside in the 98) on the same night.

      Good call. I think we can all also agree that Up All Night was significantly better when it was being hosted by Gilbert Gotfried and not that annoying girl who did the squeaky thing when she pronounced the title. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We desperately need to bring that back, but on another channel that's not going to be a prude about the very necessary gratuitous nudity. I'd say we need a whole channel for it, but that would ruin it. Gotta be late-night only. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In a way it might be a bit worse in the era of Tivo. I mean, you can't Tivo something like that and have be nearly as good. Plus the Tivo would probably be busy recording something else so you can't just flip over to it.

      It was a mashing together of things that have happened to me and stuff I just made up, hence the inaccuracy. I have been at a party where two men got into a fist fight over a song's lyrics but the artist was Tool not Lynyrd Skynyrd. I have been trapped in a closet doing coke with people but my name isn't Steve and I never went to community college. I have watched The Toxic Avenger on USA but it was indeed before The Matrix was in theaters much less on DVD.

Not surprising about Hank. He and GG had a lot in common. They both beat the fuck out of women and died by the needle. Both rammed bananas up their asses and exposed themselves to kids. The only difference was that GG explicitly detailed his trespasses. Hank kept it quiet. Hank took showers.

In fact, this goes for everyone who is in the vacinity of a jumpsuit that they may buy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not because I expect it to be in the least bit erotic, just because I expect it to be fucking  <em>hi-larious</em> .  I wouldn't argue with both, though.

      I am tickled by the idea of blowing your head off in a creek to avoid a mess.  Even better if you can do it just upstream from a funeral home.

      Not entirely funny. I was talking about this with a friend the other day when he admitted that he'd been sexually abused as a child and had a lot of issues with this for a while. At one point he'd considered suicide, but one of the main reasons he didn't go through with it was because he didn't want to create a mess or be a burden on others. <br/>

      I'll admit that I basically fall in love with every female I meet, even on the Webternet. <br/>

Also, up until three years ago I was the biggest dork and all my friends were goth kids. Once I discovered hipsterism they all stopped being my friends...now I have no friends.

      True, and I don't think most of us would deny that, but considering it was only recently proposed for the exact same reason of helping the California economy it seems that if there was not a direct influence it is at least an interesting coincidence.

      I have favored legalizing pot ever since my jackass of a roommate spent every hour of every day going on about how fucking wonderful it was and he subscribed to these asinine magazines and was always looking at these websites called bud toker.com or some bullshit and he was always the guy at the party rambling on about "medicinal effects" and "puritans" and I always thought MY GOD. Maybe if they legalized it you would SHUT THE FUCK UP. <br/>

So I support the legalization of marijuana.

      My freshman year debate coach in high school once related a story from when he was a child that was part of our own admit it day. He and some friends took a turtle and took it to the top of the steps at a split-level house and repeatedly dropped it, upside-down, onto the pavement of the driveway until the shell cracked open and the turtle died. <br/>

      I was walking along with a friend once, and he caught a frog.  He started throwing it up in the air, again and again, letting it drop on the road.  Then he handed it to me so I could try it.  I threw that frog as hard as I could down on the pavement, to kill it quickly.  My friend was upset with me.  I was eleven.   <br/>

      That's just growing up and, like you said, boundary stuff, yo.  I think in each of these cases we felt instant remorse at causing pain and suffering to another creature or person, as opposed to continuing to do it for no other reason but for the hell of it and feeling no remorse or anything.  I'm no psychologist or anything, but serial killer documentaries have taught me enough to know that  <em>that's</em>  where we start getting into sociopathic territory. <br/>

That, and lighting shit on fire that you  <em>just shouldn't light on fire</em>  - read: buildings, forests, people, animals.  If you regularly light animals or people on fire, you've managed the elusive Psychopathic Twofer.

      once upon a time i hit a hummingbird with a rock as it was hanging out on a branch near my house...but i did not feel bad. i was more amazed that it didn't flit off when it saw the rock coming more than anything. when i got close to the bird it took off just fine. no harm. no foul. (*fowl?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
this other time my friend and i got this lizard in a jar and were going to make a pet out of it but i felt too bad for it to be in there so i set it free again...and another time one of my friends filled a bigger juice bottle with lots of grass hoppers which i then i filled up with hot water and soap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
those are the only memories i have of doing things like this. i never spent a lot of time outside other than during recess at school, during which i either swang or played soccer or 500. at home i was too busy  not doing homework and chatting on Prodigy and playing computer games like Test Drive III and Kings Quest VI and later on, 3D Dinosaur Adventure. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i'm cpnglxynchos. and this, was my childhood.

      Actually, I'm pretty sure that pot was made illegal because it's easier and cheaper to grow than tobacco.  I know that marijuana was used as a "filler" in hand-rolled cigarettes, so as to make the same amount of tobacco go further, and I can't help but think that smokers would, in general, blow their smoke in a much less aggressive manner than they do now.  It's like they're pissed at it or something.  "I just want your carcinogens!  Get the  <em>fuck</em>  out of my lungs!" <br/>
