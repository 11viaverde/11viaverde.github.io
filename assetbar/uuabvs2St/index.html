      I like that plan. <br/> <br/> <br/> ...... And why hasn't anyone mentioned me anywhere here yet? Had people forgotten I ever existed by this stage? I feel so unloved.  <br/>

So in the interests of keeping to tradition: "Yanks suck, American is not English, zumicroom is a prat, blah blah blah".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Honestly, I tire of the ways of old. And the only thing Chris Onstad consistently does a bad job of is taking the piss out of this kooky little island. Some part of me is convinced he does so deliberately so as to seem ironic.  <br/>

If anyone has any lames left in this day and age, you may continue with YOUR side of the tradition starting NOW.

      I wouldn't go that far. You may be right regarding elegance, but I would say that any language that uses an alphabetic system is inherently more efficient than a logographic or syllabic one.

      Not so sure I agree there my good fellow. Tonal languages seem to unleash a whole 'nother can of worms. Aside from, of course, having to use it to convey word use as opposed to non-tonal languages where it can be used expressively.

      But I do know all the letters I need to make them, as opposed to Chinese where I would need to learn the character before I could write it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I speak merely for clarification, not to say that particular argument sways my opinion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My personal take on the logographic languages is I would hate trying to draw all those pictures.  My hands are so clumsy and my handwriting is so poor that even though I print every letter, what I write is barely legible.  And that is with only 26 characters.  I shudder to think how hard my writing would be to decipher if there were hundreds of possibilities to filter out of my scrawlings.

      Actually, normally here you only use the first, third, and last character (ji-han-ki) when referring to vending machine.  Using all five (ji-dou-han-bai-ki) is sort of unnecessarily formal.  Japan!  And even if the characters look sort of complicated, they're actually all basic ideas that you learn very early on.

      It's especially funny if you speak Russian. It's a loanword from Greek (I think), but in Russian 'glotka' roughly means 'throat' or 'mouth' so the first thing you think of when you hear polyglot is someone with many mouths. The root word is probably the same.

      Not really. It's actually (well, money is the real reason) one of the bigger reasons I don't travel abroad and would not want to expatriate (not to mention being on the outside of common cultural signifiers... like hanging out with people who all went to a high school other than yours) is because I don't understand the language. I don't want to be a dick who expects people to understand English and I know I'd just make a damn fool of myself clumsily trying to use their language.

      I think it's more because it's not necessarily British English- we're talking Australia, Canada, SO many countries that spell it that way. Just, y'know, not Americans, who had a dude called Webster pretty much make up their rules as he went along so he could make American English different.

      No, boo to the English for being the ancestors of Chaucer and Shakespeare and the Anglo-Saxons and molesting their language! <br/> 
God, how many times will modern Brits claim that American evolution and adaptation of the original British settlers' language (which is something that happens in every culture, because - shocker - language is not a stagnant entity that never evolves) means they're speaking incorrectly and American English is inferior? The British may have invented the English language, but you've fucked around with your ancestors' lingo over the centuries just as much as we have. <br/>

      I'm guessing that in this context 'invented' means 'cobbled together from three other languages.' <br/> 
I guess that counts, you could claim to invent the cheeseburger when you put the meat patty between slices of bread and put a slice of cheese on it. That doesn't really excuse being a twat when your nephew tries putting grilled onions on it though.

      There is no such thing as "real" English. Your definition of "real" English seems to be that the British were the originators of the English language, and Americans used a secondary, bastardized version. But evolving a language over time does not make it less real. If anything, based on your belief in the superiority of the original, "real" English would be the oldest version of the English language, and then you get into how far back Olde English can actually be considered English and not its predecessor. Whether you define the "original" English as Shakespearean English or Chaucer's English or whatever, the point remains that modern British English would be just as "fake" as American English because it bears very little resemblance to the original English language of a few centuries ago. <br/> 
Basically, I'm trying to say the whole "us modern Brits speak real English, whereas Americans speak an incorrect version because they evolved it and have different slang" is total condescending bullshit. Go read some fucking Chaucer if you want some "real" English. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Incidentally, I sort of want to become a linguistics major.

      That would be highly appreciated by all of the Top Gear fans here, and there appear to be a lot of us.  I only rarely watch it.  I occasionally get offended by how much they're all hating on American cars until I realize I've never actually owned an American car in 15 years of driving, or even rented one, due to the fact that they mostly suck.  I borrowed one once but it broke in about 20 miles.

      I get annoyed when they continuously crap on American cars. But then I get over it because if the English decided to come over and criticize my souped up Chevy truck,(in my Imagination, an emergency session of parliament would vote to send Jeremy Clarkson, Simon Cowell and Alan Rickman to yell about carbons) then my truck would sit there being quick and reliable and they'd still be wrong. <br/>

I would also give them a tow when their Lucas infested Jag's dessicated spaghetti wiring caught fire. Never be a dick to a stranger even if they have a questionable British car.

      I vowed never to buy American after I learned that my buddy's Ford Taurus was sold to him with the engine not bolted to the frame.  Since then I have gone Toyota-VW-BMW-Subaru.  German cars are pretty great, but they need to import some Japanese to work on the electronics, and the exchange rate makes purchasing another BMW unlikely in the near future. <br/>

      Scoobies are great. I sneakily convinced my folks to get a Forester XT, which is basically a WRX STI masquerading as a lesbian softball chariot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think I'll probably ever buy another new car, American or not. I was at a Chevy dealership and a goatee'd salesman tried to sell me a new Malibu. The conversation went like this: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Me: So, is this rear wheel drive then? <br/> 
Salesman: No, front wheel only. <br/> 
Me: I see. Can I get it in a stick? <br/> 
Salesman: No, but we have this lovely manu-matic <br/> 
Me: Hm. Can I order it with a V-8? <br/> 
Salesman: No, but we have these nice new overhead cam 6 cylinders that are pretty quick, or you could get an efficient high-tech 4 cylinder. <br/> 
Me: Can I get it with a basic radio, crank windows and pushbutton locks? <br/> 
Salesman: No, you have to get everything in one of three option packages with 20 disc changer bewoofered XM radio, bluetooth wireless starbucks locator, ass warmer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, I left him a number and said if GM ever makes a car that is basically the exact opposite of the Malibu that they should call me because I would like to get one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Germans don't fare much better. Trying to use either Bimmer's iDrive or Daimler's Komand is like making out with Helen Keller.

      To be fair, you don't have to get the iDrive with any BMW and I've never met anyone who went out of their way to order it. <br/>

Sounds like your needs in cars are pretty similar to mine.  I met a Dodge salesman at a social occasion.  He tried to get me to consider their crappy products.  I told him that no man should ever have to drive a slushbox under any circumstances, and nobody should ever have to drive FWD either.  I won't drive a truck or minivan either.  So I told him I would test drive anything he had that fit that bill. <br/>

He didn't have a Viper on the lot unfortunately.

I drive a Toyota Corolla with over 200,000 miles on it, and it still gets 33-35 miles to the gallon and runs great.  Let me know how your Focus is doing when it reaches the 200k mile mark, oh wait, it won't, because most American cars are designed to just barely outlast their warranty before falling apart.

      You're talking the old school Detroit of the 50's and 60's with planned obsolescnce and yearly model changes.  The new Detroit has learned from the Japanese manufacturers.  And your Japanese car could have been assembled here with a similar mix of globally sourced parts.  I'm at 75K with my 2003 Focus, so we will see.

      Actually there's quite a few 1950s and 1960s chevies still running around on their original engines and transmissions. The late 70s through the late 80s is when the American car manufacturers really went to hell and lost any sort of customer loyalty. Caddy V-8-6-4, Olds diesel, early 700R4s, thin casting 305 and 350s, not to mention the completely forgettable front wheel drive V-6s whose unfortunate platform GM still lives with today. People drive cars from that era with a grimace of angry determination. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, your Focus is a European ford design that is assembled in Mexico. It might actually be reliable. See, rather than design a platform, Ford these days pretty much just cribs Ford Euro or Mazda and changes the front end to look like a Mach 3 razor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But don't feel too bad. You coulda bought a Saab 9-2x in which case you would have bought a rebadged WRX wagon with a 10k Snaab markup. Or you could have got a Fusion which is a Mazda 6 with the Mach 3 razor treatment.

      Not just because of mine. I hear stories, man. I know people.  And what thorfinn says is correct. American cars are, by and large, not made to last. Once you start getting close to 100,000 miles on an American car, you'd better start planning when and how you're going to buy another, because it's not lasting much longer.

      It's still all hella anecdotal, and sometimes we hear what we want to hear.  Went to "Car Talk" to get some anecdotes of my own, and found a 2000 Focus (the first model year, I believe) with 140,000 miles, and for the 2001 model, 190K, 200K and 290K.  There were complaints, too.  Time will tell.  My 2003 is at 75,000 with nary a rattle or rust spot.

      not sure if what riazm mentioned is a law, but I do know that within the ancient city walls of York, it is legal to kill a Scotsman if he is wielding a bow and arrow.  Also, it is illegal to die in the Houses of Parliament.  In Liverpool, it is illegal for a woman to be topless, unless she is working as a clerk in a tropical fish store.

      Well, it's prounced differently. "Minge" rhymes with fringe, "minger" and "minging" are like singer/singing. And, minger and minging basically mean the same thing.

      A minger is a person who mings, or is minging if you prefer the gerund form. Possibly derives from the same root as the "minge" noun, but by using it in a modern society one would not risk implying relation to a vagina.

      I remember the first time that I was in England I was in a really crappy little pub and my first impression didn't go so well. I guess it was pretty downscale, because the place in question was filled with forty to fifty year old men with the shape and complexion of fairly lumpy potatoes who were clad in jumpsuits and wore enough jewelry to be spotted from the stratosphere, even if they were indoors. (Seriously, that much jewelry.) While I heard that Americans were frequently loud, brash, and obnoxious in usually quiet pubs, these gentleman shouted at one another with a vernacular that I can only guess originated in the fourth century, probably in a town whose industry was dominated by pigs.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The highlight of the hour came when one waitress had to bend over to pick something up, which is when one gentleman stood up behind her and mimed buttfucking her, much to the delight of all.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was sort of disappointed with the revelation that most of England was populated with convicted rapists, but I was soon proven otherwise, because several had been acquitted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Honestly, though, besides that strange introduction I had a great time and I often yearn to go back.)

I once heard a comedian describing Oklahoma: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>As the settlers were traveling west, the quality of the land kept getting worse and worse.  It never occurred to them that eventually it would begin to get better.  So by the time they got to Oklahoma, they said, "Damn, we had better stop here, because if it gets any worse we won't be able to live!"<br/>
<br/>
So Oklahomans are descendants of people who settled there because it was as bad as they could stand it.  And they spend their lives thinking, "When do we die?"</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
(And yes, I am aware that there is no historical accuracy to this tale whatsoever.  Nonetheless it offers an apt description of the lives of many of the state's inhabitants.)

      This is an intriguing idea. Maybe I should inspect the yahoo group first, but have there been any thoughts as to where this would be held? Based on the cities I've heard mentioned, it would seem that the most centralized location would be somewhere in Southeastern Oklahoma. That raises the question of whether or not we should try to find a centralish point which is also a decent place, itself (unlike Southeastern Oklahoma).

      Bull bars are frowned upon in the UK because we have relatively few wild animals likely to put a dent in our bonnets (or "hoods"), so they're more commonly associated with mowing down schoolchildren. <br/>

      I am actually replying to spinynorman, but this gets my comment closer to his then replying to it directly would. <br/> 
Shotguns do not have calibers, they have gauges.  The gauge is the number of equal weight shells can be made from one pound of lead, so a smaller number means a bigger gun.  With a 12-gauge, for example, a pound of lead is divided into 12 equal parts, and each of those parts is made into several small pellets or one solid slug.  The pellets or slug are then turned into a shotgun shell.  I'm not sure if they use the same weight measurements for steel shot, but it's a similar system.

      I think this is more than just a fluke. You, see, the rest of the world has this stereotype about American tourists being loud, obnoxious, gaudy, drunk, and unwilling to engage the local culture. But after my trip to Europe this summer, I came back firmly convinced that this must be the result of people having mistaken British tourists for Americans on numerous occasions, because in all of the above categories, the Brits did not simply take the cake, but ran with it drunkenly for several blocks before vomiting upon it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm sure heccibiggs and scotico will come along to kick me in the bollocks, but hear me out, I have a theory for why this is the case. You see, as Americans, we know what the world thinks of us. So when we go abroad, we want desperately to prove them wrong and therefore tiptoe around like scared little children, making sure to say 'merci beacoup' while trying way too hard to mimic the local pronunciations. The kind of Americans that don't care what the world thinks of them are perfectly content to take their vacations in Disneyland or Vegas. On the other hand, to a Brit, Nice or Mallorca is the equivalent of these destinations. Perhaps they believe that simply by virtue of British blood in their genes they are automatically more cultured and European than Americans and can do no wrong. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Exhibit A: Coming back from the bars one night, we went to get a kebab. The guy in front of us lazily tried to pronounce "kebab et frites," then gave up and defiantly slurred in a "fuck this" kind of tone - "Oi, mate, lemme get a kebab and chips!" - repeatedly shouting it several times at the befuddled guy at the counter. <br/>

Ted: You see, that's one of the great things about getting involved with someone from another country. You can't take it personally. What's really terrific is that when we act in ways which might objectively seem asshole-ish or, or, incredibly annoying, they don't get upset at all. They don't take it personally. They just assume it's some national characteristic. <br/>

      My observation last summer in Germany agrees with you largely but not entirely.  Being aware of the phenomenon of the "ugly American" I tried to act nice, be quiet and respectful, speak the language, etc. <br/>

It is true that we are a loud people.  Even the people I was traveling with who were consciously trying to behave themselves still spent the entire trip shouting.  Apparently there's something in our water that makes us all shout at all times for no reason.   <br/>

I suspect that the reputation of Americans as bad tourists will fade since, due to the current administration, only the wealthy or fiscally irresponsible can travel anywhere.

      In general, my feeling would be that the further you get from a country, the better the people from that country become. I agree with most of the points you have raised - virtually without exception the Americans that I have met outside of the US have been courteous, kind and intelligent people. Similarly, as a Brit, I can pretty much confirm that spinynorman's first impressions of British people in Britain is par for the course. Travelling around Europe, as well, I frequently had to avoid people with the same accent as me. Brits in Europe suck and it cannot be denied. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But then, Europe is Britain's back yard, so the proper comparison would be with the Americans in Cancun. I live in Greece and work in the Middle East, now, and, hey - all of the sudden, the Brits are courteous, kind and intelligent. You've just got to get away from the teenagers running distraction in Prague's strip clubs.

And, it depends who you met, really. Thing is with Britain, we have this massive drinking culture. They're really trying to crack down on binge drinking at the moment, because there are so many stupid boys and idiot girls who just get really drunk and go crazy, and if you visit somewhere like Mallorca, there's going to be tons of young people going on holiday and just going completely batshit insane. I haven't taken a holiday like that, but my brother has, and he didn't totally lose it, but he saw people who did - like a group of young guys who were so blind drunk at ten in the morning that they couldn't find their way back to their hotel, and they were going to miss their flight because of it. <br/>

Mr. Gordon Ramsay: "Billy, you twat!  You call this a fucking <yeast colony>.  My 97 year old grandmother can plate a better <yeast colony> and she's got fucking arthritis.  Did you hear me?  I said her hands are arseholed.  I'd be a generous man to give you an F."

      I often feel that Achewood reaches out to a really strange cross section of a very tiny demographic. I mean, almost no one else I know knows shit about Top Gear, a show I watch very regularly (how fucking awesome is the Atom and Jeremy's motor "boat"?), but here the first page of responses are all Top Gear-oriented. Everything fits. <br/>

      i'm still confused, i don't want to study, and i feel like fulfilling a few more stereotypes besides those: <br/> 
 <br/> 
were you being retarded because you sincerely did not get his joke or was it because you made an unfunny by intentionally saying something obvious for humorous effect, and that joke is where the supposed irony lies that i was supposed to have missed?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
if it is the first, then i don't see the paradox or giant loop of irony (dramatic irony in that i did not understand your verbal irony and thereby confirmed the statement you made in missing bjorntd's own irony).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
but if it is the second, then why are you telling me 'no' and that i confirmed your statement by not recognizing you being retarded (as opposed to being ironic)? or does 'retarded' mean 'failed ironic humor', as we are dealing with the second case (but that should make your answer be 'yes'...unless you are being verbally ironic...or are still being retarded...which would be dramatic irony...oh god, where have i wandered in my ignorance)?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
this is why america needs 'arguments and discussions'.

      In Munich, the greens are much greener.  It's possible that it just seemed this way since I flew there directly from So. Cal., and everything at home was on fire for about 6 months last year, but it sure seemed that the standard green was deeper than ours, and the local palette of landscape, building, clothing, etc. used a lot more brown.

      The colour in Britain drains out the further north you go. London is in full Technicolor. Head north to the Midlands and you'll notice everything is sepia-toned, like a Box Brownie photo from the 70s. Continue up the M1 and when you pass the sign saying "Welcome to THE NORTH" everything goes black-and-white and the tune from the Hovis advert starts to play.

      This is very true. The preferred palettes, from what I've seen, are Pastel and Extreme Neutral (black, white, navy, grey, and washed out browns... carefully arranged so that none of these are juxtaposed in such a way as to generate an interesting contrast.) Primary  Colors smack of outright rebellion.

      The biggest shock to me when I spent a little time in England was how okay they are with ugly celebrities, and "television presenters".  I saw like, four pregnant girls introducing old episodes of Quantum Leap, old frizzy-haired ladies promoting a call-in scam show, and chubby little men in the corner of the screen doing sign language.  Not a looker in the bunch.  It was a great place to visit, but if you're looking to watch attractive people on television it's not the best vacation spot.

      Very true, I suppose I should've qualified: ugly celebrities who are not men, and are not used only as one-trick laugh ponies.  For instance, we have Kathy Bates.  She's an unfortunate looking woman, according to scientific standards.  Here in the US, she is a fat joke and a murderer.  In England, she might actually be the bumper between episodes of Magnum PI.

      One thing I remember quite vividly about my trip to London (about six or seven years ago) was something I saw on telly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was some sort of music programme. I don't recall its name. But at one point, a band played, fronted by an odd-looking fat man with a shaved head and sunglasses (indoors). He was holding a steering wheel and "singing" a terrible song about how he "done got me a new motor." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The climax of the performance came as the man dropped to the floor and began to roll around in circles, crazily turning the steering wheel, screaming about his new motor. <br/>

      I would've thought Stephen Fry's long list of credentials makes him the opposite of an A-list celebrity. In today's world of labial exposure.

      Over the summer I went to camp with a very dim-witted British girl who was very surprised when I said that I knew the Speaker of the House's name. She replied, "How do you know these things? It took me a month to figure out who was running the country, Gordon Brown or Gordon Ramsay!" <br/>

      As a Scottish person living in England, whose employer (the BBC) engages all but one of the subjects, I come over all patriotic and proud of our %u2018flinty%u2019 celebrities like Stephen Fry. I saw him once, and we said %u2018good morning%u2019 to one another %u2013 such is the reserved British way.  <br/> 
There is indeed something strangely exciting and glamorous about your American stars %u2013 I saw Coolio in Waitrose supermarket in Marylebone once and, no kidding, I was like %u2018SQUAAAWK!%u2019 <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I have to call bullshit on the bad teeth thing. We get state-funded orthodontics for children, so any Brits with wonky teeth were probably brats who refused to get braces, whereas Americans with poor teeth are, I guess, poor. And if we're genetically pre-disposed to it, then you likely are too.

      I went to five different primary schools in various areas of Scotland, and every one of them called their physical education classes 'gym'. I only went to one high school, though, which called it 'PE'. <br/>

Scottish and English education systems are however very different.

      I can confirm that there is gym class in Scotland. One wears 'gym shoes' to do it. It is indeed called 'PE' in high school, in the same way that 'play time' becomes 'interval'. If you say 'play time' at high school you get your head kicked.

      I realize that these definitions are no longer used, but they can often stir up nerdy English major adversarial discussions. <br/>

to sup - to eat meal with cold meat <br/> 
 <br/> 
supper - a meal with cold meat, time of consumption irrelevant <br/> 
 <br/> 
to dine - to eat a meal with hot meat <br/> 
 <br/> 
dinner - a meal with hot meat, time of consumption irrelevant <br/> 
 <br/> 
Given these origins to these words, which is chosen to designate the last meal of the day is colloquial.  In other words, you are probably going to call it what your mom called it. <br/>

Insisting one is better than the other is kind of silly.

      There's a fair amount of rubbish that needs to be said here. I walked past James May last week - I did not go "COO COO CLUCK CLUCK SIGN ME BOOK PLEASE" I just gave a smirk while people tried stood in the background and tried to ruin the shot for whatever documentary he was making. It was part of a crazy British celebs week I had in which I stood next to Frank Skinner and Reggie Yates from CBBC at gigs. I know, I know, boring celeb stories - but it gets better because I now know someone whose fucking Jeff Goldblum and am friends with the new face of the Nintendo Wii. Meanwhile I am insignificant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Everything is wrong with Billie Piper's face and that is what makes it so so right.  How can any human being not love that face. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also shudder to think what Mr. Clarkson's history classes would be like. <br/>

      No, Keira Knightly, Kate Beckinsale, Orlando Bloom, Cate Blanchett and Clive Owen are A-list Brit Celebs. Those are TELEVISION people; like John Tesh or Doctor Phil or Judge Judy.
