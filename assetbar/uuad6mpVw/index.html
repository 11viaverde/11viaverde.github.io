      One time I was at a party a girl I know was loaded and taunting me to play shot-for-shot with her.  Her boyfriend, a friend of mine, was insisting, by threat of retaliation, that I not punch her.  I laughed it off at the time as my friend being over-protective.  At that point in my life I had yet to have a girlfriend and didn't put myself in his shoes; as in not wanting to have a guy punch your girlfriend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When he went to the washroom, she ran up to me and was like "Do it now!  <strong>Hard!</strong> "  So I wound up and threw one at her shoulder, completely missed and nailed her side-long on her tit.  My friend came back and, seeing his girlfriend crumpled on the ground, clutching her chest, punched me square in the face.  I deserved it.

      Correct. No matter how many sheets to the wind you (both) may be, it is never acceptable for a man to strike a woman.  <br/>

      Well...I was trying to look after my girlfriend, who was having a panic attack, and then boob-girl came in and tried to pull me back out into the party, and I explained what I was doing, and she looked in, saw my girlfriend crying, and said "she'll be fine on her own". I jokingly boob-punched her. I can still hear the screams. You make the call. <br/>

      Also, they're eyes! In my mind, I have a slightly idealized vision of foeti (awesome term, by the way). In my mind, they look sort of like alien greys: big black eyes, tiny little grasping, vestigial hands, nasty feeding rope, and a little twitching mouth, mouthing the black words of ancient, dead gods. I think it might have something to do with the fact that I have pretty severe night terrors, and the few images I can recall are of foeti or things with elements of foeti.
