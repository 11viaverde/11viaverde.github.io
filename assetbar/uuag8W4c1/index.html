      even gay men don't think the miata is a hot rod <br/>

I'm being serious, no car is as fun to drive as a tiny roadster, and the miata happens to be much more reliable than anything else in that category.

The weather isn't all that bad in Britain, why I drove to work with the top down today (although I did put it back up in case it rains). And I do have a hardtop for the winter. <br/>

In fact, I read that more convertibles are sold here than in Continental Europe because it's too hot for them there, people drive around with the top up and the a/c on. <br/>

      <strong>Vlad's Wedding Garb, Explained</strong> <br/> 
 <em>The Hmegoldt, the traditional formal male costume of Volgidania, dates to the mid-1100s. It is customary at any function where you or I might wear a full suit or tuxedo, and it is also the uniform of the Volgidanian army (although the "singing" blackbird mounted on the civilian headdress is exchanged, in this use, for a more menacing closed-beak bird). </em> <br/>

      It doesn't have to be old people.  I just gave the example of my parents (earlier than this, but now below) because that was sufficient to rule out the 17th century Welsh religious types.  My siblings and their spouses call each other "Mom" and "Dad" around the kids.  It's convenience and clarity in operation.

      My parents call refer to each other as "mom" or "dad" around my siblings and I sometimes too, but it seems odd with Molly's parents referring to each other as "mother" and "father" when they're talking to each other and their kids aren't even there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess it's not as strange as I initially reacted.  The first thought that popped into my head when I read it was of cartoons where the main character's parents don't have names and just go by "_____'s mom/dad," which made it seem sillier than it actually is.

      It must be a thing of younger generations that you do not understand this.  My parents called each other "Mom" and "Dad" (or "Mommy" and "Daddy" when I was very little) because that's who they were to us kids.  There were nine of us, and my mom always ran through all of the names to get to mine. <br/>

      I don't know, of all the words I'm familiar with, I'd figure 'Mother' and 'Father' to be the most static among English speakers.  Mother meaning a female who has birthed something, father meaning a male who has sired something.  Which, would make it an acceptable term of endearment when referring to the mother or father of your child. <br/>

I could easily be wrong though, I'm no language usage expert.   <br/>

      Yeah the doctors don't tell you that you have a 3 day nosebleed. THREE DAYS. Then you throw up blood. I didn't know it was safe to lose this much blood. I feel like I have ebola, minus the dying thing. And I haven't even ruled out the death yet. <br/>

      Uh, I've had sinus surgery a couple of times, as well as two tonsillectomies and additional procedures where the tonsils used to be.  I never threw up blood, let alone having a three-day nose-bleed.  On the other hand, a co-worker of mine had some rare bleeding disorder that was only discovered after her sinus surgery, as it led to multi-day nose-bleeds.  Have you been back to the doctor?

      Well, I had two polyps removed and a deviated septum fixed, so basically the drainage of blood from the nose to the stomache is what caused it all. I talked to my doctor though, and he basically said that it should stop today.

      Just for future reference: polyps don't need to be removed by surgery (and considering they often come back, it's often not the best option). I had an ENT surgeon say I had no other alternative after a CatScan showed pretty heavy blockage and polypy goodness. It's clear now. The answer was acupuncture, herbal tablets that the acupuncturist sorted and sinus flushing (with salt water). Saved A STACK of money in the end. And wasn't carved up like a ham. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said having your deviated septum undeviated must be rad. Nose breathing made easy.

      In all seriousness though, do you happen to have any idea what those supplements are? My main problem was the septum, but I'm a singer, and recurring polyps can be a pretty serious thing. This was my first surgery for this crap -- and I'd prefer it be my last.  <br/>

      I'm pretty grossed out by that panel for some reason.  It just looks wrong, she has no mouth, she has massive collarbones, and just a lot more detail to the body than usual.  It's well done and all, but in my head she's a squat little cat girl, not an elegant feline lady. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess I'm just surprised to see her grow up.  <em>*sniffle*</em>  I always cryticize at weddings. <br/>

is it that she's sucking in to fit in the dress, and somehow that makes her mouth leave her face?

      I half made that post to make fun of feminist literature, but the other half I meant in the sence that Achewood isn't exactly a mainstream comic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I, for one, wouldn't have ever started reading it if I hadn't spent a summer in california and had some high person show it to me at a party. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was hanging out with smoking college kids -- the people most likely to surf the internet for things which could lead them somehow to Achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Feminists aren't exactly what I would consider the leading demographic here -- nor are british people. Nor are old people actually. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So how the hell are people finding Achewood?  <br/> 
I'm lookin at you pogo, loneal, and you several British people out there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And for that matter, catgrl, you are the only person your age (that I know of) on AssetBar.  <br/>

      I found it by being an Internet geek, mainly. I have a bookmark list of literally about 50 webcomics that I read every day. If you're reading Dinosaur Comics or whatever, you're eventually going to run into Achewood, as it's not exactly obscure within the webcomics community.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I attend Onstad's alma mater, and Achewood is printed in the campus humor magazine, so we have a higher-than-average exposure to Achewood on my campus.

      Jesus Christ, how the hell did you know that? Turns out all you need to do is do a lot more f-f-fuckin'! <br/> 
 <br/> 
But for real now: I have the feeling I told this sory here before, but since I can't be arsed to check, I'll just tell it again. Once apon a time, when I was a wee lass of but eleven, I was searching the internet for some comics. A lot of them were pretty sucky and the main characters were all (mostly) dudes, so I had the brilliant idea to search "girl comic". "Hmm, Cat and Girl, that doesn't sound bad. *Click*" I was greeted by a large anthropomorphic cat and an interesting, funny comic. Now, upon reading the bit where they time-travel to the nineties, I decided to look up "90's" on Google Images, and what did I see but xkcd's 90's flowchart! Oh boy! Anyhoo, I was reading through the archives of that until I came across the Achewood parody strip. "Heh" said I, "That's pretty funny. I wonder if the actual comic is lik- *PTHCHOW* (The sound of a mind being blown)" <br/> 
 <br/>

      I found this comic because I read Dinosaur Comics as one inclined to appreciate creative linguistics. Eventually, I noticed North's links at the bottom, and that ended up branching off to Achewood. In my experience, few people get linked to Achewood just because their stoner friends read it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Actually. Side-rant. You know, there isn't any particular leading demographic here. Many stoners read this comic, but so do a ton of young intellectuals who don't touch the stuff. Doctoral students read Achewood, as do the middle aged, as do the high school crowd. If anything, Achewood's target demographic is just the flat out "quirky" demographic. We are mostly people who have either been through (or know people afflicted with) depression. Mostly introverts. Those are a few of the scarce traits that actually bring us all together. Certainly not our choice of herbal intoxication. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nevertheless. What's the big deal? Are you unable to entertain the notion that, indeed, humor is not based on demographics or ideology? I know, I know. Treasonous talk. Perish the thought. All that jazz. But you're expressing some seriously odd biases in these posts. I'm curious as to where you're coming from, because I honestly don't get it.

      Old was meant to be over 55. Old as in, "Hey, check out that old codger! Isn't he a hoot!" not old as in "When is this old guy going to die?" <br/> <br/> <br/> Cause I get the impression that 99% of the world's population has never talked on an internet webcomic forum about strange, strange things with people older than their parents. <br/> <br/> <br/> As for the expected age: for some reason I always figured webcomics were read from the 15-35 age range. <br/> 
I have no idea why and I have absolutely no way to back up why I thought that.

      Well, I'm fairly certain the average participant in internet humor forums is a male between the ages of 15 and 35.  18 to 35 year old males are one of the larger markets for anything, really.  The only corroborating evidence you need there is to go ahead and hover over all the avatars. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are some outliers, sure, but the strip most highly rated is "Ray Gets Sort of Stoned" and I'm seeing an awful lot of young dudes here, with a few notable exceptions in regards to age and sex.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I don't think your assumption was that crazy.  Any broad stroke is going to have some detractors, but to say that Assetbar, like the rest of participant-based internet humor areas, doesn't mostly attract disaffected young men would be silly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Remember the shock on Handface Afternoon because there were a few older people and ladies?

      Is it bad I forget how I found Achewood? I used to read Penny Arcade alot, which if I remember correctly doesn't reference Achewood at all! <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the idea of reading Dinosaur Comics and then finding Achewood is funny, since it was the reverse for me. I kinda decided I like Dinosaur Comics better than Achewood now. I dunno, I've never NOT laughed at a Dinosaur Comic but plenty of Achewood's have left me dry.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, I would rather read Achewood than 99% of the webcomics out there. I love Achewood.

      Yeah, Penny Arcade doesn't reference achewood because it is terrible. And for that matter, Dinosaur Comics are a lazy comic that repeat the same formula. And I don't just mean the art; the writing is just pretentious wikipedia entry after pretentious wikipedia entry. It's okay, but...well, you suck, good sir.

      I can't remember how I stumbled across Achewood, but it was years ago, before the commenting thing began.  My younger brother might remember, because I told him about it right away and he's still at the same job with the same email.  It must have been some article or something on the web about the strip, because it it the first on-line cartoon I ever saw.  Those early Achewood days were strange and wonderful, not knowing if anyone but my bro even looked at the thing, laughing uncontrollably.  Then I took a long break due to circumstances, and when I came back, all you idiots were here!  So I commented my way up through the archives, and was lucky enough to be around on handface weekend.

      I agree with daidai. Feminists are idiots. Also, they're really a disturbingly homogenous bunch. Very few differences between the lot of them. Why can't they see a perfectly good situation for what it is and stop being sluts? And what, do you still expect chivalry? Fuck. Oh, and one more thing: you claim to be against sexism, but we never see any MEN'S help centers, do we. <br/>

That is maybe my favorite anti-feminist argument ever. "If it was really against sexism, it would be called humanism." <br/>

      Here's a good one: I support post-natal abortion. Although that has little to do with actual foeti, so perhaps "Bitch, if you get pregnant I am going to punch the foetus out of you". Not really a joke, just something my friend's boyfriend said to her.

      Uh well dang man I guess I would not call it "old-fashioned" to think that so much as totally ignorant, but I know you're (kinda) joking. I um guess I like Achewood because of the way it plays around with language, and because I identify strongly with Roast Beef's neuroses and depression, and because Philippe is really hilariously cute, and because it is the most intelligent and literary comic in existence, and because it makes me laugh and stuff? I've said before that I'd like more female characters and/or a more three-dimensional Molly (which this arc is happily starting to provide), but I submit that it is actually pretty easy for feminists to read Achewood because it very rarely relies on the tired gender humor you see in so many webcomics (or pretty much any other medium, including Assetbar). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I mean, it is sweet that you read The Awakening and all, but feminism and feminist-friendly literature have evolved a little since that was written. I don't seem to remember any drowning in The Handmaid's Tale or any abandoned children in Stone Butch Blues. Has Allison Bechdel been putting out some stuff I haven't heard about? I would feel incredibly betrayed if Elizabeth Tallent has changed her subject matter without letting me know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And hey, that Virginia Woolf shit was important when it was getting written, even if it seems a little passe now. To completely dismiss wanting to be free of marital bonds and ties to children that society pressured you into having really ignores the shit women had to go through in the past. If the only option society gave you was getting married and having kids, any modicum of sexual or economic independence seemed out of reach, and it was actually pretty reasonable to wish you could escape that all and have a career and affairs the way men could. As a white dude in the 21st century you've got about a million times more social privilege than even the rich white ladies back then, so it might be kind of hard to imagine for you, but I am confident you can do it if you try really hard. Maybe use some of them painkillers and hallucinate it or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In conclusion, you can go on assuming whatever you want about feminists and the ways they are entertained, I guess. Hard as it may be to believe, though, we have senses of humor just like real people!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sincerely, <br/> 
Loneal <br/>

PS I don't think you can use the word "neither" with three options. <br/> 
PPS Get better soon!

      That's why I'm here too! But I'm disappointed that there wasn't a strip about the bridal shower--maybe an all-girls trip to Vegas? And what about shopping for the wedding dress, and picking out items for the gift registry? Achewood should have more scenes to appeal to use ladies.  <br/> 
(I read Achewood every day, but never post. I'm just breaking out of lurker mode to be weakly sarcastic.)

      Hey. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Woops. Sorry I definitely didn't intend to be cruel at all with what I said, and looking back I totally understand that I was being a douche. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was half making a feminist joke and half wondering how it is that AssetBar has such a diverse core of people posting on it. It is that diversity that keeps me coming back to this website every day to see not only if a new strip is up, but also what everyone else has said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't mean to be an ignorant pigdog or anything, I was really just messing around and ended up looking like a total bitch fool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This was about the least intentional bit of ackassery I have ever been involved in, except maybe one time in middle school when I said a 'your mom' joke to a kid whose mom actually had died like a week before (...I felt so bad I bought and wrote a card. With my own money.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
I never meant to get on any nerves or anything, but I entirely see how I did so. My bad, I am drugged up, angry, and generally say stupid things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hope I don't seem like an asspie anymore. <br/>

      I was introduced to Acheweed by a former acquaintance of mine who sent me an Internet Link to one of the "Saddest thing in the world" strips.  I clicked around a bit, saw maybe ten strips, and closed it. <br/> 
Later that day I spent a frantic couple minutes searching for what I had seen earlier 'cause I didn't remember the name or anything, but I found it again.  Since then I've read it regularly.

      so basically, a person could put a web cam on assetbar... <br/> 
a little script that snaps a capture from the web cam, and uploads the image file... <br/> 
every time people refresh, they would get a fresh capture from your web cam.  all you have to do is make an [img] post referencing the image file in question on your server

      Taffy is indeed still dead, his paranormal powers allow him to succeed at video games.  He is also the one that caused the ship to sink, resulting in Molly's (and the entire family's) deaths.  He is not just a "Winter Son" in the literal sense, but a dark shade that has been given temporary leave to roam the Earth again. <br/>

Such a foul, demonic child is the only thing that could stem the prodigious flow of life from the loins of the Saunders.  This comic contains an extreme amount of foreshadowing, and dark things will come to those that associate with TAFFY.

      Don't do that. In other news, your grammar makes it look like that Emeril's pants are in the background while he is elsewhere.

      In Oxford, they don't even bother to make it a restaurant. You drunkenly stumble up to a damn  <em>van</em>  on the damn  <em>street</em>  or you get no kebab. That way, not only the cooks and kebab consumers but also a myriad of passersby get to hear you make a fool out of yourself because you are American and don't know what Ribena or a chip butty are. It also increases your public humiliation after some boys dare you to brave the high street in your underwear and you're really not drunk enough to justify it, but you do it anyway, and then the kebab guy asks you if you want sauce on your chips and you say no and he says, "I can see you're already saucy enough." <br/>

We have Kebab Vans in Melbourne too. The Greeks won't sell a Gyro or a Souvlaki from a van but the Lebanese are more than happy to sell Kebabs. My favorite Kebab Van is called "Mr Funny Kebab" although it used to be written in a weird font and looked like "Mr Furry Kebab".

      Fun story: When Ramses Luther Smuckles walks anywhere, the ground beneath his feet crunches.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Do you know why? <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's because he's not walking on the ground; the soles of his shoes are _embedded with teeth that he's had to kick out of people's faces._ <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's what makes that crunching noise.

      Yeah, that was one of the weirder aspects of the wedding arc to me.  I kept trying to figure out why Ray's father, who by all accounts pretty much abandoned him, would be lurking around his best friend's wedding. <br/>

Made for some good laughs, but it was still sort of odd to me.  I mean,  <em>I</em>  wouldn't even get that involved in my best friend's wedding.  A Cuisinart, those are expensive.

      I feel that it is probably because Beef is basically the co-champion of the GOF. He bucked the rules with Ray and succeeded, and for that Ramses has much respect.
