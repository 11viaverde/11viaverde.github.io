      I caught this strip last year and thought it'd be a good idea to "get all spry on Grolsch" on 4th of July.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't make it through one before I started pawning off the rest of the $8 4 pack on people.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is truly a horrible brew.

      Then be thannkful you've (probably) never tried Grolsh Kanon. It comes in a black 500ml can and is 11.6% alcohol. It tastes like carbonated malt syrup with ethanol. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just got ... something on Grolsch Kanon. 'Spry' isn't exactly the word. 'Dynamic', perhaps. <br/>

One can is enough for a pleasant buzz, two is pushing it.

      I'm gonna get this thing. I'm in a bit of a quandry, though. I have the first four but we got a new kitten who decided to critique "Man Why You" by peeing on the first three issues. Issue four was only saved because I had decided to reference Pat's skitter cart on some dude's blog. As such, it was out of range of the initial ammonia barrage.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, I want to remain frugal, but I want those books in readable condition. I think Chris is more deserving of my money than most folks selling t-shirts on the web these days, but I'd rather drop the funds on a GOF poster than replacement copies of some soiled zines. <br/>

      Agh! Need wedding action. Yeah, I know; it's going to take hell of a long time to get there but the reactions to the bombshell will be very cool. And don't worry, Philippe; it's okay, you just caused a school bus to crash into a Dairy Queen.

      I love the zine pages.  I mean, do I want to see the wedding plot advance?  Sure.  Do I want to see Lyle beat Téodor in a game of tetherball using only his spew?  Of course.  But the zine cover has good stuff. <br/> We have beef giving sass-mouth to Redbook, Oprah, and Jesus.  We find out that Philippe has made a terrible mistake... possibly because of a problem.  I love the confirmation that the Braebicus Dict is Beef's Christ complex taking literary form.  Maybe we'll get a new chapter where Mary expects Jesus to have an opinion on wedding reception centerpieces.

      I think this strip confirms that which we all feared: Onstad is reading these and taking note. We can see in the "editor's hello corner" that Beef points out that the 'zine isn't going to change at all now that the two are married. I'm pretty certain Onstad really means that the strip isn't going to change, in response to comments of concern earlier. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just like Lyle and the vomit, it looks like Onstad is responding to our comments here. I don't know if I'm right or if I'm not. But I figure the answer is probably. 'Stad, please do us a favour: stop reading what we post. It's influencing you.

      Onstad is being led by our comments and is sending us subtle messages about the achewood strip via the medium of Beef's 'zine... <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>or</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's perfectly in character that Beef would write this, and 'Stad (pbuh) isn't such a big sappy sap to be pushed around by comments by us insignificant specks of nothing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know which one I find more plausible.

      He's said before that what he reads in forums and the like influence him- and it's only logical that he moderates his own message board for the comic. Seems like the more logical conclusion to assume your first answer to me.
