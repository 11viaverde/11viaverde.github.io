      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009142745/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_on_Target">"The book starts with Joe Hardy screaming - "Get out of the way, Frank". He is running to the place where an explosion just took place. Their car had a bomb in it and it exploded.<br/>
<br/>
Joe Hardy's girlfriend - Iola Morton, was in the car when the explosion took place, killing her. Joe is unable to believe it. Frank &amp; Joe begin their investigation. They meet a person who calls himself 'Gray Man' from a government agency called 'The Network'. Frank and Joe take his help to get to the person who planted the bomb. Soon they learn that it is not a person - but a group of terrorists who call themselves 'Assassins'.<br/>
<br/>
Joe vows to kill them. As the story progresses, some Assassins are killed in encounters while others escape. They come to know that the person who killed Iola is a member of The Assassins named 'Al-Rousasa'."</a>

      Ah...that makes sense now.  I only ever heard one pair of kids say it, so I figured it was just an in-joke between them, but I didn't think of it being a quote. <br/>

sweet valley high: one of the twins gets alcohol poisoning, the other starts selling her body to pay for the medical bills. somewhere in there: at least one DUI and prison scene. <br/>

Tragically the hormonal changes brought on by puberty drive the beasts wild with hunger and he is swiftly dismembered and greedily devoured.  The last lines read "...the blood ran out over earth / and in and out of stones / and through the grass / and into the pile of his very own bones / where they had made a supper of him / and it was still hot"

The janitor was late to wayside elementary, very late. He had not woke until 10:00 am. When he arrived in his white panel truck he found a terrible scene. Wayside elementary had collapsed. <br/> 
"What was the city thinking putting only one classroom on every floor? What did they think would happen?" A policeman commented. <br/> 
The janitor watched as rescue teams moved in, but he knew what they would find, not a single body, only rats. Dead, decaying rats.

      Many main Achewood characters have been seen writing in a strip at some point. I think we have yet to see Todd, maybe Molly and probably several others do so as well. I'm interested in Molly particularly. She's not in the strip often enough as it is.
