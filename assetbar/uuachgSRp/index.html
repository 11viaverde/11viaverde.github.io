      I was responsible for the second worst bachelor party ever when I was the best man.  God, it was  <em>lame</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, the lameness of the bachelor party I threw was far surpassed by the lameness of the bachelor party that was thrown for me.  It was only barely less sucky than Beef's party.

      All of my Dad's most shameful stories are shared by his brothers at family reunions. Almost all of them involve bachelor parties. <br/> <br/> <br/> Like the time my dad got really drunk at his bachelor party and so his brothers managed to handcuff him to a bowling ball. He stumbled around the bar, hardly able to drink -- thoroughly pissed off. He asked his borthers to take off the ball every twenty minutes or so -- if only so he could feel his arm again.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was about 3:30 when they realized they didn't merely lose the key, but that these particular handcuffs had their own  <em>specific key shape</em>  which could not be bought anywhere nearby (Nantuckett). This led my slightly irked father to attempt drunkenly removing the handcuffs with a garden spade, sledgehammer, a few missed trys with an axe, hardly sharpened hedge shears, and, of course, his teeth.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The key arrived in the mail the next day. <br/> <br/> <br/> Then there was the other bachelor party, where my dad and youngest brother (with the expected amount of booze in them) drove out and stole a sheep to give to the bachelor.  But that is a story for another time.

      I have bachelor party stories so bad that I can't even tell them here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Really.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
The kind of stories that involve items that, once you hear of them in these stories, you will never be able to enjoy looking at or thinking of them again.

      There's an unwritten rule, stating that "If Party A mentions to Party B an Incident in which something incredibly interesting goes down, but fails or neglects to elaborate on the story, Party A is automatically required to tell said story." <br/>

Huh. I guess it's not quite an unwritten rule now.

      Really though, I don't think I'm going to tell the stories. They nauseate me just thinking near them, so thinking directly at them might cause a mess in and around my keyboard. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was going to say "also they might not live up to the hype" but really I have read the other stories that have been posted and they are like nursery rhymes compared to this shit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have this friend? I can say a couple of words from the story at him, and he will turn pale and look like he is about to cry. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fourthly, I don't really want to be associated with these stories for the rest of my Acheworld career. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Why did I mention them at all, you ask? I just wanted people to know that there is more that has been done in the world than easily comes to mind when imagining the worst things possible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
... okay, I'll tell the stories.

      They are almost certainly fabricated. If you stop being disgusted for a moment and simply think about it logically, they're about as likely as the average "CHECK THIS OUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE STORY" forwarded email you get from your grandmother who just learned how to use email. <br/> 
For the first: Have you ever heard of, seen, or even  <em>imagined</em>  a pimple capable of appearing to be a tit in any way? (The answer is no.) For the second: Wrong (by which I mean incorrect) on so many levels. Women have  <em>yeast infections</em>  from time to time, so they know the value of cleanliness. Particularly hookers, since they're running a business out of their vagina. Also, anyone who enjoys cunnilingus has to know that the clitoris is not  <em>in</em>  the vagina. It's on top. And how could a green bean possibly survive being eaten, almost certainly chewed, digested a bit, and regurgitated, and still be recognizable as a green bean? And vomit would create much more than just a single green bean--there would be foul-tasting fluid at the very least. And if a man was to feel the need to vomit, his instinct would be to pull away, not push his face deeper to make sure he filled it up good. (Actually the last point is debatable.) <br/> 
And since when do people who use prostitutes eat their vegetables?

      I fail to see the relation between A) and B). Wouldn't A) make you more likely to be grossed out rather than desensitized?

      That makes sense now that you say it ... for some reason I was thinking of something that dries you out instead -- something along the lines of talcum powder.  Ray seems like the kind of fellow who might need both.

      There's humectant and then there's anti-humectant.  The former for those of us with dry hair, the latter for those of us with frizzy hair in humid climates.  I used to use this stuff.  It mostly just smells good.  <br/>

      I don't know if I'd go so far as to call it heartbreaking, but watching Roast Beef calmly wait for Ray to arrive - not sad, not upset, just waiting - is definitely a mark of what Beef has come to expect. He's had his heart broken so many times by the people in his life that he's just come to expect it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray, by contrast, is pissed off at himself and the world in general, regarding himself as a fool because of his inadvertent betrayal of his friend. And Beef's going to forgive him as soon as Ray explains what happened, but Ray won't forgive himself.

You sure about that man? It sounds to me more like <br/>

Dear ROAST BEEF, <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am so sorry that I DID A SAD-ASS IMPLEMENTATION OF A RAD-ASS BACHELOR PARTY. I assure you that I will MAKE SURE MY PHONE IS CHARGED FROM NOW ON to make up for this. While you have no reason to trust me, you must believe that I WILL GET THE NEW G3 IPHONE ASAP I HEAR IT HAS A BETTER BATTERY ANYWAY. There will come a day when NEXT TIME YOU GET MARRIED WE WILL DO IT UP FINE and you will be proud of me, and glad that you did. Please forgive me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your dear friend, <br/> 
 <br/> 
RAY

      While mixing an Old Fashioned, a septuagenarian biker accidentally hit the brakes instead of the clutch, causing his bike to swerve, splashing the bourbon into his eyes.  He then swerved across the center median into a truck shipping ball bearings to the fighter jet plant.  The ball bearings scattered across the highway, causing no less than four beer trucks to jacknife, scattering their contents up and down the highway.  Passing motorist, seeing the chance to sop up a few free beers, start an impromptu party on both sides of the freeway for almost five miles. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not only is the highway blocked by all the abandoned cars, but three bands are now playing, and the lines at the bathrooms are over an hour long. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Police estimate that once the strippers are all rounded up, it will still be an additional three to five hours before any Escalades will be freed up to continue their journeys.

      I was merely reasserting the idea that she may take comfort in the arms of Teodor, which has been implied quite a bit.  I meant no offense to Molly, truly-- I don't think she'll sleep with him, and I really hope she won't.  I beg your forgiveness.

      I'd say the Aveda thing was absurd enough to be considered comical.  I think it's good to have at least one zinger or surreal moment in even the most serious and dynamic episodes.  El Goonish Shive abandoned funny for unending character development and IMHO has been unreadable for years.  It's like if they adapted the Grapes of Wrath into a Sunday funnies syndicate.

      One over Zero had an interesting take on this: Do we, through storytelling, art, songs, etc., create other worlds in which we, as the progenitor, are responsible? What I'm trying to get at is that Roast Beef, and indeed the entire Achewood cast, could be as real as you or me and, by that logic, Onstad could be considered horrendously cruel for that happiness vacuum hovering over Roast Beef's head just out of each panel.

      "And how could the writer, who wants himself to be essential to this universe, want to be essential to the injustice which this universe comprehends? yet, he must be; but if he accepts being the creator of injustices, it is in a movement which goes beyond them towards their abolition. As for me who read, if I create and keep alive an unjust world, I cannot help making myself responsible for it...And if I am given this world with its injustices, it is not so that I may contemplate them coldly, but that I may animate them with my indignation, that I may disclose them and create them with their nature as injustices, that is, as abuses to be suppressed." <br/>

      Give me a break, with your tabletop RPGS.  You're telling me you never named your  <em>video game</em>  characters vulgar names?  I started out naming all my mains "COCK" but then grew out of or became aware and then ashamed of my homosexual tendencies so I adopted the more mature "FUCK."  After going through a long, bitter, misogynistic phase of calling all my female characters "CUNT" I have, in these last few years, realized that "ASS" is always the best choice, for anything. <br/>

      My buck's night was moderately more successful than this, but we did reach a stage where one of the guys was screaming "Punani! Punani! I want to see naked punani or play blackjack!" so we ended up down at the casino eating $2 chicken parmas and gambling away our drinking money. Plus the guy who was screaming about strippers and gambling piked ten minutes after we arrived at the casino. It ended up being me and my two oldest friends completely hammered taking 45 minutes to find the exit from casino at 4 am. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another buck's I went two for one of the aforementioned two friends went so badly we all went looking for our girlfriends who were having the respective hen's night. We found them having a great time just coming back from skinny dipping at a popular city beach and generally being off the hook while we were playing trackball golf. The groom was so depressed by this he drank half a bottle of gin and we went to the casino ...again. Night picked up from there.

      The circumstances of Beef's life dictate that his own bachelor party will be an exercise in depressed solitude.  Even Ray's go-lucky lifestyle and attitude isn't influential enough to pull it off.  On the contrary, Ray ends up feeling like life sucks the same way Beef usually feels.

      i am not someone who needs an excuse to party. the best parties are spontaneous and are not tied to an occaision... that said.. <br/> 
 <br/> 
one of my bud's was having his bachelor party. keg of SNPA, bratwurst, a gaggle of dudes (i only knew a couple of them). it was down in San Diego. <br/> 
 <br/> 
so 2 strippers show up. the groom to be is tossed on Stolichnya and beer. these 2 girls are absolutely shameless and proceed to get very lewd with eachother. double headed dildos, candles and what they were born with (tongues, fingers, etc).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
they get one of the groomsmen out there and take him down to his shorts. these gals get on either side of him, lay on their backs then tilt their pelvises upward. they put a finger on their bean and just start pissing all over him. HILARIOUS.. turns out they'd filled their cooters with beer, but you can't tell the difference.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
they then get my buddy out there. they get him down to his underwear and pull those down. at that point he barfs up bratwurst and burger and Stoli.. effing gross. we're all laughing our asses off.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
bachelor parties are so fucking contrived and they are just another symptom of the uber heinous gay fucking wedding thing.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
fuck weddings and all the associated stupidity that goes along with them.

      This is off-topic, but apparently you now have a nemesis, loneal.  I don't know why I noticed this, but every comment you have made today, save this one, has exactly 1 lame.  I was thinking, "None of these comments are actually lame, so there must be some dickery afoot."  I assumed they were all from lawbot, so I lowered my lame threshold to 1 so that I could prove my hypothesis and call him out for being a douchebag, but I instead found that they were from someone called Lainestin.  I suggest that you do away with this Lainestin character soon, lest he/she later become the Kesslee to your Tank Girl.

      Yeah there's some perpetual dick following her. It's hilarious the dedication this person has with regards to trying to upset someone by anonymously calling them lame. It's a strange hobby, for sure, and I can't imagine it to be very satisfying. I think her reaction has been 'fairly bemused' so far.

      Well, its lame allotment runs out for a while, but then it gets refreshed. So on some strips it only lames me once or twice, but then it gets more lames again. Its reason for existence will continue indefinitely, as far as I can tell.

      I think there's a key difference between Seppuku and Hari Kiri. One is just stabbing yourself in the stomach/heart, whereas in the other you actually have to slice yourself open and spill your innards out onto the floor. <br/>

      Yeah, someone created a sock puppet profile for the express purpose of laming every one of my comments indiscriminately. It has been happening for several weeks now.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is actually a positive development, as it has caused me to completely stop worrying about my lame count, which is now artificially inflated to the point that it is meaningless. It also led to yearsinhotclaws saying the following splendidly expressive quote: "I'm jealous of you, I wish I had some mute, broken figurine of humanity that would follow me around laming everything I said in some attempt to feel more powerful than me.  You just can't buy that sort of attention." <br/>

You actually have about 100 fewer lames than I do, but apparently you perceive yourself has having many more than you actually do. I recommend getting a pet machine elf. It will desensitize you to lames 100%.

      So I just saw the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101017234138/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbO1AaCnWnQ">video</a>  for Therapy?'s cover of "Diane" by Husker Du, and I can't stop watching it, so I figured I'd bring it up in case anyone else has something interesting to say about it. If not, that's cool. I can't really justify its relevance, except to say it reminds me of the "Roast Beef, I'm a prostitute" strip. But seriously, this is so brilliant, like Cronenberg, Freud, and Dali combined. Why didn't anyone tell me about this earlier?

      I see this wedding not happening on schedule.  I predict Molly and Beef calling it off, and getting all pissed off at each other, and Beef going on vacation somewhere, or maybe going on a walkabout, and it's then that Tedor and Molly will start hanging out more... getting a little tipsy on fancy wine over dinner... and suddenly Molly and her platonic girl friend will start doing it - teddy bear style. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know how common of an occurrence this sort of thing is in real life...  I suppose it depends on the person...  Really, we haven't had enough character development in Molly to say what she would do in this scenario - have we?
