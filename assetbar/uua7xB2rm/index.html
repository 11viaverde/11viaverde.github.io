      Fvck "weddings". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I got married in a Rabbi's livingroom. It took about 10 minutes. No planning involved. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I got divorced with the Atlantic Ocean inbetween AT THE TIME. <br/> 
Also, we lived that way. <br/>

I am proud of my weird ex-marriage. <br/>

      Even after reading all the previous comments, my feelings are unchanged. <br/> <br/> 
Perhaps it's Molly's proverbial balls dropping, perhaps it's the visual she invokes, perhaps it's the validity of both cats' points, but... <br/> <br/> 
This is the most beautiful Achewood strip ever.  This interaction perfectly illustrates why Molly is the only female who could ever stand Roast Beef, and why she is the only one who could, from time to time, when necessary, get him to shut the hell up about trivial issues.  It's love, perhaps the finest Onstad has ever written it. <br/> <br/> 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go set the table.  We're having a Greasy Queen over tonight. <br/>

...Also, somebody should make a dish or a drink or something called the Greasy Queen, because it's a great name.

      For some reason, the notion of a dish called the "Greasy Queen" reminds me of one of my hometown's contributions to the national cuisine, the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101006174603/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jucy_Lucy">Juicy Lucy</a> . This Minneapolitan dish is something of an everted cheeseburger: a ground beef patty with a core of cheese, served on a bun. The experienced or well-informed diner will eat the side dishes for a while before tucking into the Lucy proper, as the heat capacity, adhesion, and low viscosity of hot cheese makes biting into one fresh off the grill somewhat dangerous.
