      Back in high school this was so popular we just called them "K-hits".  Oddly the faculty was more worried about drugs than knives.  We did get a good water-bong solution cocked up at one time.  I have been known, when completely donked out, to scream into the night: <br/>

      We have a radio station that calls itself K-HITS, KHTT 106.9.  This is a station that plays Britney Spears, so I would rather gouge out my eardrums than listen to it, but, hey, you brought it up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are probably 50 to 100 other radio stations that refer to themselves as K-HITS.  So, really, you probably aren't going to get the reaction you hope for by shouting  <strong>LOVE K-HITS</strong> .

      As usual, Connie left an exquisite record of his early experimentation, written whilst under the influence.  At first he intended it to be only for his own edification under more sober circumstances, but he later realised that the little bagatelles might provide some amusement to others: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Excerpts from <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Main Features Of My Second Impression Of Hashish</span></strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>"The dual structure of this depression: on the one hand, anxiety; on the other, an inability to make up one's mind on practical matters..."<br/>
<br/>
"On my return home, when the chain on the bathroom floor proved hard to fasten, the suspicion: an experiment was being set up."<br/>
<br/>
"The constant digressions under the influence of hashish.  To start with, the inability to listen. This seems incongruous with the boundless goodwill towards other people, but in reality they share the same roots.  No sooner has the person you are talking to opened his mouth than you feel profoundly disillusioned.  What he says is infinitely inferior to what we would have expected from him before he opened his mouth, and what we happily assumed him to be capable of.  He painfully disappoints us through his failure to focus on the greatest object of our interest: ourselves."</em>  (Amusing sidenote: he's speaking here of Gore Vidal, with whom he got lit on this occasion.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>"Hunger as an oblique axis cutting through the system of the trance."</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fearful of the embarrassment the publication of this essay might create for Iris Gambol, were it to find its way to her friends in the Auxiliary, Connie arranged for it to be posthumously credited to Walter Benjamin.

      I can't speak for the lamers -- in fact, I haven't even lowered my threshold to see who it was -- but by congratulating Onstad on his great comic, you were kind of stating the obvious, at least according to most people on the board. People were also probably pissed that an 'newb upstart' like yourself should tell onstad what he should or shouldn't do with his time. Basically, from what I can tell, you made yourself look like an oblivious fanboy. But also, some people on the 'bar are hella douchebags.

      this is true, and while most everyone on here is not a douchebag, there is still a great diversity of opinion and point of view, so no matter what you say and how you say it, there is a good chance that in someone's world view, your statement will be lame, and in fact you often  <em>won't even be able to figure out for yourself</em>  why they think this.  You can ask, but it probably won't help, because most people don't want to diagram their inner thought process for you.  Asking them to do this is kind of like for example asking someone why he or she likes the color green...  It can be hard to explain.  So don't worry about it.  You can try to be inoffensive to most people on here, but if you try to argue with someone on what they consider lame, and disagree with them on their opinion, damn, that is an argument that you can't win, it just ends in name calling and AM NOT AM NOT ARE TOO ARE TOO kind of stuff. <br/>

      If you pay attention, you'll notice that nearly everyone gets a couple of random lames here and there for absolutely no reason at all. Complaining about it, however, will garner you more deliberate lames because everyone's been over this a million times and it's a boring discussion that no one wants to look at. So just ignore it and stick to making good posts like you've been doing otherwise, and soon you'll have enough chubbies that you'll stop caring about a few pesky lames.

      The font he uses is named Interstate, and it is a good font which can be used for many purposes. I recently developed a website in which the central font is a version of Interstate called Interstate Mono. <br/> 
Despite my desires, I have decided to abstain from providing a hyperlink to the website in question, due to the shameless self-promotion that it would portray. Anyhow, it is a website for a management training firm located in the North West of the UK, so what do you care in any case?

      That seems like a lot of trouble just to annoy one person who irritates me mildly at worst. Plus I didn't really understand any of that creating new accounts malarkey. <br/> 
What Assetbar needs is to appoint me King of the Mods so I read through all the comments and ban people who get all up on my goat. <br/>

The  <em><strong>FUCK</strong></em> , Hedo.  It's obviously Ash from Evil Dead, during one of the "Ash goes nuts" scenes (my bet is the Windmill scene from Army of Darkness).  Of course it's me that picks this sorta thing up.  In fact, it is so damned stereotypical of my Assetbar persona, that I'm going to go back to a classic avatar from my own personal cache. <br/> <br/> <br/> Meanwhile, when's this muthfucka gonna give up?  Have someone else to hate, or something else to DO.

      String me along? Sure, if you wanna call it that. I don't see how what you're doing now by responding is any different than what I've been doing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're wondering why I've been singled out, it's pretty simple really. A while ago when his trolling was not yet full-blown I happened to mention on here that I'd be in Chicago for a few days, after which he added and messaged me on Facebook asking to hang out. I politely declined and gave my reasons for doing so, but still added him back because I figured I'd give him a chance and there's no way anyone could be that much of a tool in one-on-one communications. I was proven wrong, after which I told him off and blocked him. That's all there is to this story. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, my point is I don't see how I've 'fallen' for some trick or other. It seems more like you have by indirectly helping his strategy of singling people out and attacking them. I still think you're rad, just, you know, lay off and don't blame the victim.

      Touche, Elbz.  Well said.  I recant my "stringing along" comment, as there was clearly History.  I kinda also made that comment somewhat just as a playful jab at you, however in hindsight the way in which I implemented it seems a bit too obscure to have really been seen as playful.  Oh well, not enough sleep. <br/>

And yes, I realise the irony of my posting like 20 times in response to him (indeed, responding at all).  The irony is biting as it is tasty.  Tasty, tasty irony.  There is no better.

      Not wanting to sound like a heel, but Onstad is in a weird place with this comment: should he comment more, and risk losing the air of mysteriousness that currently surrounds him (with the exception of the occasional A.V. Club article or New Yorker piece), or should he comment so infrequently (like, his current pace) that any comment is like a thunderclap from the heavens, or a wizened hand fixing a lead bulla to a parchment that indicates a pronouncement  <em>ex cathedra</em> ?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
On another note, Lyle's Genesis story does seem like the ultimate "Fuck You Friday" line.

      Man, that movie ended so badly.  That was the point I started really disliking Kevin Smith.  I never got into him as a genius subversive filmmaker, but I could enjoy the funny and a few other bits.  That ending was terrible.  From there on I only went to any film to look for silly humor, a step above Will Ferrell, a step below John Landis.  I stopped going at all after Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back

      Is Motorhead the explanation for the "ACE OF SPADES" reference here?   I read the Wikipedia entry on this playing card, but am still unsure as to what most people, referring to it, are talking about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was only aware of its pop culture significance due to its presence in an old Marx Brothers routine in Animal Crackers!   (This is why I'm not allowed to smoke pot.)

      not sure, but it's what clicked in my noodle.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
lyle has kind of a dirty hessian mystique. and Motorhead with its early thrash sound would seem like a natural fit. they definitely have a "fuck you" attitude. <br/> 
 <div class="img_container"><img alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100205162807im_/https://hardrockhideout.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/mustaschsinger.jpg" style="border:0px;"/></div> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
he just wreaks of booze, hard rock, black clothes.. fuck you attitude.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
also, a cultural reference you may not know either.. when the original Metallica was on tour, there was competition for the top bunk on the bus. Cliff Burton drew cards with Hetfield for the spot. Burton got the ACE OF SPADES.. and tossed it in Hetfield face. <br/> 
 <div class="img_container"><img alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100205162807im_/https://img267.imageshack.us/img267/1038/james1gy8.jpg" style="border:0px;"/></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
the rest, as you don't know, is history. the bus crashed, flipped and Burton was killed. if he hadn't been in the top bunk, he'da survived. and yet another way to look at it is, if hadn't drawn the ACE OF SPADES, he'da lived.

      It's true what you point out.  Seems like "go write a book" has become an Achewood "trope".  One could argue it goes against that old "show, don't tell" principle. <br/>

The books-written  <em>are</em>  entertaining, though.  A lesser entertainer would not be forgiven for these sorts of shenanigans!

      A sentence can have more than one sentence in it, believe it or not. If you say <br/>

"I know that you are a nice guy"  <br/> 
that is a sentence, but also "you are a nice guy" counts as a sentence as well.

As a long time troll I can tell you that ("that" is optional) [secondary sentence].  You can just move the adverbial phrase, and add the THAT and it is an equivalent sentence.

      Well since I wrote it, I guess I should explain how I meant for it to be translated. <br/>

When you make a big deal out of a troll, whether by loudly proclaiming at every instance "Don't feed the troll ok" or by saying "I'm playing along with your gimmick and I'm going to believe you are actually crazy and i am afraid pls mods do something", you're only making it funnier for them.

      ok, so if you're not aiu, then who are you?  Your user name is not much of a name.  No offense, it's just a jumble of letters.  That's like Prince wanting to be called by a symbol which has no pronounciation in any language.  Sje46 is also not pronouncable.  Your avitar is also pretty jumbled.  achilleselbow, for example, has an avitar that is of a dude.  It evokes some kind of idea about the dude, sort of like a name evokes ideas about a person, or at least, ideas can be attached to a name as you get to know the person.  Can ideas be attached to sje46?  It's hard to say.  It's certainly more difficult.  Your avitar is kinda.. almost as random as snow on a TV.  It doesn't have a face, it doesn't really express much in the way of ideas, except maybe the idea of being way far out there.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.

Much as it makes me cringe, I have to defend Prince here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
His given name is Prince Rogers Nelson.  Warner Brothers trademarked "Prince" and used it without Nelson's permission.  He change his name to an unpronounceable symbol as a part of his legal battle with Warner Brothers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As soon as he won the legal battle, he went back to calling himself "Prince." <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, as much as I think his music is 98% trite crap, I sympathize with his decision to refer to himself as Love Symbol #2 for a few years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I hold him in so much contempt, why do I know all this stuff about him?  I tutored a kid for three years whose favorite artist was Prince, and I was inundated with information about him.  The 2% of Prince's music that I don't think is worthless crap is  <em>Kama Sutra</em> , an album that was never commercially released.

      Yeah, they said he had to pay to use his own name, and he said "fuck you", changed his name to something graphic that couldn't be pronounced, and respectfully requested everyone refer to him by the moniker "the artist formerly known as Prince." That way, he still had benefit of the name without paying one red cent to the jack-boots, and when they got that they couldn't milk him, they settled for a token, and he legally changed his name back. <br/>

My old avatar was the default one with the weird looking woman, and I made a comment about how I had to change it because people thought I was a woman.

      Argh! Will everyone stop accusing each other? This is what he wants. And let's say for argument's sake that either pinesol or sje46 WERE aiu (which, as a leading expert on trollology and the first to correctly identify his first alias of "glyc" I can say with 95% certainty that they're not). So what? If he were actually hiding behind a new name and acting like a more or less normal person (which I still believe he is fundamentally incapable of doing) and not directly identifying himself by posting stupid images or blocks of nonsense or being deliberately offensive, then what be the harm in letting him carry on in such a way? It's not like he's gonna gain your trust and get your credit card number or something.

      I agree.  You should write a book on trollology. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus I doubt that even AIU would waste his time setting up two accounts, getting in figts with himself just to make you believe sje is not him and then say "Hahaha!  It is I, AUI!  [and then a bunch of nonsense].  I mean, he has a lot of accounts, but that seems to be going a bit far.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Although I do admit I should stop posting dumb stuff like Patti, Doug and Skeeter performing a Wobbly H.  I did that just to show you something dumb someone did regarding treating cartoon  characters in odd ways (because of someone's avatar with Doug Funnie being crusified), but I really didn't make that clear.  But the lame/chubby ratio is equal now.  <br/>

      okay okay I'm aiu I can be aiu do you want me to put on the wig and cheap purple pumps too...  No.. that will not do.  If I'm gonna be aiu I'll have to get out the whole chicken man mascot suit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In these various suspicions of various people being aiu, I'm noticing that apparently aiu is different things to different people.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I myself never put the guy on ignore except for when he spams tons of images and I can't read the forum anymore.  There's seldom anything of interest or comedic value in any of his posts, Maybe there was some shock value at first but by now it's formulaic and if you've read one you've read them all.  But sometimes the ruckus of a reaction that is generated is pretty funny.  Like right now for instance.  And here I am contributing to it despite myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But yeah, maybe I should start ignoring the guy on the theory that you can't un-see what you've seen, and I don't need all that endless crap seeping into my subconscious in any way shape or form.  if guitar hero is convinced I'm aiu then maybe it's already too late, maybe it is influencing my writing style?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I do know for a fact is that with gladi8orex's writing style it's already way too late.  I am to the point now where I can read what glad has written and pretty much understand it automatically as if it was normal English.  He is reprogramming my neural language circuits or possibly even deeper parts of my brain for what purpose I do not know.  One day glad will type the magic activation sequence "atkca! atkca!" and we'll all rise from our computers to do his bidding per the pre-programmed instructions that have been encoded into his seemingly harmless daily missives. <br/>

      Initially I figured he was lying, but kiilerlimpet's comment "Omphalos" made me think that that was the title of the strip.

      I was found by an employee of the State on a fragrant Tuesday afternoon, the stench of Janus' Creek still dripping from my fresh-retched mane. There was not any animal nearby, nor any Evidence of my origin except for the concealed remains of a campfire, smouldering itself gently to sleep. Oh how it burned; so cautious it was, the flames licking low as if they were afraid to let the Creek see them consume. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I found in the ranger's slacks a good, leather-bound sturdy wallet which held my new name, a name by which his Children did not recognize me. It was a good wallet, and brown. <br/>

I made the one into a shirt for the other and then was on my way.

      God then materialized a dime bag of green, sticky weed.  He slapped Lyle on the back of the head and said, "Merry Christmas, Happy Birthday, whatever... smoke up, Lemmy!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Soon, three kings appeared from the East, bearing Zig Zags, a water bong, and an awesome one-hitter that would look like just a regular reed pipe to passing Roman soldiers.

      woah... fuzz  ungtabulous avery?  is butterfly? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Have you ever seen a huge ass multicoloured butterfly in person, up close?  They are ard to atch.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
it's a wonderful experience.  so much so that it is a pitty that there' isn't a' butterfly sort of exhibit.  avarium?  Where there is a big cage, and you walk in it with special double doors so none of the birds get out by accident. you know.  they have one in Tucson. At the museum.  The.. Saguaro? (Sp?) cactus? redbox? <br/> 
 <br/> 
and well instead of bird, butterfly.  Lik that one time on the price is right.  What was that gam show.  Note the price is wright brothers.  The other one.  Where you step into the glass cage, and they turn on the fans, and all the butterflys splash around, and you stuff as much as you can into your gaping mouth, and when the bell goes ding, the fans turn off, and you get to keep all the ones you swallowed. And fives and fiftys and so on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
this is one of those     <<? huh?  I'm sorry.  I forgot who I am, let alone what I was talking

Have any of you seen "Gossip Girl"? What is that show about? Please explain to me. I have not seen it and am  curious about it. I hope its not more of the same, "Lifetime" bullshit like "Gays" Anatomy, you know? Such bullshit. Women programming has gone downhill since Gilmore Girls went of the air. Can I get an Amen? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, Hannah Montana? Hailey is nasal? I need answers people! I need to know these things! Please tell me!" <br/>

      Not directly related to this strip, but for lack of a "general announcements and discussion" forum I'll post it here: <br/>

I made a Greasemonkey script for Firefox that addresses one of my favorite Assetbar annoyances: how to figure out what post a comment is in reply to, when the original post and the response are separated by many intermediate comments. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This was my first attempt to do anything with Greasemonkey, so it's not terribly sophisticated, but  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100205162807/https://www.brianp.net/achewood/assetbarista.html">here</a>  it is if anybody else wants to try using it.

      I won't lame this, but in regards to the Clone Wars, making your CG characters intentionally hideous for ease of us in transferring them to action figures and television show is far too cynical for me. I was willing to stand behind his prequels as poor decisions, but this goes a little far.

      I . . .I care about you.  I didn't answer because I didn't know the answers myself.  I have never seen gossip girls, but I'm not entirely sure I want to.  Although I must admit that Gilmore Girls is a top-quality show.  Superb dialog.   <br/>

Hannah Montana, I do not know too much about.  I tend to stay away from the Disney Channel whenever I can. <br/>

      Completely off topic, this is the day I caught up to curr.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I discovered Achewood quite by mistake when a google search on "nibble" took me away from my intended computer term to an odd quirky story of a five year old otter and a chewed upon chapstick. I read a few strips, and then started at the beginning. It has been a fun journey, and I can hardly wait to see what cooks up next! <br/> 
 <br/> 
"So, what now?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm going to Disneyland! <br/> 
 <br/> 
No, really, I am.

      A chubby for nailing it. <br/>

It is Hans, who isn't very commited to being a German. When all the "Heil Hitler's" fly, he slips in at the end with just "'tler" (usually comes off sounding like "gluck"). He ends up spending the rest of the war in England when his character is written out of the series. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I liked this quixotic Pogo-ish expression quite well, and in a fit of dislike for the megaphone default avatar that assetbar gave me, grabed this pic instead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ultimately not very well thought out, since my username is a rough translation of Puss-in-boots, but then again, they both got boots in common. Maybe it accidentally works better than I thought?

      Yeah, Gruber was the gay officer that "fancied" Rene and was ever so proud of his little tank. He was in the series from the first to last episode. In the end he married Helga, and they had ten kids together. Guy Siner played him, and may be seen in the first "Pirates of the Carribean" movie as the harbormaster who welcomes Capt'n Sparrow and accepts his bribe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hans Geering was more of an impertinent school boy skating through the war with minimal effort. His tent would have been the Chateau headquarters of the occupying force, and believe it, he was much more interested in Yvette, Maria, Helga and profiteering then he was in Rene. He was only in about a third of the series, and was played by Sam Kelly. I've honestly never seen any of his other roles, but someone told me he played Hitler once. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I talk too much....
