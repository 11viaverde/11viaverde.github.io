      The roller skate running gag (shitty pun of the week) began with the Phillipe/French Fry arc. Other appearances include Pat shooting Cornelius (as a red herring), Pat shooting Roast Beef (no roller skate is seen, only mentioned by Beef), and when TÃ©odor dies when gagging on a bottle cap thrown into a roller skate Todd is sleeping in.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
One could also argue that Ray's roller skating in an attempt to stave off diabetes is an allusion to the dark foreshadowing of death the roller skates usually incur.

      Yep, Ray is pretending to be Tony Soprano and waving his piece (gun ,that is) around, slips on a rollerskate and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415013830/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=09162002">shoots Beef</a> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it's Beef's first in-strip shooting (and he goes to hospital, not heaven), though when emailing Corliss in the next strip he includes a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415013830/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=09172002">'PS'</a>  which suggests it has been a reasonably common experience over the years.

      ... Anyone remember all that time ago when people were having a merry old time mouthing off about Scientologists and I off-handedly made the remark that Christians were worse... and it got me a veritable tsunami of lames along the course of an extensive squabble-fest?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
See... the thing is... religion is basically just syphilis. <br/> 
I pity those who have it. <br/> 
I am disgusted by those who deliberately spread it.  <br/> 
Those who have the outward physical symptoms of it all over their bodies seriously gross me out.  <br/> 
It is pretty damned difficult to cure... though in religion's favour it is sometimes possible. <br/> 
And I will continually look down upon those who speak well of it or don't do their socials with protection, y'know?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And churches? Mosques Christian or Muslim communals and clubs? Those are like those web communities where people  <em>share STDs for fun</em> . Or like  <em>AIDS Pride</em>  or something. Twisted shit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, I figure it'd be in everyone's best interests if the religious folk were just euthanised. Poor buggers don't know what is what any more. Severe brain-damage and all that. <br/>

      As for atheism... I'm not sure in this day and age it even warrants its own word. I mean what is the point in indicating one's non-belief in some undefined non-thing?  We going to label ourselves aunicornists or adragonists while we're at it?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That stuff isn't there is like... the default. It goes without saying. Onus is on those who do believe in stuff to be saying what the stuff is, cos the stuff we don't believe in is far more than we could recite in a lifetime.  <br/> 
So in a sense... I ain't down with defining atheism... cos by all rights I'm aomnist... (there I am just making up a word to explain I disbelieve everything).

      Yeah, I'm religious, personally, but I just don't think it's cool to try to impose my personal beliefs on others, it's just not how I operate.

      It's funny, because Einstein advocated the use of nuclear weapons against Axis forces.  So it fits in pretty well with the genocidal, PMS-ing God of the Old Testament. <br/>

      I don't think that's exactly right.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
AFAIK, Einstein knew that Germany had a fairly advanced atomic research program and was more or less convinced that they would develop atomic weapons at some point in the war.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
He was wrong about that (and according to some reports we have a small band of courageous Norwegians and their guerrilla war against heavy water manufacturing to thank for this), but it seems like a fairly rational judgement - if atomic weapons are going to exist, it's better that the Nazis aren't the sole owner/operators.

      Yeah, that's right.  He still advocated developing them, and only after he learned of the devastation wrought in Japan did he wholeheartedly regret writing to FDR in support of the USA's nuclear program. <br/>

      Bein religious is fine and well if you don't tell people. <br/> 
That is unfortunately what it comes down to. Sometimes just saying you are something is as good as shoving it down their throats, so sensitive can folks be to the social highways and byways of subtle communication.  <br/> 
Afterall, folks will measure the merits of whatever values you hold against their particular rating of your personal self... which is frankly a poor way to judge things, but is one of the many nasty little shortcuts hardwired into the human psyche. Ask any psychologist and they'll confirm it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Only way not to be imposing it is just to keep your mouth shut... sad to say.  <br/> <br/> <br/> As for me... I got no problems with keeping my imposing at the same level I see everyone else imposing. Gives me a feeling of doing things justice, even if other folks get riled cos my stuff is different.  <br/>

      I definitely see where you're coming from there, jeffspaulding, and I also believe that the most important part of any sort of metaphysical belief is the spiritual impulse- the attempt to sense some transcendent presence in the universe.  However, I've always found that religious ritual is a good way to gain and nurture that connection, rather than a mere "system of behavioral rules."   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The widespread use of ritual in almost every even remotely successful religion seems to bear out the idea that the empty legalism of so much religious dogma does have a spiritual impulse behind it.  Perhaps it's the way we're supposed to contact this force, perhaps it's just a form of self-hypnosis.  Either way, I know that my spiritual feeling generally grows stronger when I'm regularly attending church.  And if it is just a sort of self-hypnosis, well, I know people who've really managed to improve their quality of life with hypnosis.

It's what I imagine sometimes has happened to religion. The gods are dead; but we go through the motions because it's the motions we believe in now - we didn't notice that the gods died.

      And spirituality is based on a false dichotomy; that the mind and body are separate or separable. So we write off all our sensuality and physicality as somehow inferior to some imagined spirit. There is no spirit separate from the body. The flesh is spiritual. The mind is not housed in the body; it IS the body. It's all there is.

      Because there is nothing remotely scientific to support the fantastic hypothesis that the soul lives forever; it's clearly an idea developed to make you feel better about life (those ideas are usually bullcrap) and I don't think most people have enough personal will and imagination to live for the 100 years we already have, let alone be stuck about for eternity, jabbering about their new iphone and Paris Hilton. People utterly waste the short lives they have, why on earth do they think they deserve eternity? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh and the machine you are using to communicate with right now is one of the reasons why I homor the scientific method. Religion didn't crete no damn microchip technology; religion can't even cook good food.

      Not that I disagree with everything you're saying, but I feel like you're missing the upside of religion, which is, at its best, an encouragement for people to keep in mind the others in their community and a prod toward the very spiritual (or personal, or ethical) truths of which you're such a fan. Remember that we now live in a culture largely detached from the religions of old, and the surviving strains of religion tend to be more virulent and insane than their ancestors, which were checked by their need to reach a wider following. I guess what I'm saying is, it's easy to tear anything down on an Internet forum, but even religion has its benefits.

      Sure. I don't believe in anything supernatural, and I've never been to any kind of church service except funerals, etc. I'm just sick of people going online and saying, you know, "religion is always a tool of fascism and control, all religious people are either mind-controlled zombie retards or money-hungry manipulators..." Because it's such an easy conclusion, which ignores the myriad reasons why our ancestors "wasted" so much time on their religion. Belief in something bigger than oneself is a productive thing because, natural or supernatural, personal or impersonal, there is a Universe out there much bigger than any of its inhabitants. I'm not saying that without religion, the world suddenly goes to Hell. But if we throw out all the teachings of religion at once, good and bad, we do lose thousands of years of ethical and "spiritual" development without any clear replacement for them. "Spiritual" meaning mental, internal, personal. And a lot of the little Christopher Hitchenses out there seem, at least rhetorically, to want that to happen. Am I making sense? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm just trying to say the hardest thing possible to say on the Internet: "the issue's more complicated."

      Well, yes, certainly it is more complicated than that, and I don't think that rational atheists think that all religions are tools for control or that all religious folk are zombie retards.  I think that priests aren't deliberately lying to people (well, most of them), and that people just accept these things blindly.  A lot of people are indoctrinated, however, and there are some kinda subtle brain-washing type things happening unconsciously by the religious society.  Like if one says it is a sin to doubt.  Or you mustn't associate with atheists, or associate with them.  And they educate you when you are too young to be able to question these things, and then you can't unbelieve it when you get older because you have built you sense of meaning from this.   <br/> 
I disagree that we will lose thousands of years of ethical and "spiritual" development.  I . .I don't know what to say about the spiritual thing, because I don't really know what it is.  At least not from a non-religious point of view.  Could it be some type of feeling associated with appreciating the beauty around you?  What is it?  You mential the adjectives :mental, internal, personal, but certainly you can be mentally, internaly and personally healthy without religion!  I have no idea, and I don't see how that's been built up over the thousands of years, or how we need religion for that. <br/> 
And ethical development. . .I just don't see it.  Are we really more ethical than we were two thousand years ago?   <br/> 
How have we developed since then?  Would we be so much worse off if religion had never existed. . .would there have been more wars and serial killers?  I highly doubt that.  If there has been development in morality, it has been due to pluralism.  Cultures getting together and sharing their mores and people realizing that their moral code may not be the only valid one, and they started to re-examine them.  Science began to show that their is no significant difference between races and genders, and that the Bible may not be true, and people began to re-examien the moral code contained within.  Values such as gender roles began to decline out of necessity and cognitive dissonance and other values such as equality and fairness begin to take shape. <br/> 
If anything, there has been more ethical development with the decline of religion.

      All right, but it's unfair to respond to the closed-mindedness  <em>of</em>  religion with closed-mindedness  <em>against</em>  religion. Mankind can get on without the old religions, and ideally, maybe it should. But the billions of people who follow the old religions will tell you it's not because they've been indoctrinated. I guess what I mean about ethical and spiritual development doesn't have to do with warfare or the crime rate or many of the larger-scale examples of ethics, but with the prayers and meditative practices and social engineering that help normal people get by. These haven't all been studied, the good ideas haven't all been incorporated into the post-religion world, and if we just say it's all poppycock, they never will be. If you tell a religious person that it makes him less of a rational person than you, he'll be on the defensive. He may never see your side of things, he may just pronounce you an infidel. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's one thing to say the good aspects of religion aren't worth the bad. It's another thing to say religion is so evil we should ignore the good aspects altogether, or that there never were any good aspects.

      Certainly closed-mindedness is a bad thing for anybody to engage in.  And while telling a religious person that he is a less rational person than me probably won't result in anything good, that doesn't mean I'm not right. <br/> 
Which I may not be.  Assuming that it is I who has the right thought processes and not the pious man, all this means is that I am the most rational when it comes to the question of God.  He could be a brilliant mathematician, biologist, literary critic, whatever, and over-all a much brilliant man than I could ever hope to be.   <br/> 
As to ignoring the good aspects . . .what can I say?  Here's a cup of apple juice and here's a cup of cyanide apple juice.  Why speak the praises of the poison juice while a perfectly healthy cup stands right here?  Does the poison juice offer some sort of advantage?  Does it taste better?  And if so, is that worth the death? <br/>

      Well Jeffy...  <br/> 
Seems you and I are, in a sense, alike in our viewing of the world as a lesser thing. Nietzsche would hate us, for sure.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I don't view the Nihilistic way as depressing at all. The idea of ceasing to exist is what keeps me going.  <br/> 
Nature has it hard-wired into your head that you have to persist, but that is not the way of the Universe. It is the way for everything to fade, rot and die. For all form and distinction to unbecome. Entropy is  <em>the</em>  law. The ways of life that are hard-wired into your brain just don't vibe with the Universe... and if you can sever yourself from such self-torturing instincts then the idea of unbecoming as a thing and ceasing to exist will no longer seem anathema to you.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Making stuff up though? Flights of fancy? You can't build any walls up around yourself that time won't break down. Best save yourself the effort. Embrace nothingness. It ain't bad.  <br/> <br/> <br/>

      He is terrified. Mom mentioned that her friend Joan had a stroke recently. Phillipe used the computer to look up stroke, and said that when you have one things start to become strange. Upon seeing Teadore walk backwards while appearing to walk forwards, Phillipe wonders if he just had a stroke. But he doesn't wonder what will happen to him, no. He just hopes that he runs off into the woods to be eaten by tigers, if only so his mother will not have to know two people who had a stroke. <br/>

      I've clung to the stars of the 60's to fill in for my missing 'Elvis'.  Unfortunately there is always that creeping sense of recognition that soon these aging artists will begin to drop like flies much in the same way MJ did.  <br/>

      All of the big groups of the 60s and 70s have had either one or two members die. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Beatles? John and George. <br/> 
Pink Floyd? Rick Wright. <br/> 
Rolling Stones? They're all dead, they just haven't stopped moving yet. <br/> 
Monty Python? Graham Chapman.  <br/>

Me and my friend are in a terrible pool to see which one goes first (I've got Cleese) even though we can't stand to see any of them go. <br/>

Then again, they themselves probably have the same sort of thing going on.

      I agree with Idle holding on for spite (he admits that he is the least kind Python).  Palin's in the best shape though (or was at the time of his travelogues for BBC). <br/>

Gilliam is the next to go -- his lifestyle is the most unhealthy (e.g., the stress of fighting studios over every frame of art).  Plus, all those marker fumes will catch up top him.

      Agreed.  Ringo was always and will always be the Greatest Beatle.  Not in terms of music.  No, that was John (or maybe Paul).  In terms of what it means to be a Beatle, and what it means to live the philosophy of their music.  He was a humble man who never became greedy, spoiled, and remained down-to-Earth, loving, and didn't want to see anybody fight . . .the heart and soul of the group, everybody's friend.  All the other Beatles were hypocrites.

      Pretty much. Plus he was the first to do a guest spot on the Simpsons... one which basically just has him being a fairly nice guy whose only real flaw is being a tad too polite to his fans. The rest would get around to doing it eventually, but Ringo was there first.

I wanted say "Two Beatles have died" but then I realized that perhaps you were born after 1980, because John Lennon has been dead for TWENTY-EIGHT PLUS YEARS and regular people are in fact that age and even younger.  And then I was going to say something witty about changing my dating zone from "alive when Star Wars came out" to "alive when John Lennon died" but then I curled into a ball and wept.

      To borrow a line from Spinal Tap, most of his singing on "OK Computer" could be described as "shit sandwich."  Maybe it's because I was a music major in college and automatically hear every little flaw.  But come on, Exit Music for a Film?  Incredible song.  Terrible, terrible singing.

      I think the flaws and uniqueness to his voice are what make him stand out for us regular people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The real reason we don't have an Elvis of our generation is that, with the huge saturation of artists on the scene, music is the easiest means of achieving a smug sense of superiority that you don't really deserve, something we humans love to do. Way back when, the popular music was the music that everyone loved. Now, the popular music is the most ridiculed, because we've all convinced ourselves that we're better than that. There can be no sacred cows in this generation of music. Maybe it will change in the future!

      This is because you are both from the wrong generation. Even Wingspan you're clearly from just over the line. Back in the day when you could actually see the dude's videos on MTV he was pretty much famous for being, well, quite good and with some great videos. "Beat It", for example, has not only an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo, but was directed by  <em>monkey-fighting</em>  Scorsese. "Thriller" had a cameo from Vincent Price doing some spoken word and wasn't just a video (directed by John Landis with effects by Rick Baker because if you're going to turn into a werewolf on film you get the director  of the best werewolf film ever made and the makeup artist responsible for a transformation scene that still hasn't been topped), it was a goddamn fucking event every time it came on. "Billie Jean" made it look like the dude was breaking laws of physics and had those cool light-up tiles. Hell, even moving on to "Smooth Criminal" and he holds a patent for the little heel things that let him lean waaaay the fuck over. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Michael Jackson was legitimately famous for a wide host of reasons. He just... well, pop stopped being relevant after the late 80s and it honestly hasn't ever really come back. He lost his niche and that was that. Same thing happened to Elvis since Onstad already made the comparison.

      I know the dude originally got his fame from being insanely talented, I'm just saying I'm not old enough to remember the time before allegations about him kind of overshadowed his talent in media coverage.  <br/>

On a moderately related note (related to your post in any case), you might be just as frustrated as I am to learn that a remake of  <em>An American Werewolf in London</em>  could be on the horizon. It's quite possibly my favorite movie ever and I'm not so sure if Zac Efron (or whoever the get to do it) and overdone CGI will add a lot to the story.

Anywho, I am glad you get to have an Elvis... or maybe I am sad for you(?).  I'm happy there's a musician you can connect so much to, and sad you had to lose him.  I am also on so so much caffeine, and I just wrote the shittiest essay of my life for my online class at the local community college.  Long story short, it is bad for me to be on the internet right now. <br/>

      ...Until he moonwalks right off the front steps, hits his head and gets rushed to the hospital... <br/> 
 <br/> 
And embarks on a vision-quest.  Still moonwalking, he can only blunder his way backwards through the wonders he finds...  And by the time he is able to see any of them, he has already passed them...  Poor Philippe is lost on this journey, unable to return.  He very nearly moonwalks off a cliff into a giant chasm, until Michael appears, and Moonwalks beside him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Philippe still lacks the perspective to know quite who Michael is, but is overjoyed at being rescued and befriended...  Then Michael shows Philippe the "anti-gravity lean" shoes, and Philippe is overjoyed, spending the better part of a day leaning forward altogether too far, and then pulling himself back up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Philippe, now equipped with a few more techniques from Michael's arsenal of dancing moves, is able to continue on his vision quest - with the anti-gravity lean he peers down into the chasm, and finds his own life, and his future.  Michael tells him he will have to get down there to return to that life... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Philippe finds a path down to the chasm, and moonwalks down it, leaning over the edge from time to time to check his progress - until finally he is beset by angels wishing to escort him away to the afterlife.  Michael warns Philippe that it is not yet his time to die yet - the angels appear to not understand or not care.  Philippe tries to escape them, but in Moonwalking away he simply bumps into another of them.  Michael comes to Philippe's aid, luring the angels into a dance routine so Philippe can escape.  Philippe moonwalks away, horrified as the angels take control of the dance routine and take Michael away.  Philippe tries to spin around and return to help Michael, but in the process falls off the ledge and into the chasm...  and awakes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
...Nah, that would be stupid.

      I was on the subway in New York the day Michael Jackson died, and there was a kid with a boom box playing some of his songs at a respectable volume. Some uppity lady decided it wasn't appropriate, so she told the kid "You need to turn that off. It's against the rules to play music on the subway." <br/>

We slammed the door on Michael and moved away to the coast and only now are we realizing what our actions have bought us, but we can't ever take it back. <br/>

      Cornelius has thought about death daily for the past two decades. He has harsh yet bracing words to dispense on the event of any significant death. You should hear the speech he prepared for the contingency that the Large Hadron Collider at Cern loosed a cloud of hegemonising stranglets toward North America. It would ensure that all who heard it faced the imminent apocalypse with backbone, stiff upper lip, and a certain measure of wry amusement.

      Someday they will all change their avatars back to whatever they were, and this will be incomprehensible to posterity.  For the ephemerally challenged people of the future, goldhat through clamenza changed their avatars to a single letter each, spelling out "FUCK YOU!" in some italic script.  But clamenza may have the wrong typeface because the exclamation point is not inclined to the right.  Then it looks like they chubbied one another to fill an entire screen with an ill-gotten green background.

      There isn't an Elvis of every generation.  Elvis and MJ are often compared because they were both larger than life and both caused a seminal change in music. Elvis brought Black music to the (white) masses. MJ was the Black superstar entertainer.  People as old as me will remember that MTV did not show videos of Black musicians until Michael Jackson's Billie Jean. (It is unbelievable that this was in the 1980's not the 1950's). <br/>

Some people are unique products of their time and there is not an analogue in every age.

      It's worth noting, though, that MTV had only been in existence for ~2 years before the Billie Jean video. <br/>

I'm not saying they didn't have a questionable selection of material, but it's not like it had been some long-standing, insurmountable barrier to overcome.

      I wholeheartedly disagree my good sir. Many prodigious forms of pitchery can be found with a moments research. It can be said without hesitation that the notes whirring upon the FM could be dismissed as crass or "not good" but do not receive this as the siren call of a generation. Dismiss those who foster a new breed of (dis)organized sound and they will never greet your mind. Only when you step into the light will they find you.

      I have to ask, and I mean no offense by this. What happened to the whole "Michael Jackson is an arrogant child molesting freak who hasn't had a hit since 1995" viewpoint?

      Yes. Yes it is. I always thought that he was about the least scary pedo ever but it's true; his music had been rubbish since BAD and his personality, apart from the creepy kid thing, was a deranged hurricane of fragmented slivers of a shattered ego. <br/> 
 <br/> 
People are mourning the MJ that they wanted him to have been, not the one that he became. It's particularly apt that Jackson died the year Obama became President. His life was the most pitiful experiment in race-hate through self-loathing ever beheld.

      Well who ever mourned fat Elvis dead on the toilet?  It's not a bad thing to remember someone as they were at their best or as you liked them the best.  That's nostalgia.  It's not an especially unhealthy form of grief; it's 99% of the time the only form.  I'm tired of people grandstanding "He was a pedophile freak fuck anal fag dick"; fine, that's an opinion, but let the fans remember him the way they want to.  They can have their opinion too.

      Is opinion the right word to use? To my knowledge, it's not generally debated that he had mental problems and lost his talent for music later in his life. Nostalgia shouldn't lead way to denial.

      I meant the opinion that he was a horrible person.  I don't know what kind of person he was.  I know he had a troubled childhood and he was a musical genius for a while and of course of the bad period of his life, but people act like nothing in his life warrants at least a minimal outpouring of grief.  How do these people think he became the "King of Pop" in the first place?  But it's been two weeks now so who cares anymore?  Am I  <em>right</em> , culture?

      I think Onstad got it exactly right.  A lot of people of my generation are really more mourning our connection to him then the man himself.  Like him or not, like his music or not, he was a touchstone throughout our lives as more then just the butt of jokes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember watching the Jackson 5 cartoon as a kid, even though I really had no idea about their music. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember being 11 or 12, when we started to form our own musical taste (influenced by older siblings), and a lot of kids were talking about how great Pink Floyd's "The Wall" was.  One kid told us his parents had that album and he would bring it over.  He brought over a copy of "Off the Wall," and was mercilessly ridiculed for it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember how Michael Jackson was all over MTV in the early days and how each of his video debuts from Thriller were treated with the anticaption of a major motion picture release. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then he released the actual video/short film "Thriller", and everyone was talking about it all week. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember Letterman doing the original Billy Jean "The CHAIR is not my son" riffs on his show when Billie Jean was all over the radio. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And 'Bad' was released when I was still in high school and we all joked about how 'bad' you could really sound while squeaking 'Shou-Mon!' <br/> 
 <br/> 
And, yeah, then we watched him degenrate to where he was, just like Elvis degenerated into the jumpsuited Vegas lounge act that most people connect him with.  But for those of us who grew up with him always there as The Superstar, him dying just reminds us all of our own mortaility.

      "Another One Rides the Bus" was probably his first big hit on Dr. Demento so, yeah. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, "Eat It" was the first track on  <em>In 3D!</em>  and that was a far better album than his eponymous debut. Hell... now I recall when Nickelodeon had that video show on in the 80s and they played "Fat"... that was hella classic. <br/>

      Yeah, I thought about mentioning Weird Al, too.  Without the grandeur of MJ's videos, Weird Al's parody videos wouldn't have had the same bite.  The "Eat It" video was a perfect shot for shot copy of the original with all the Airplane style visual jokes thrown in.  It seemed to get as much MTV play as the original.

      Those of us who, like Teodor and Beef, have been brought face to face with the fact that we are all aging, need to remember that although our youth may be spent, there are more young people in the world today than ever before. A million kids Phillippe's age, this past week, upon watching TV and hearing of the death of a man they had never even heard of, were treated to footage of Michael doing the moonwalk, and their simultaneous reaction was the same as Philippe's, and the same we all had when we first saw it. <br/>
