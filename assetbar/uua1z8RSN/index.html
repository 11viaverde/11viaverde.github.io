      Penny Arcade is occasionally good. It started out well, faltered, got better, faltered...occasionally they manage sarcasm, but rarely actual humour. <br/> 
Achewood is consistently good, if not always funny. You might not always spray your drink onto your monitor while laughing, but you will at least go 'yeah that was pretty good'.

      Odd, because while I read P-A regularly, I laugh out loud more at Achewood's humor more than just about all other webcomics together.  It's not my favorite, I don't necessarily think it's the best or even funniest webcomic around - but I laugh out loud more often at this strip than any others.  I don't think I'm alone in this.

      Seriously dude, I know I'm late to the party but Penny Arcade fucking blows. It is one of the worst webcomics on the internet, and the fact that you think that it is "laugh-out-loud funny" on a regular basis means there is something wrong with your sense of humour. These aren't opinions, this is a stone cold fact: Penny Arcade blows. Achewood is not only more detailed and features an actual story, but every single gag is about 100x funnier than a penny arcade strip. Also you have a shitty nerd "musician" as your avatar so you are obviously a stupid nerd from some other part of the internet. You have the worst opinions on the internet and I would take 5 asherdans or soticos or saints over you. tl;dr: GTFO i don't like nerds

      oh come on now, everyone on the internet is a nerd? <br/>

listen guy, the only reason i'm replying to your comment is because apparently when people do that you read them. it is okay to have opinions, and clearly you do. but you have gone beyond the level of "dissident" to become "asshole" and your opinion has nothing to do with the upgrade. you are most likely savvy enough to understand what a troll is, and despite your, if annoying, well-reasoned comments that is what you have become. it is two years later and you are still involved with this thread. let it go. just let it go. it's too late to redeem yourself, the least you could do is let it go. there is no reason to ever get worked up about anything on the internet unless it is applicable to the non-internet part of reality. this isn't hearts, you get one heart (a lame, in this analogy) and then you go "fuck, i might as well try and shoot the moon." we can all see clearly that this thread has prompted you to, at the very least, reply to everyone who commented on your dissidence and if that reveals anything about your character it is this: you like penny arcade way too much.

      I want to know what other people's favorite webcomics are.  Actually I found your comment funny because I am (obv.) not hip to these things and the only other one I've found is Perry Bible Fellowship, because I'm not into the videogames or fantasy stuff so much.  I do like to read Dykes To Watch Out For online, too, I guess, but that's not really a webcomic.

      for what it's worth, I think the reason for the Superbad connection is not just "penis doodle jokes," but the fact that both focus on some one who has a problem in which that's all they can draw; odd coincidence. <br/>

And as the person who first posted the "did he see superbad?" question, I also wonder why so many people seemed to keep asking the same damn question.  I figured the topic had been covered.

      Ray is sitting at a drawing table. He calls Teodor over to tell him about a problem he is having. Apparently, Ray cannot draw anything without it becoming a penis. Teodor, skeptical of Ray's condition, tells Ray to draw a loaf of sourdough bread. This comes out as a penis. Teodor is concerenedly amazed. Teodor asks Ray to draw a Nintendo Entertainment System. Ray illustrates the request as the male genitalia adorned with pubic hair. Teodor sees through the ruse. He leaves, upset. Ray is delighted with his joke. He continues to draw phalluses until Cornelius or Roast Beef comes in.

      I agree somewhat. I start reading a long conversation (usually a heated argument) for some reason, I guess they are usually interesting? and then after like 4 or 5 scrolls down, I'm just like bla I could be reading another strip. <br/>

Not that I have a problem with discourse at all, go ahead talk amongst yourselves.
