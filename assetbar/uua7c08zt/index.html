      Red Meat will always have a warm place in my sick lil' heart. It's the first webcomic I was ever introduced to. <br/>

That it was introduced to me by a then Boy Scout leader who may or may not have been drunk at the time, has nothing to do with it.

      Every human being I see driving will immediately look away from direct eye contact. If you want to go unacknowledged by humanity, just look all strangers directly in the eye.

      Ok I think I'm guaranteeing some serious lamings by saying this, but I have to be honest - I don't like this strip, or any of the ones that attempt to explain the mechanics of the Achewood universe. It just straight up doesn't make sense. If they have to go to such extremes just to go outside, how do they rent apartments and own houses? The truth is, I don't care how. I care about the characters, the writing and the humor, which are all excellent. I think like any longtime reader, I'm way past worrying about the believability of robots, coke-addicted squirrels and cats hanging out.

      Hmm...but you have to admit that Onstad hasn't exactly kept some rigid, Star Trek-like adherence to these mechanics.  I'm with you, I don't care about continuity and fictional integrity in this sense, but it's always seemed to me like the "Achewood universe" situation is invoked no more often than it is ignored.  If it provokes his creativity on a given day, then you gotta use what you gotta use. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's one thing I like about this comic.  He was inventive enough to come up with this intriguing universe, but smart enough to know that sticking to it at all costs would probably be a hinderance to the humor.

      I like the Underground. It's not essential nor is it mentioned constantly, but it provides a smidgeon of grounding and rationale that hooks into the imagination and, I think, supports the other comics a lot more than you think. Whether that matters or not to you is, of course, your business.

I find the whole Underground concept fascinating, but I'm glad Onstad's kept it in the background.

Also, I am guessing that such a person would be commonplace on either of the coasts, as I hear those places are crazy(?) and full of non-savory characters(?) but I wouldn't know becuase I live in the mid-west(I think?)
