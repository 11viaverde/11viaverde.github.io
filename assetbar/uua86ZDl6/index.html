      Isn't it unclear weather the stable belongs to Cornelius or the stripper? Maybe they just have a lot of common interests.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or maybe it belongs to neither of them, and they are just being youthful and adventurous.

      Speaking of adventure, there is nothing like going to a pancake outlet in the ungodly hours of the morning. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Many times I have gone with friends to IHOP at four AM. <br/> 
When the roads are clear, the pancakes are good, and the only waitress there was a stripper thirty years ago.

      the cabrio is clearly hers; it was parked at her workplace and she was driving it (assuming left-hand drive; cornelius might very well own a right-hand drive car, but i doubt he'd drive a vw) <br/>

cornelius is driving the soapbox car, so i'd assume it's his.

      when did we all decide Cornelius was actually from England?  I always just pictured him an educated American who adopted certain English affectations and mannerisms? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, it isn't impossible that he's supposed to be a Brit, I just don't remember that being said in the comic. <br/>

So I guess this is the post where I realize I'm thinking of Achewood in canon and non-canon terms, and I leave the room quietly sobbing.

      Thank you. I think it also went away back in 2000 or 2001 or so which makes me doubt that some of those newer to webcomics know much about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let us also mention the absolutely amazing and sadly defunct Brunching Shuttlecocks. I somehow found it during the first month or so. One of their columns made me think that the Thirteenth Floor sounded a hell of a lot better and more interesting than some stupid little Keanu Reeves project called the Matrix. I mean, how dumb does  <em>that</em>  sound?

      I am the only one who knows about the Commie Conspiracy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it? A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual, and certainly without any choice. That's the way your hard-core Commie works. I first became aware of it, Mandrake, during the physical act of love...Yes, a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed. Luckily I-I was able to interpret these feelings correctly. Loss of essence. I can assure you it has not recurred, Mandrake. Women, er, women sense my power, and they seek the life essence. I do not avoid women, Mandrake...but I do deny them my essence.

      I am a screen capture of an arbitrarily selected portion of what happened to be up on my other monitor when I finally created this account, which includes both the folder containing the screen capture program and an image file that is a previously taken screen capture.

Also I am from the future and will continue to claim such at  <em>least</em>  until I catch up to the current strips.

      A foggy memory of being in the driver's seat suggests that there is no windscreen: The lines you see as a windscreen are formed by reins that are attached to the axle, and the steering is accomplished by exerting force on either side to pivot the axle on a central attaching bolt. <p> Private stables aside, old school soapbox views the addition of a steering column as an unnecessary element veering towards the vainglorious. The primary direction is down, power is provided by gravity and speed is a function of efficiencies in wind resistance and contact friction. Your estimation of <i>badass</i> in reference to Cornelius remains valid. <p>Age does not suffer weakness gladly.

      And nostrils are just the most interesting thing from this view.  They are smoothly connected to each other, but due to the septum, they aren't quite a simple surface.  I'm picturing the group of paths one can take from the tip of your nose back around to itself.  I can almost grab the homotopy group for a head from this.

 <br/> 
As it is one of the many default avatars, I saw someone with it many moons ago - and instantly recognised it as a Deinonychus due to previous Internets readings about favourite dinosaurs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Are you surprised at my paleo-nerdiness, sir?  Strong men also look up dinosaurs in their spare time.  And if lovin' dinosaurs is wrong, I don't wanna be right.

      Man I don't know if this is any kind of default avatar. Maybe the person you saw many moons ago was, in fact me? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I chose it because I was trying to tell a friend once how awesome and badass deinonychus was and I googled it and the cutest picture of all dinosaur pictures came up. So it became a thing with me.

      Also note that in panel 8 she still has those little marks around her eyes, but they're gone in the last panel.  She just removed her make-up before going to bed.  Cornelius, it seems, was able to see past the freakish surface, but that's to be expected.

      What is it that puns give us that other jokes do not? Humor is mankind's attempt to adjust itself to the irrational, to highlight the absurd and the senseless and make it palatable. We laugh at pain and irony, we giggle when the normal is juxtaposed with the insane, and we chortle when a narrative construct acknowledges that it's false and artificial and has no real authenticity or merit at all.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
We laugh at futility. At the meaningless. Because, otherwise, it'd be painful. It's the comedian's art to make the painful fun.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Puns, in comparison, seem extremely slight. They're coincidences in language, often forced by the joke teller. The humor may derive from trying to swap two unrelated concepts - when a door is ajar, for instance - but usually you laugh not because it works, but because it doesn't. The relation is usually very contrived. So you laugh not because the joke is funny, but because it's not. You laugh at the teller not because he's skilled at swapping these two unrelated objects, but because he isn't. Puns are funny because both the form itself is terrible, and pun tellers get laughs not because they're artful, but because they very clearly aren't.

      We laugh at puns, dear Spinynorman, for the same reasons we hate them.  <br/> 
A pun is a tiny island of order in a sea of lingual chaos; a little triumph.  <br/> 
The greatest comedians of all time use them; Aristophanes, Plautus, P.G. Wodehouse, Oscar Wilde, and even a couple in Brecht and Shaw.  <br/> 
Slight they are, but not. They are slight, but in the same way a gemstone of great price is slight next to a boulder. <br/> 
A teller of puns swaps around the words at hand, and laces in related concepts. This is not art? Why? Art is substituting in elements of your imagination's own creation into a world of set values; if the values are trees, or characters, or words, it is no matter. <br/> 
Anthropologists have found that in every culture, wordplay, especially puns, are met with groans, sighs, and threats of physical violence, mostly because of the joke's construction; still we persevere- we proud chosen. <br/> 
How I love playing  <em>pun</em> dit.

      I would probably go back to say that the art of puns is not measured by how it accomplishes its swap, but how it often spectacularly fails. The value of a pun is its valueless. It's an art form that tries its absolute hardest to be awful. So, to me at least, as far as verbal humor goes, it's the equivalent of the show  <em>Jackass</em> . It  <em>tries</em>  to make you hate it. It, like  <em>Pink Flamingos</em>  makes it its mission to be fundamentally offensive. It's funny merely because you can't believe someone had such an impaired sense of humor that they actually spent time thinking it up. It's certainly not a "laughing with" scenario.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And what schoolkid hasn't spent hours and hours sifting through Shakespeare, trying to find a single pun based on some archaic word or connotation that doesn't even exist anymore? Just because of that, most people can't stand puns. And justly so, I think.

      In that case, the irony of the pun is what's funny about it, and now you're getting into antihumor and that's when heads spin, and I wouldn't call that slight.  It takes a great understanding of the human mind to make a joke that is meant to be humorous and non-humorous and get both responses.  That's part of Shakespeare's legacy; he makes people that actually appreciate his puns laugh with a cringe.  Most of his puns are downright painful.

      Once, on the bus, there were three young men sitting in front of me.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The one on the left, looking out the window, remarked that there was certainly a lot of cedar around the area. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The one in the middle said, "Yes," and then pointed out the window and said, "See dere?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
The one on the right then violently punched the one in the middle in the ear. He fell to the ground whimpering.  <br/>

That is not what I would call both a humorous and a non-humorous reaction. It seems distinctly non-humorous. I do find it hard to say it was an unjust one, however.

      [qoute]Humor is mankind's attempt to adjust itself to the irrational, to highlight the absurd and the senseless and make it palatable. We laugh at pain and irony, we giggle when the normal is juxtaposed with the insane, and we chortle when a narrative construct acknowledges that it's false and artificial and has no real authenticity or merit at all. We laugh at futility. At the meaningless. Because, otherwise, it'd be painful. It's the comedian's art to make the painful fun [/quote] <br/> 
While that's certainly the cynical, ironic side of humor, and reflects well the past few decade of "bash everything sacred" humor, there is certainly another type or types, the gentle humor that children can enjoy, humor that teaches a lesson, or warms the heart.  Be ye not so lost as to never make a baby laugh.  Or unable to come up with an acceptable joke at the dinner table with your parents and other rellies of all ages.

      I actually have more trouble understanding some puns than other jokes. There's like some sort of verbal logic that escapes me.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Example: when eating with my GF's family the subject of a local boy who had been peddling weed came up. They began to argue about how marijuana use did not come with the stigma that it used to anymore, and after several minutes of me saying nothing I quipped, "Well, I think it's certainly more common. After all, I'm high right now." <br/> 
 <br/> 
There was a smattering of chuckles, and then her dad said, "Well, of course you are! You're over six foot aren't you? And your head's always in the clouds!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Brow creased, I nodded, not sure what he meant in the slightest. I stared into my plate for upwards of five minutes, puzzling over his comment, before finally having my epiphany and saying out loud, "Oh, because I'm  <em>tall.</em>  I get it," to which my girlfriend replied that she frequently believed that I was "borderline-retarded."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I understand jokes that have no logic more than those that have a lot.

      It is for that precise reason that I like puns.  A really good 3-level pun concerning, say, German politics or 18th century agrarian business, makes the appreciative listener chuckle and the teller beam with confidence.  Try it at your next regatta gala.

      I find more difficulty understanding visual puns than audible ones. <br/>

And I'm having trouble thinking of a joke I thought was genuinely funny that didn't involve a pun.  Situational humour is all very well but it generally doesn't translate into a joke unless it's a good pun.

      When I was at UC Santa Cruz, an acquaintance of mine working towards her doctorate in Marine Biology told us about a prof she had had while undergradding at UCSD. <br/> 
It seems the fellow was doing research on extending the life of porpoises. He found that by feeding them sea-gulls, the lives of porpoises, no matter how close to being extinguished, could be prolonged... indefinitely. <br/> 
Now, about this time, the lions kept in the world-famous San Diego Zoo staged a daring escape, but I'll get back to that. <br/> 
That same day the lions escaped, the prof had run low on seagull carcasses, and made a run down to the beach to retrieve more. He, in fact, heard about the daring lion escape on the radio as he drove down, but noted the warning against approaching them only discursively. Well, he'd pretty much wiped out the seagull population at most of the local beaches, and so had to travel further afield than usual, but, near the peak of the afternoon, was able to collect enough to feed his sea-cows for the rest of the week. <br/> 
When the good prof returned to his lab, what do you think he found but those very same lions asleep across the threshold of the very door he needed to enter in order to access his lab. <br/> 
He recalled the warning from the radio earlier in the day, but, as he was the adventurous sort, and as his animals had not been fed, which could lead to their death, to the failure of his experiment, and from there to that most feared of academic hells: loss of funding, he decided to risk it. <br/> 
He slowly crept up to the lions, but those lions, they were fast asleep. He quietly unlocked the door, and the lions, they remained asleep. He silently picked up the bag of birds and, just as he was stepping over the kingly cats, the police jumped out of the bushes. <br/> 
"Freeze," they yelled. <br/> 
"What is my crime?" He asked. <br/> 
The cops were silent for awhile until a detective, with a roguish smile, replied: " <em>transporting gulls across staid lions for immortal porpoises</em> !" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Bring on the lames!

      i actually heard this one in variation in a PDQ Bach piece. <br/>

the porpoises were gettin' their bone on like mad and the head lady of said World tells the new guy to get baby seagulls whose flesh acts as an antiaphrodisiac, changing the punchline to 'transporting young gulls' <br/>

but most of all, this joke is much funnier when sang in an opera.

Sorry, nice on water, but you touched a nerve: you tried to connect, if even in a minor way, my favorite band (Pavement) with one of the shittiest songs ever written (Breakfast at Tiffany's).  I don't have an icon with a bald eagle crying in front of the American flag, but I would be completely within my rights to use it if I had one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And both of those songs were mid-90's.

      I don't apologize, because those two songs are inseparable in my mind because growing up I had an older cousin that always played these songs together and for extended periods of time.  I regret nothing.  This is SOMETHING that goes DEEPer than that.  BLUE. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And, yes, I guess '94 and '96 do count as mid-, but I was only 5 and 7 at the time, respectively, so in my IGNORANT, NAIVE,(<-oxford comma) AND IMMATURE mindset, that's my early life and I sometimes connect early life with early nineties.

There's just so much to regret in life.  I try to not let a day go by without regretting something I did.  It's just a little way to remind you that, "hey, you're alive today!  And being alive is a horrible thing to achieve, every second of every god damn day."  This is why people often see me yelling at myself in my car.

      Dear sje46,  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have a feeling that you're joking, but I can't tell for sure.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let me just say this much - though I often feel the need to jab my finger into your ribs when you speak, I don't really have a problem with you. I'm just having a laugh. But in regards to your comment - I really don't know how lame you are or if you're even that lame at all. But regardless of how lame you are or are not, even if it's just a little, tiny bit, I  <em>guarantee</em>  that you are lamer than Pavement.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just trust me on this.

      I was joking.  I am sure that we like a lot of things that are the same.  But I never heard of Pavement.  I'm sorry.  Perhaps as a sign of goodwill you can link me some good songs by them. <br/>

      I am bad at innernet, so I'm not entirely sure how to link you to certain songs (it's hilarious, I know). But as my show of goodwill I will tell you that you may want to start with an album entitled  <em>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain.</em>  It's probably the best thing that happened in the 1990s, musically or otherwise. Only me getting my first blowjob in that same decade had more impact on the world as we know it today. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The album is available on the net webs, of course, as is my first blowjob.

      The things hanging over the stall door are the empty bags.   The helmets were in the bags.   There were two of them -- two helmets.   The helmets were in two bags; two helmets, two bags.   The two empty bags the helmets were held in now remain hanging over stall door #24.   The helmets were held therein; there were two of them.

      On the road from The Cheetah Room, <br/> 
I romanced a dancer with unused womb. <br/> 
The soapbox slot held double sacks, <br/> 
And in the sacks, protective hats. <br/> 
A hat from a sack, and a womb in our room. <br/>

      You forgot the ten page explanation by yours truly, including an essay on the material of the bags and helmets, and a full review of the implications in ancient writings of "two to one" logic, combined with the obvious numerological significance of three and twenty-three. I would end with a <meow>. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The comment would be followed by gibberish by Gladi to the effect that I am basically one fucked up dude. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Aperson would chip in that that was OK, and Hedo would bring up a whole new level of symbology surrounding "bags" and "helmets", and their use in raping unconcious girls in his basement. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not to be left out, fooker would show up to describe the helmet he wore when he had sex in the airport bathroom (seriously, I've seen airport bathrooms - eck!). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Soon, Acheman (Achilleselbow) would show up to deliver some will placed insight into the Cosacks' use of helmets when raping villagers, which would only stir up Hedo into a lather. If we are extreemely lucky, this would be Loneal's cue to point out the raping is likely anti-feminist. etc, etc, etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or, we could just leave that there, and invite la-vie-en-rouge-et-noir to consider that he was one of three people who did not get what the bags were about, and the other two thank him for bringing it up, since now they get it without having to be noticed.

      It doesn't matter. Pretty Woman is possibly one of the worst films ever made. I mean, it not only has She Who Shall Not Be Named, but it also has Richard "Who Even Cares" Gere in it. It's an updated remake of a remake that tries to make something sexier in the most unnecessary and cheap way possible and also fails to deliver on it as well. Aside from being a remake once-removed it's even an amazingly trite story. Finally it's a fluffy romantic comedy designed to be pointless ephemera. Even the costumes are generally bad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is not to be tolerated under any circumstances. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It also seems a bit gauche to discuss something that would parallel their situation like that. I'd think calling attention to her low station in life would be very inappropriate.

      No. Ginger is an aromatic like garlic or onion. If you're using powdered ginger, however, then yeah I'd say it's roughly a spice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Herbs are leaves. Spices are dried roots or berries. Basically there are fresh herbs and dried, but there are never "fresh" spices because they're either dry to begin with or are not used in a fresh from (e.g. juniper berries).

      The mountain will prove to have been derived from a highly stylized rendering of Palin hunting large game, thus innovating the era of subliminal political advertising. It will remain unclear duing the ensuing controversy whether this was intended to strenghen or weaken her position. Years later, in a retrospective, Onstad admits to having planned this tryst between the oldest Achewoodian and a young bimbo has a metaphor for the McCain-Palin bid for the presidency, and the NAACP will complain about the lack of black cats in Acheworld. (Following this, Rod Huggins dies of complications of Aids - he chokes on a sausage - and is replaced by a shady black cat who is pushing gay marriage in the strip three times a year.) <br/>

      I see Fooker getting head in an airport, and then crying himself to sleep every night thereafter, knowing that his past glory will never return, and that the cruel hands of Time are clawing at his back--wherein there used to be the soft hands of a woman. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe he'll settle down someday, he thinks.  His rogueish airport-getting-head ways put away for the right lady...You can't teach an old dog new tricks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He realizes the only soul-connection he ever felt was with that airport-skeez, so he begins to passive-aggressively attempt to win her back.  A few anonymous emails to her new boyfriend, a few comments left on a website they mutually enjoyed.  The modern equivalent of breaking into her new home and scattering photographs of them together all over the floor. <br/>

He can fuck her, sure.  But he'll never have her back. <br/>

      This is indeed correct. When I would make the sexy with a lady in college (that is, a particular lady) the twin bed was woefully inadequate and she would return to her own bed for sleep. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unless you are incredibly tired and able to fall asleep easily spooning does not work. Even the slightest movement is enough to keep you from falling asleep or wake you up in the early stages.

      She gets tired easily. I do not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ideally everything I would desire to do together has already been done. The only reason I can see sleeping without having accomplished everything is if, perhaps, it requires additional people, equipment, costumes, or she's simply very sore. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The last time I saw my girlfriend sleeping it was not cute. I couldn't stop thinking about her being dead. It just creeped me out and sent me into a fairly typical existential panic.

      I used a twin too. The real issue was not its size but that it had the pliability and ergonomic integrity of a bag of used forks, and made sounds like Optimus Prime beating off when any properly vigorous whoopee was made. Seriously, your average Dickens character had better sleeping arrangements than I did.

Grapes of Wrath was, like all of Steinbeck, a new level of terrible. It was perhaps one of the worst books I've read that wasn't Ethan Frome or A Separate Peace.

      Well, we do call 'em universities in general, but the point here is that there are certain contexts where Brits (and others?) say "university" while we Americans must say "college" -- just one of the minor differences between divergent Englishes. <br/>

      A university is made up of colleges.  But some colleges are small and independent and aren't part of a university.  Even if you go to a university, you are actually in a college, most likely, as you become specilaized in a major.  So "college" is the most applicable term for higher education.

      Indeed. Where I graduated from we had a "College of Arts and Sciences" which was basically what it says on the tin and a mix of hard sciences and the other sorts of things you'd expect from liberal arts. There were also, however, College of Engineering, College of Business, College of Agriculture, College of Architecture and Design, and even the College of Human Ecology. Within each college would be a department of say Biology or Electrical Engineering or such. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In some schools this is rather key as, for example, Cornell is not a completely Ivy League university. Only the College of Arts and Sciences (or whatever it's called, I forget the precise college name) is part of the Ivy League. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is, I believe why it's a university in that it combines multiple colleges. Usually the only ones calling themselves a college are comprised only of one college and tend to be liberal arts schools more often than not.

      Here in Canada a college and a university denote two different kinds of school - a university is a place where you go into debt to get regular degrees (and are forced to read The Scarlet Letter).  A college is a place where you go into debt learning to weld, cut hair, cook or in my case, become a golf professional.  Something trades related.

      My girlfriend read it when she was 15 or so (the correct age), but never liked it either. I still regard this as a significant flaw. It may well be a female/male issue. <br/>

      Women in general are raised to be more "empathetic", more group-oriented, while young boys are raised to be independent and free-spirited. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe women have a harder time relating to Catcher in The Rye because we traditionally are ingratiated into the "outside world" quicker, while men go through more periods of disillusionment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, that isn't everyone.  But I can tell you that most girls I'm friends with didn't much care for Catcher in the Rye, and they're just as intelligent as any dude I know who loved the book. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe it's just like Monty Python that way.

      I am not a book man, but  <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>  was one I could tolerate. <br/> 
I was the kind of guy that read Sparknotes throughout high school. It just always felt that I could be doing  <em>more</em>  with my time than just reading. It's kind of my thing to avoid simply wasting time - it bothers me more than I can accurately describe to find out an even an hour's work was all for nothing. It's just hard to justify time spent reading, possibly because I'm not the fastest reader, when I can be experiencing so much more stimulus. <br/> 
I'd like to enjoy books, though. Here's to hope.

      Sparknotes? What is that? Something like Cliff's Notes? <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only time I've ever read a study guide to anything was with The Divine Comedy and that's mainly because otherwise I wouldn't possibly be able to understand references to medieval popes and political figures. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I found it crazy when I saw people reading Cliff's Notes for Animal Farm to avoid reading it (I'd already read it about a dozen or so times by that point, but I read it again because it would only take me an hour or two... then I read it again) or getting the book on tape for Slaughterhouse Five. Crazy. <br/>

      Pathetic indeed.  That word has developed a negative connotation, but the way in which he chooses to view the world in indeed sympathy inducing.  He is afraid of the prospect of growing up, and losing his innocence.  That is why he acts the ways he does.

PRECISELY. I was 19 or 20 when I read it. The entire time I was wondering why the hell I should care about that stupid twat or any of his dumbass decisions. When I finally finished it I had a strong urge to destroy the book by means of tearing or perhaps fire but it wasn't my copy so I had to settle for just throwing it across the room, my small revenge on it for having wasted my time.

      Sad? That seems a bit odd to me. I mean, I guess I can see where you're coming from, but that's not how I felt about it at all. <br/>

I always saw it in much more of an existential light. Then again some people tend to find existentialism pretty sad and depressing. I just can't relate to that.

Of course. I have a hard time believing that anyone couldn't at least appreciate that book. I'm not even the kind of person who is dumbstruck whenever someone says they don't like something that I think is great. It's just perfect is all.  <br/>

      My feelings on Gatsby are weakly positive.  It doesn't stand out, but it wasn't particularly bad in a way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have found that I went at literature the wrong way though - I started with modern stuff, made all kinds of connections myself, and now those pioneering works that invented these methods seem horribly slow paced since they're explaining every little detail as they go.

I don't think there's any such thing as reading the wrong books in time first. Literature generally gets "better" as you progress forward in time, which simply means that as the way people think and talk evolves with the times, the ways a narrator can communicate with us can expand, and methods that worked before don't work as well as they used to. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm still occasionally thrilled when I'm reading a work from another era and I notice a turn of phrase or colloquialism that seems unexpectedly modern.

      You know, they say that when you dream your falling, if you hit bottom you'll for-real die.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have often dreamt I was falling, and I have dreamt that I hit the ground and died. I have dreamt rolling a car off a cliff at 130 k.p.h. and kicking it. I have dreamt being shot in the chest and in the head at short range. I didn't survive, and the preemptive burial in the the landfill was most ingracious. I've been beheaded with a shovel, impacted by a freight train, involved in an airplane reconnecting with the earth in abrupt and fiery fashion. I have morned the loss of my own life, as well as that of members of my family. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have often pondered if this quirk of dreaming my own death having nil effect on my actual status as a living thing is indicative of a more general (if unappreciated) rule, or if I'm just an odd fellow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have finally come to terms with it: I'm just not smart enough to realize I should be dead!

      It's one of those places that was formerly an IHOP but is now something much better, but still looks like an IHOP.  There's an excellent Korean restaurant near me that is quite obviously a former Pizza Hut; the experience of having such good food while sitting in a Pizza Hut only adds to the experience.

      Listen.  Anything can be abused.  It is not good to eat an entire thing of Coricidan Cough and Cold.  It is also not good to send out those applications.  It does not mean that cough medicine is bad.  Just the people who send you 20 application requests a day.  Those are the people you have to block. <br/>

      I agree this is an awesome revelation (that the dude owns property). I'm thinking a hunting lodge with a bearskin rug and many exotic possessions garnered during his travels is located somewhere on this mountain estate.

      Between the silhouette in Panel 9 and the time stamp in Panel 10, I'm assuming that there's a decent time lapse between the two.  I believe, after a death-defying ride down the mountain, they pulled to a stop in a pasture and Cornelius pulled an old blanket from the back of the racer.  Then they made love for hours under the full moon in the night air.  Only as the sun came up did they decide it was time for a restorative breakfast and then bed.  I mean, after a romantic ride like that, the mood was definitely right for one thing and it was not ham steaks.

      like most of you i have a big penis so when i *poop* it dips into the bowl, what i do is place it on top of my thigh while i *bathroom* but like you as well i pee as i *defecate* and since it's out of the bowl i employ the use of a McDonald's coke cup. <br/> 
 <br/> 
question: what do you use to keep your peen out of the bowl while YOU *use the toilet*? <br/>

      Well, I don't really wear shirts with things on them, so a signed strip might be the way to go. As for which one, I could immediately narrow it down to about three strips, but from there it would get really too difficult. Maybe just the cookbook would be the way to go.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, if it helps my karma any, I introduced someone to Achewood a little while back who went on to buy almost every single thing that is sold here. So there's that.
