      Go to Gunnerkrig Court. Read some of the comments on any given strip. <br/> 
Gouge out your eyes and come running to the bastion of worldly intellectualism that is Acheworld. <br/> 
It's a moronic wankfest as opposed to the fascinating and valuable wankfest here, and I've seen the same thing on other comics that enable comments. <br/> 
Gunnerkrig Court is a superb bit of work, so it isn't just the quality of the comic reflecting in the comments. <br/> 
I'd guess it's the intellectual flair of Achewood (I feel kind of silly but kind of awesome saying this when the specific strip I'm commenting under portrays a cat having water poured into a cup on a cantilever attached to his groin, while an alive stuffed bear watches in bewilderment.

      I think the energy went out of everyone by then, having raced back through the archives for the first year, catching up to the present day, that took a lot of energy.  Many of the early posters seem to have vanished.  Are you looking at the new strips as they are posted?

      Wait, so you've stopped reading the current strips because of the inordinate amount of comments unrelated to the strip, and you are working your way through the archives, making several comments that are unrelated to the strip? <br/>

      <em><strong>Full Disclosure:</strong></em> <br/> 
I am one of the folks known to contribute many non-strip-related comments in the current day, and I am wending my way through the archives once more, to read the old comments and make contributions. <br/> 
Though in the current strips I often scroll past vast wastelands of posts I have no interest in, there are many many nuggets of pure gold to be mined in nearly every strip's posts.  I encourage you to mine them.

      Apparently at least one other person has seen this and deemed it grossly unnecessary. Besides the utter grossness of what you refer to, historicity demands that we consider this comic in the time that it was written, a better time when such things didn't exist on the planet.
