      Speaking as a gay person, I've learned that uses of that term term can be quite gentle, if applied VERY carefully within a considerate context. <br/>

The term "faggots," on the other hand, is right on the fucking edge.  I see that now.

      I didn't really notice; i just assumed he was using it from the inside, as it were. Better to stick to queers and maybe fags if you want to assimilate terms. Faggot is still 24 carat nasty-ass in my book.
