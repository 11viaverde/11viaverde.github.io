      Do you mean, how did we come to this? Every time the wonders of science bring us new technology - television, sending moving images straight into our homes from anywhere in the world; the internet, connecting people all over the globe, enabling us to have a conversation with a group of people from all different countries, linking us to them in seconds; interactivity, where we, the receivers of content, can have direct control over what we see and what the powers that be send for us to watch - the second all these things appear, before their incredible potential as something beautiful can be fully realised, they get snapped up by "creatives" who boil their possibilities down to the lowest common denominator, appealing to the widest ranging masses but never really pleasing anyone, leaving us all with this hollow, empty disenchantment with the world we live in, despite all the advances we've made?  <em>Oh Crap! How did this happen!</em> <br/> 
 <br/>

      Troy_convers was happy to have achieved 'first post', an emotion I can hardly condone. You, however, are upset to have have been beaten to the achievement, which is even worse. Put simply, not only do you value ridiculous trivialities, but you are unable to obtain them. You are a drunk lunatic, gazing longingly though a shop window at an almost empty bottle of window cleaning fluid which one of the staff has accidentally left amid the displayed goods (the shop window represents life).

      The person most deserving of the cleaning fluid is catachresis who regularly gets FRIST PSOT (first post) as well as the not-so-coveted 2nd post. Sure Asherdan's first posts got lamed a  <em>lot</em>  but catachresis made an art of doubling-up, here's a few I dug up in mere seconds: [https://tinyurl.com/1catachresis]this one[/url] and another [https://tinyurl.com/2catachresis]here[/url] and one more [https://tinyurl.com/3catachresis]for you[/url].

      Hey let's clear up this 'First Post' cobblers once and for all. <br/> 
Someone has to post first, otherwise we'd have 1600  blank comment pages. Unfortunately, the First Post spot has been tarnished by all of the muppets over the course of time turning it into some bizarre badge of honour. Lame me all you want, I don't give a rodents rump, I did a first post wowee let's all throw turnips at Convers. Are you telling me that once a new strip is uploaded you all sit around waiting for some else to make the first move? That%u2019s just so, so, fucking sad on so many levels. <br/> 
And there was I thinking Assetbar wasn't full of people absorbed in their own self-image. <br/>

      It's more quality than position.  There exist good first posts - but they are rare and cherished with chubbies.  Because usually some guy sees the blank page and can't resist urinating upon it.

      They had a choice, all of them.  They could have followed in the footsteps of good men like my father, or President Truman.  Decent men, who believed in a day's work for a day's pay.  Instead the followed the droppings of lechers and televangelists and didn't realize that the trail led over a precipice until it was too late.  Don't tell me they didn't have a choice.

I'm assuming that sandman is a throwaway account that you just created for testing purposes.

      Here is an unintersting story: <br/> 
 <br/> 
The day that Tiger's indiscretions were first made public, I said to that boy I live with:  <br/> 
"Hey, did you hear that Tiger Woods is having, like, nine affairs?" <br/> 
to which he replied: <br/> 
"Nine!?" <br/> 
to which I giggled and said: <br/> 
"Well, not nine. But you know, a few." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then, what does Tiger decide to do but go ahead and make that hilarious overexaggeration of mine seem like a pittance. Thanks Tiger, thanks a  <em>lot.</em>

      I'm pretty sure I'm on Ray's side here, though.  At worst this is a sign Americans eat too much food and the media has no taste.  Hardly worse than bear-baitin' and stonin' women.  I have this conversation with my friend a lot who, whenever I say something sucks, responds monotonously "Yeah but also everything ever sucks forever though."  A lot like Beef, actually.

      so shit <br/> 
 <br/> 
I go to use my roommate's new vacuum cleaner and it's not working.  It's some new bagless model, and it's made completely out of clear plastic.  So I can look inside of it and I can see that it has three containers which contain the dirt and cat hair, and they are all completely clogged. <br/> 
 <br/> 
how fucking stupid do you have to be to not be able to figure out when you vacuum is blocked with dirt, especially when it's made entirely of clear plastic? <br/>

      I wonder about that sometimes, if I was rich, would I buy an expensive vacuum cleaner or sport scar?  I am not rick so I don't buy these things.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean... six or more hundo.. seems like a poor application of it to spend on a spesive vacuum cleaner  <em>(fuck you assetbar you not gettin no plus sign tonight) (normall I would type plus sign but here I type "or more") </em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
right, I mean, money, is just value that was created by people working different jobs, the school teacher, the factory worker, the garbage man, and somehow, some of that value winds up in my pocket book <br/> 
 <br/> 
and if I am uber rich, to spend that value on luxiry doesn't seem right, because all them people psychologically trapped in those shitty jobs, to use the fruits of their efforts for my luxiries, doesn't seem right, you know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would think better application of my six hundo would be to purchase a high powered rifle with a scope and to shoot the president.  although I think you might need several thousand for such an ideal rifle or something, or maybe a better way would be with a radio controlled model airplane loaded with explosives and a camera on it so you can be sitting many miles away sipping on a cola and you just radio control that fucker from 1000 feet down onto the stage where the president is giving a speech and before anyone can say anything or do anything BAM dead president.  Altough it would work better if the president is replublican like Bush or Reagan I am not so much sure kiling obama would be a good idea.  maybe kill a republican senator instead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know if they have special radar they use when the preseident is in the area to check for crazy ass radio control model planes they should have that because you know it would be easy <br/> 
 <br/> 
reminds me of another idea I have for robbing banks is you have radio control robot that you drives into the bank through the doors and it has guns on it and it is like "give me all your money mother fuckers" (it has speaker on it too)  (with distorted sound so they can't recognize your voice) <br/> 
 <br/> 
and then the robot drives out of the bank and it has like a model airplane that launches off of it with the money, and the robot maybe it drives away and it hides somewhere until the coast is clear you can drive it back to the hideout later on but even if the robot gets caught it's no big deal because it's like ha ha I can build another robot you fuckers.  and the robot it has self destruct dynamites built in so it can blows it's self up if they are about to catch it it has big voice that says "okay fuckers you caguht me now but you best step back because I'm about to blow this up"  robot would have no mercy I tell you no mercy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
any fucker who robs a bank for a living just isn't putting any effort into it if they have not made themselves a robot helper I'm telling you.

      So...  Brittany Murphy died at age 32.  Some hollywood actress.  I really have no idea who she is.  [IMGS OFF] <br/> 
 <br/> 
anyway.  maybe she was found naked hanging from a tie in the closet with rubber bands around her clit and boobies.  That would be cool if she died from auto-erotic asphixiation (sp?) because she was a sex freak.  I mean, it wouldn't be cool that she died, but since she did die, I might as well be entertained by it anyway. <br/>

      do they have any blow up dolls of dead people?  Not just Elvis or Michael Jackson but like, regular dead people.  Maybe with different versions so you can choose how long they been dead for?  24 hours / 72 hours / one week sort of thing.  Of course, it would have to be like, how many hours after they buried them, right.  Like Jackson, I think they kept him in a fridge for several weeks after he died, didn't they?  By the time he got in the ground the worms probably were like 'damn, this one is stale already.'

      it would be cool if they had a blow up doll of conjoined twins.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
man, if there was conjoined twin sex workers, that would be awesome.  sex with prostitutes is awesome because it's a dirty naughty thing to do, so that really gets my rocks off.  then on top of that if it was sex with conjoined prostitutes, man, that would be like combing sex with lesbian twins along with sex with circus freaks AND sex with prostitutes ALL into one session.  That would be so awesome.  I bet they could charge OVER SIX HUNDO for a mere 20 minutes of that shit.  I couldn't afford it but maybe some day.  Glad, you can keep your fucking Dyson, the memories of sex with conjoined prostitute incestuious lesbian sisters would still be lingering long after your Dyson warranty has expired and it's all clogged up and smoked out with flea infested pet hair and used tampons.  They could even be faking the part about being lesbians it wouldn't matter I wouldn't notice my mind would be so blown by it all nothing would bring be down or make me go soft.  The only thing better would be is if we also had cocaine.

      oh man but that would suck if it was one of those setups the cops do.  You all ready to get your bone on with the lesbian conjoined twin sisters and then the cops bust down the door and they're like 'freeze' and they cuff you and it turns out the twin sisters is under cover cops, and they wasn't even really conjoined at all they was just regular twins and they was using duct tape under their specially knitted dual-noggin chullo.  oh that would suck so close to your dream to have it snatched away from you by some knuckle head cops chasing after some pipe dream of solving society's social ills when all they are doing is creating more victims instead of solving the real underlying root causes of poverty and education and lack of opportunity, in essence a cycle of repression, making the faux-conjoined twin cops merely an instrument of repression and perpetuation of el sistema.  fuckin' eh.  whymI having such negative thoughts lately it don't make no sense I need to be more positive I need to affirm to myself that when I find my conjoined twin lesbian prostitutes that they will be for real not undercover cops and they will even be fore real lesbians not just faking it.  god bless us every one.
