      My friend in high school had a purebred poodle who was maybe the most retarded and frightening dog on the planet. It was a full size poodle and its puff of poodle hair hid the enormous bone crest deformity it had on the top of its skull. It always followed his mom around like she was made of solid heroin and it tended to forget you were in the room if it didn't look right at you ever four seconds, which resulted in a lot of furious, intimidating barking if you were in the same room with it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One time I was at his house when his dad came back with it from a walk. They were all about go somewhere so I was out the door and his mom was like, "Shadow, say bye to Norman! Say bye!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Shadow just had this rather sickened look on its face and did nothing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Oh, Shadow, why don't you want to say bye to Norman?" asked his mom. "Why don't you want to say bye?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
And it was then that the poodle decided to look at me with its tiny button eyes and open its mouth and unleash the three turds of dogshit it had kept hidden in its mouth  <em>for the past two blocks as well as the river of drool it had accumulated since, all over the  marble floor.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will never remember hearing his dad, a quaint Midwestern man, crying, " <strong>HOLY SHIT!</strong> " at the top of his lungs as all that dogshit surfed across the floor towards the toes of everyone's shoes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Good times. Good times. I'll stick with weiner dogs, thanks.

      Odd.  I only just realised it was Spiny Norman, not Spinynor Man.  This is despite having no idea of what a "Spinynor" might be and thus only the vaguest sense of SpinynorMan's wonderful abilities.  Apparently I needed to encounter Jesus as a caped bipedal dog before I could move on.  I'm not sure if the accompanying chord was E#m but it was definitely played on a Casiotone sampling a herd of flatulent sheep.

      We once had a dog that thought my mom was made of pure heroin. She couldn't go to the bathroom without him pawing at the door and howling. He learned how to open doors to get to her, and not just the doors that swung inward and were easily pushed open. This was a goddamn Jurassic Park raptor dog. The creepiest thing I've ever seen was this dog carefully balancing on his hind legs and taking tiny step backwards in order to open my parents' bedroom door toward himself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I haven't ever seen a dog shoot shit out of its mouth, so perhaps I don't have any license to talk about creepy dogs...though I have watched in fascinated horror as a dog ate its own shit  <em>while</em>  it was shitting, like some kind of foul ouroboros.

      When I was but a young lad, I had the misfortune to fart in front of my girlfriend's mother after having dinner with her family for the first time. And it wasn't one of those quiet ones you can pass off on the chair creaking or anything, it was a terrible, nasty sound that emanated from my buttocks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Needless to say, I was mortified. But her mother just looks at me with these terrible, accusing eyes and says "How DARE you pass wind before me!?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I went beet-red and apologised. "Damned right you're sorry!" she says. There`s a pregnant silence. "It was MY turn!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
Turns out fucking with her daughter's boyfriends was a hobby of hers.

      The astute observer will also notice that the dog, virtually immediately after regurgitating, begins licking the ochre-colored mess it made with barely concealed curiosity in a typical canine twist on the old adage, "what goes in must come out". <br/>

It's probably my favourite thing about that GIF, as far as having  <em>any</em>  favourite thing about a GIF of two dogs humping followed by one of the dogs vomiting profusely is reasonable and justified (as opposed to indicating a questionable state of mind).

      When I was a kid, my dogs ate my sister's and my Halloween candy every single year. They also ate their own shit, and one of them would eat socks that dropped from laundry baskets, so she could hear how strange her own barking sounded when she had a sock caught in her throat (usually we did not have to take her to the vet as she slowly asphyxiated, but not always). One time, they split a bag of rat poison. We were not that worried about the chocolate Halloween candy, all things considered.

      well even Emeril has a blog. Her blog is the most forward representation of her as her voice is most clear in it, (how does he write women so well??) whereas I feel for the main characters (Beef, Ray, Philippe) it is a place for highly specialized ramblings, and not a place you go to get to know a character, such as Molly's.  <br/>

I am down with her though she is a solid lady.

      For a man to write a woman, especially with comedic purposes in mind, is a challenge. I have had this conversation with fellow comedians and we all tend to let female characters become the sort of 'straight woman' and have difficulties giving them quirks or things that make them endearing in their own right. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was talking with a friend who does a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145252/https://piecomic.com/">comic</a>  and he thinks it is a side effect of our new post-feminist society. Particularly for our generation, we grew up watching sitcoms like  <em>Home Improvement</em>  where the wife was the mirror who showed Tim Allen that he is a clown. It can be difficult to allow yourself to give a female character comedic flaws because then they just feel ditzy. If there was a female character with Ray's spendthrift nature (this is not to say that you can create a funny female character just by tossing the traits of funny male characters at them but just an example or an idea) I doubt many would appreciate her.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I do not think saying "well  <em>Achewood</em>  is for a predominantly male audience" lets Onstad 'off the hook' as it were. There's no reason for Molly not to be a stronger, more well-rounded character. I'd say that if Onstad gives Teodor an arc (he has been getting some fun little attention lately) he should go to Molly next. <br/>

      No, no, a thousand times no. There is no reason for Molly to get an arc, precisely BECAUSE she is a 'straight woman' character and is only funny in her interactions with Beef. People mistake likable for funny. Sure, we can all agree she's a nice, sensible, caring girl, perhaps the kind we would like to meet in real life, but this doesn't mean that a comic about her would be funny. It is too late at this point to change her character as drastically as would be required in order for her to be funny on her own.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Secondly, as you yourself seem to suggest, the brutal, dark, cynical humor that is characteristic of Achewood would not work well targeted at female characters. Would you feel comfortable having a female character with Todd's drug addiction or Lyle's forays into porn? I think it goes without saying that the vast majority of readers wouldn't, though why this is the case and what it says about society is an interesting discussion for another time and place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I'm generally against trying to apply affirmative action to webcomics. Achewood works fine just the way it is, and it works for a reason. If you want more woman-centered comics, go read Questionable Content (shitty indie soap opera in my opinion) or Octopus Pie (decent, but not really that funny, probably because for the same reason I said above, which is that nothing overly ridiculous or gross happens to the female characters). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, I realize I just said a bunch and I could've elaborated on plenty of these points, but I'm sure no one wants me to write a term paper on here.

      I don't think anyone's disagreeing with you, I pretty much feel the same way. It's just interesting that she's been given a flow chart, as it's the first that has been completely interactive of the other characters and not solely on the character itself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just raises some interesting points, which, apparently , if you talk about them correctly, will get you laid at a bar.

      Best perhaps to accept that these Achewoodians are well-written characters regardless of gender, and it is this writing that makes them seem real that makes them funny, not how funny you personally have problems finding women. Individual women can of course be funny (and Roast Beef and company are not always funny because of gross and ridiculous situations, there are words and attitudes and observations too); if a character is being written as a "woman" rather than as an individual, the failing in characterisation and perhaps humour is there. I don't like the idea that one would think a comic's shitty because it has women in it rather than because it's just shit. We're better than this, people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(A good test for the Britishers out there- try out opinions on women and comedy by saying them out loud in Bernard Manning's voice, see how you feel).

      I'm pretty much in agreement with everything you said, and I wasn't implying that some comics aren't funny because they're woman-centered - I think it's more correlation than causation. But the question of why there aren't more women characters has been brought up, and I was just offering some general ideas about why this is the case, not necessarily saying that this is a good thing. Is it possible to consistently write funny women-centered humor that avoids demeaning media cliches on the one hand and being uncomfortably offensive on the other? Probably. Is it done often? No. I think my example about Todd and Lyle still stands, as well as my point that Molly was written mainly as a support character and we shouldn't demand that she be thrust into a bigger role simply BECAUSE she is a woman. Hope that clears things up.

      I agreed with you up until you said "If you want more women-centered comics, go read etc etc" and then proceeded to slam the options given.  If my only choices are either male-centered comics or shitty comics, then odds are, I am going to hope that the good comics are more inclusive of similarly gendered people to me.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I'm not saying that Onstad needs to do that.  I love Achewood and wouldn't really change it.  I just think it's sad that the options are so limited and sadder still that I might be the only person who is in fact saddened by this.

      There are times when it is perfectly acceptable, in fact expected, to write an F as E#, for example as the leading tone in the key of F#.  Along the same lines, if a composer were writing a piece in C# major, the minor chord built off the third scale degree would be called E# minor, not F minor.  Of course, he could also just write the dang thing in D-flat major and call it a day. <br/>

      Urrtra Nerd comment alert: It could make sense in certain contexts. Notations like E#, B#, G## are used when it's necessary to preserve the intervallic identity of the note in the given key. For instance, the 7th scale degree of F#major is correctly written as E# rather than F to avoid confusion with the fundamental. Since there's no such thing as a diminished octave in classical notation, the note is referred to as E#, just as E is the 7th scale degree in the key of F major. So one could have an E# minor chord in the context of the ii chord in the key of D# (melodic) minor, for instance. Incidentally, while you're correct to point out that E#m and Fm are enharmonically equivalent, they are only identical pitches in equal temperament; a just-intoned tuning system produces not a cicle of fifths, but rather a  <em>spiral</em>  where E# and F are  <em>two distinct pitches</em> . I'm a virgin, by the way.

      Honestly, I didn't know that music theory knowledge fell under the category of nerd-dom. <br/>

I thought it was for people who could rock a DISGUSTING piano and make chicks swoon etc.  <br/>

      A lot of your more DISGUSTING piano (guitar, bass, etc.) rockers with the swooning chicks are not so up on the Theory.  If you or fuckyoufriday have both, then more power to you.  I'm still pretty much working on the 3 chords end of the spectrum.

      No, not at all, not at all. My cousin is probably a  <em>technically</em>  better pianist than Ben Folds, but likely far less talented overall. And anyway, my cousin is a classical musician. <br/>

But the point was that he knows music theory inside and out and is a fantastic pianist but could probably not make a chick swoon to save his life.

      Don't get too excited. I didn't have anything in mind. It's just that when I read Ohmygooses comment, I thought to myself,  <em>"Oooh,</em>  I'm  <em>definitely</em>  going to say horribly crass here!" I decided to thumb through the book to find a way to twist some sad passage into a pertinent and evil joke. Then the book got the best of my milquetoast ass (like it always has) and my cruelty was eclipsed by the Saddest Sadness.

      "Dammit woman" sounds like classic Monty Python. I used to think it was just a silly act, but when I was in Europe last summer I saw a middle-aged British couple in the restaurant district of Nice that talked exactly like the typical male/female Monty Python characters. The man had a potbelly, shaved head, and a fanny pack, while the woman had a shrewish face and a ridiculous wide-brimmed hat. Their conversation went something like this: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Woman (in high-pitched, screechy voice): I just dawn't loike their main cauwses! <br/> 
Man (in slurred lager-lout voice): Dammit woman, why dawn't you loike the main cauwses?! <br/> 
Woman: I just dawn't LOIKE 'em, is all! <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was too perfect. You had to be there.

      Well if you guys are going to let BBC sitcoms determine how we think you talk, perhaps you should put people with better enunciation on teevee.  I assume everyone from Britain talks like characters from Red Dwarf or the announcers on the BBC news.  Is this wrong?  Or should I be thinking of Fawlty Towers?

      Once you're in high school, at least, my high school, the band is actually full  of chill people, and become a sort of insular family that somehow gets more tang than the rest of the school combined. My friend was in the band, and I envied him. He eventually became the drum major, and it went to his head. It was weird, because he played clarinet. But apparently the drum major does not actually play drums? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyhow, in middle school, being in the band is associated with large orthodontic appliances. <br/>

      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145252/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_%281940s_subculture%29">Actually</a> , the original hipsters were the precursors to the beatniks. Today, hipsters wish they could go back to that time, like you say. They are hella annoying to deal with especially if you are a blackman like me. I met this one attractive but very immature young lady whose favorite novel was  <em>On The Road</em>  and basically only liked me for my dreads and would say things like "God I wish it were the 60s" to which I would simply reply "I sure as hell don't." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I love the Norman Mailer quote about hipsters, which to him are individuals "individuals, %u201Cwith a middle-class background (who) attempt to put down their whiteness and adopt what they believe is the carefree, spontaneous, cool lifestyle of Negro hipsters: their manner of speaking and language, their use of milder narcotics, their appreciation of jazz and the blues, and their  <em>supposed</em>  concern with the good orgasm.%u201D [5] <br/>

I'm still going with springer spaniel.  My favorite uncle had one.  It was constantly bringing people presents, and it had a miraculous power of healing - he lasted 3 years after a stroke because of that dog.  After she was killed chasing trucks down a major street, my uncle died a couple of months later.  Just like Jesus.

      It makes me feel crummy that i enjoy the trailer trash side parted Beef just a tad more than i enjoy the regular Beef.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Does this make me a bad person? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Does asking that make me a neurotic person? <br/>

Do puppies have Christmas? <br/>

      Jesus would be a chipper looking beagle: all friendly as hell to even child molesters. One day he gets too friendly with a BMW, everyone crying over his dead little body, all perfectly preserved. Three days later he comes back and takes his favorite squeaky hamburger up to heaven.

      Our wonderful, gentle black lab died of kidney failure when I was seven and he was two. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The purebred yellow labrador retriever we got afterwards was a dud pet in every sense of the word. We had to step over a baby gate in the front hallway for his entire ten-year lifespan, because without it, he'd dash out the front door as soon as some hapless visitor opened it, and would run around the neighbourhood eating goose shit and whatever other disgusting garbage he'd find to satiate his dog-pica. He was absolutely non-affectionate and would obsessively-compulsively lick every square inch of the kitchen floor (and the countertops when you weren't in the room). He could not fetch.  <em> The Retriever could not fetch. </em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
That dog made me no longer a dog person.
