      I've seen probably two half episodes of  <em>Sliders</em> , but I know what you're talking about. Those star things are marks of power or something, and one of the guys with the mark tries to mack on the chick and she turns him down and he says "don't you know what I could do with this?" and shows her the hand and she says "yeah, I used to draw on myself as a kid, too" or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can't believe I remember watching ten minutes of sliders like twelve years ago. I never saw the end, what happened in the rest of that episode?

      I'm replying to kb here so it stays near his post, and I gotta say I feel like maybe you're lying about not remembering their names.  One of the ones you used comes from the current generation of the games (Yes i played it, no i didn't catch 'em all).  Also, you've misspelled the word "pokemon" all but one time, leading me to believe that you know perfectly well how to spell it, and are pretending not to.  This is the worst way to pretend to be cool.

      honestly, all i know are pidgey and spearow. i miss the good old days of blue and red when times were simpler and i only needed to memorize 150 pokemon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
as for spelling it "pokeman" instead of "pokemon", i just messed that up, i threw that pic together pretty quick. i am not pretending to be cool by misspelling "pokemon" to a bunch of strangers on the internet...

      i won't lie, i caught all 150 pokemon back in the days of pokemon red and blue (i had red and i played it on a 1st generation gameboy). <br/>

My friend and I were pretty big on that game, but that was, as someone said above, 7 or more years ago. <br/>

      As to chicken or what: <br/> 
I've been struggling all day to recall what it is that panel 6 reminds me of.  There's some nightmarish cartoon bird-thing image in my memory, way back there.    It's like the Looney Tunes  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144513/https://toolooney.goldenagecartoons.com/dodopointing.gif">dodo bird</a> , or something, but there's something else I can't remember, exactly.  A different thing it reminds me of (and which is probably copied from that same, older source) is the scary head that Alec Baldwin's character makes in Beetlejuice; you know, when he stretches the back of his head to a point with his hand and plucks his own eyes out. <br/>

      Well, a "cad" seems to imply that I dangerously steer my struggle buggy around the bend whilst topped up to the brim with GnT's with a stolen policeman's helmet riding beside me.  <br/>

A caution, now... Not too sure of what that could mean. Regardless, I'll assume it's a compliment, not to mention a cool-sounding thing to say that I will probably steal in the near future.

      That i]Fuckin'[/i] image is extremely special to me. The lovely thing about it is that it's just there in the abckground, Beef doesn't refer to it or acknowledge it in any way. Weirder yet is that Pat is presumably the one who put it there. We're left to wonder why Pat would own something so arguably crass, and what purpose he thought it would serve in his spacecraft. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I once found myself bored in a biology class and drew up a larger, somewhat more detailed i]Fuckin'[/i] panel in my notebook. Thing took up the bottom half of the page. One day I thoughtlessly leant my notes to a classmate, not thinking to warn her of my dirty doodling habit. When the notebook was returned to me, the bottom half of my page on the lymphatic system was missing. I knew what was there. She didn't tell me what became of it, and I was too embarassed to ask her myself.

      "Racial impurity" as an expression or phrase only means there exists a mixture of racial sources. It says and means  <em>nothing</em>  about the moral standing of the individual. Why must we connote such? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Promiscous means "indiscriminate", and yet when we use it, everyone hears the word "sexually" in front of it, whether we meant it that way or not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, we can not fault the language. It does its best to serve us while we shackle it with so much extra meaning and significance. Let's not be so hypersensitive. <br/>

Go back far enough, and we're all impure racially. I've got geneology back to before Christ (literally). More than a few Jews and Muslims; Celts and Anglos; Cathars, Catholics and Byzantines; Africans, Romans, Asians and Indians (both Native American and Eastern); Spanish, Italian, French, English, Dutch, German, Greek, Russian, Ukrainian and Norse!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The more I research Geneology, the more I get how we are ultimately ALL connected and related. Seriously. Pick the fight, I've kin on both sides. World War I/II? Oh yeah. Civil War? Yep, both sides. Salem Witch Trials? Both the condemned and the accuser. Republican vs. Democrate? Cousin George ain't done me proud, but Cousin Bill had a lot of fun. Hundred Years War, Franco-Prussian, Irish vs. English, Christian vs. Jew, go ahead name the fight! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Folks, there is no "Them", there's only "Us". When will we all get that? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm grateful to be a racially impure polyglot. It makes me infinitly more interesting! <br/> 
 <br/> 
BTW, how many of you would argue that it's your moral purity that makes you all that interesting? So why are we that "impure" is anything less than a compliment?

      i love how it is supposed to be surreal and hallucinatory for there to be a talking animal prostitute in this strip only because it is a non-mammal/(non-snake). i mean, when it was fine for an intellectual cat-pervert pay money to a stuffed tiger to stick a vibrator in a cup of coffee, i assumed that our disbelief had long stopped swinging and kicking from the rafters with the chair kicked out under it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i hope that this actually turns into an arc where this makes sense in the achewood universe. the rules of achewood have been drifting for a while...i don't think we would see something like roast beef hanging out on the moon again anytime soon, and without question or it being qualified as 'magic realism' or something.  <br/> 
yeah, it's cool when the style of humor develops over time, but maybe if the rules weren't slowly tightening we wouldn't get these 'surrealist' non-sequitur strips as release valves. i mean, i do like them in a way, though....however, they seem to set the limits for what's reasonable in the 'real' strips, and this one polices it pretty tightly (yeah, i'm writing a thesis now...). when a cat can't engage in relations with a bird, i'm left deeply troubled. <br/> 
what is mean to say is: i miss blister and trouble man and no-no. <br/> 
i dunno...maybe my opinion is just a result of the way that i go through the archives.

      to clarify, this is not supposed to be a 'this is the way achewood should be' complaint. i'm just nostalgic for when strange things played a different role in the comic. roast beef on the moon negotiating with ray was an awesome metaphor for working through depression. molly leaving heaven for beef before it gets burnt down...same kind of thing going down, although a tad more abstract. journeying through hell has all kinds of literary references up in there. the great outdoor fight, although more realistic, was pretty mythical in register. even things like asshole robots with were nice foils to the main characters (with their machine one-dimensionality in opposition to the cats slowly growing more nuanced), although that kinda fell apart more quickly.  <br/> 
i guess the weirdness used to be part of the storytelling, not an exception or departure from the characters doing funny things in the context of domesticity.  <br/> 
yeah, not all of the weirdness in the ol' times was directly related to character development and such...but (and i know that this is going to probably get lamed a lot) i would rather have the weirdness take the form as a set up for lie-bot pulling the same kind of thing on phillipe a dozen times than for the joke to be that the strip is 'wacky', as might possibly be the case here. achewood is still hella funny, so that's cool. i'm just waxin and wishin...

      shit, i just realized what's going down: <br/> 
 <br/> 
the last two strips defined and illustrated the formula of setting up an expectation and breaking them with the punchline. this is the strip that departs from that kind of formula in its style of humor...which actually puts it in the position of the punchline in the formula, assuming that monday and tuesday were the set up. this strip is like part of an arc that began at the beginning of the week. <br/> 
 <br/> 
so, yeah, the weirdness is still at the heart of it and i should shut the hell up because it looks like onstad knows what he is doing.

      yeah, i guess that's true...i was more picking and choosing which ones looked more consciously literary and i guess i just remembered the instances i liked.  <br/> 
i didn't like the mexican magic realist arc too much (or the aborted evil banjo arc...or the shoe-brothers), but i thought the cartilage head thing was just done well and didn't need to make sense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
my point wasn't that weird things didn't used to always make sense...just that they weren't always non-sequiturs and the rules allowed them to happen alongside 'normal' things more often. i do enjoy the ones that don't make sense...but i like it better when they are *allowed* to make sense more often. but now that i think i see the function of this strip, i've come around and will now stop typing.

 <em>She had a young face, painted very thick. It was really the paint that appealed to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips.<br/>
<br/>
There was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the table, turned down very low.<br/>
<br/>
She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of preliminary, in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up her skirt.<br/>
<br/>
I turned up the lamp.<br/>
<br/>
When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years old at least. But I went ahead and did it just the same.</em>

      It occurs to me that, out of context, that's pretty oblique. It's from Orwell's  <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's a vaguely Lynchian dream-logic at work here, I think. Ray doesn't want a prostitute anymore, he certainly doesn't want  <em>this</em>  one, but he knows with glacial inevitability that he's going to have to fuck that bird.

      <em>The dream is always the same. Instead of going home, I go to the neighbors'. I ring, but nobody answers. The door is open, so I go inside. I'm looking around for the people, but nobody seems to be there. And then I hear the shower running, so I go upstairs to see what's what. Then I see her; this... girl, this incredible girl. I mean, what she's doing there I don't know, because she doesn't live there... but it's a dream, so I go with it. "Who's there?" she says. "Joel," I say. "What are you doing here?" "I don't know what I'm doing here; what are *you* doing here?" "I'm taking a shower," she says. Then I give her: "You want me to go?" "No," she says; "I want you to wash my back." So now, I'm gettin' enthusiastic about this dream. So I go to her, but she's hard to find through all the steam and stuff; I keep losing her. Finally I get to the door... and I... find myself in a room full of kids taking their college boards. I'm over three hours late; I've got two minutes to take the whole test. I've... just made a terrible mistake. I'll never get to college. My life is ruined.</em>

I can't believe no one got the quote! (Maybe they did, but didn't care?) I loved that movie. I snuck out of school and used a borrowed ID to see. "Lana" haunted my fantasies for monthes! <br/> 
 <br/> 
But this strip is more like, I'm expecting "Lana", and "Jackie" shows up, with her mixed race kid. And he don't even know he's mixed race, and gets all upset about being called it. And then, like, it's a complete pity-fuck, because like, it wouldn't be cool just to put her out, and I couldn't insult her worse by just paying her off. So no matter how bad it gets, I know I'm paying like twice the fee, and finding a new agency tomorrow. Maybe I'll have to move....

      I think this is like that scene in "Fire Walk With Me" where the little guy is talking backwards and making no sense... but it actually does on some subconscious level.  <br/> 
Eg: "Ray? Ray I'm a prostitute." Is an odd salutation. More is revealed when you play it backwards.

      I'm noticing a strong similarity between the mother's face and the faces of some cartoon aliens from a children's book. All I remember for certain is that the aliens were birdlike and enjoyed jumping; the book taught some kind of important lesson about jumping. (I think they lived on the moon and took advantage of the lower gravity. I'm also vaguely recalling that some of them attended a "Mooniversity.") Is any of this striking a bell for anyone else?

      It is a distinct and indescribable pleasure that every man who enjoys booze should try at least twice.  I recommend it be tried thusly.  Buy a bottle.  Estimate your tolerance for a 110-proof liquor, and pour 2/3 of that amount into a smaller bottle.  Mail the original bottle to someone in a different state or country.  Have someone you trust hide your keys, wallet, and cell phone from you.  Drink a lot of water and have some aspirin.  Make sure you are near a toilet and your own bed.  Drink the absinthe slowly, poured very cold over sugar cubes.  Watch baseball and go to sleep happy.  Hopefully wake up the next day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ever since I figured out the right way to drink absinthe it's been good clean fun.

      Absinthe is really not as scary as legend has made it out to be. You get a very lucid buzz and a very nice 'aura' but no nightmare-inducing hallucinations, and this is with the real stuff from the Czech republic that has a decent amount of thujone (most other countries restrict the thujone content). It helps if you create some sort of atmosphere - a darkened room, preferably with candles, a member of the sex to which you happen to be attracted, and something suitably dark on the juke. Do not under any circumstances watch baseball.

      I haven't had any Czech absinthe.  I've had French, Spanish, Swiss, and German.  Can you really tell the difference with the higher-thujone Czech stuff?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I agree that the reputation it has is way overblown but light drinkers should not try it at all, mainly due to the high alcohol content.  It gives me a great happy creative buzz.  You are wrong about one thing: watching baseball while drinking absinthe is fantastic.  Preferably a Dodgers-Padres game with Vin Scully.

      I haven't had the highest concentration Czech stuff. The bottle of Trul that I have is 35mg/kg. I believe there are some that go as high as 70. Supposedly the stuff they drank back in the day went up to 260. I haven't had any of the lower-content stuff either, so I can't compare, but the feeling is very distinct and lasts several hours. Most other types of alcohol make me sleepy rather quickly.

      Poor Ray.  I feel for the guy.  If you're unhappy with most products or services, you can either return them, demand a refund, or not consume them.  To do any of those things with the services in question profoundly humiliates the buyer and the seller.  You're committed to doing something sordid you now have no desire to do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Doing sordid things should be more fun than this.  Dunkel ist das Leben, ist der Tod.  Darkness is life, darkness is death.

      The agency only deals with toy distribution and Hasbro merchandising to rural Toys R Us stores.  It's Ray who fucked up here by getting blitzed and buying the company rolodex off of a fellow Crawler at the party.  They probably looked at a brochure together and ratcheted up the dares and loose talk.   <br/>

      I apologise if this has already been said, but what if... the smaller one is actually the mother? Or perhaps not even a woman?! At first, I thought her son was getting in to bed because I didn't realise how small they both were, but then I thought perhaps I was operating under a false assumption; the prostitute could, in fact, be either gender, and it is never said which strange creature the son is... I sense I'm thinking about this too much.
