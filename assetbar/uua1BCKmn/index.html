      I'm not an expert by any means, but I'm  <em>fairly</em>  sure there's nothing malicious in wim9k's site-redirect thing; if there is, it's embedded somehwere I can't get to it. The only piece of code in the page source I'm not sure about is the following: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>onLoad="rateAsset('M^a11f09b8576e606bcb5038dfdb92fb821', 'M^1562', 5)"</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
If looks like assetbar javascript that does something silly, but I ain't sure what. If anyone knows, speak up. Anyway, you should still probably run antivirus software and ignore wim9k ASAP.

      Now that I look at the sidebar, it appears that what that code's doing is rating this strip a 5 when you mouseover. Or is this strip an instant classic and I just missed it?

      the rateAsset script is a script that is part of assetbar.  It is the script that is called when you rate the current strip.. 1 2 3 4 or 5.   <br/> 
so far I have gotten it so when anyone mouses over my avicon and my status is displayed, what happens is that user automatically rates the strip as a 999999 (which shows as a 5) and also the user automatically lames the above comment by achilleselbow. <br/> 
it was a real bitch getting it to work without crashing the browser in an endless series of recursive redirects.  but I put in that effort for you guys.  because I am nice. <br/> 
ignoring me won't help because I'm going to be creating lots of accounts that do the same thing so there will be ample opportunity for everyone to mouse over affected accounts. <br/> 
 <br/> 
javascript is a real bitch when you don't know what the fuck you're doing, all googling to find out what the functions do and such.

      what I had to do is put a script in the "My Status" field which is a sort of bootloader script if you will.  only the "my status" field is rendered when you mouse over someone's avitar, which is great, but unfortunately that field is limited to too few characters to do much of anything, so instead I use a really short script in the "my status" field to load a page on my midconet.net server which in turn redirects to my public profile page on assetbar, whereupon the "In My Own Words" field is rendered.  that field is long enough to load up lots of script.  I tried having the scripts be called from the page directly on my server but, shit if I know how to make that work, you know...  I'm not that much of a genius with javascript.

      so yeah basically my script bootstraps it's self by forcing, in a round about way, my public profile page to load, where the actual scripts that lame the above comment and rate the strip a 99999 are stored.

      A friend of mine who does not taste nearly as much semen as he would like has assured me that, yes, it most certainly does. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Other anecdotal evidence strongly indicates that while asparagus gives it a foul odor, as if also commonly understood to occur to urine, sweet fruits, cucumber, and other foods will often impart a more pleasing taste. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically smoking is the worst thing you can do to make you semen taste bad. Drinking, I am told, also does it no sense of good, cheese and red meat are apparently bad as well. Fruits are generally good but some vegetables with strong flavors tend to have a negative effect.

      My ex attested to pineapple as the ultimate semen infusion.  She brought me some on our second date, and although she enjoyed the act of fellatio regardless, she did seem to enjoy my bodily expulsion to a greater degree, thanks to an average serving of pineapple. <br/>

      Are you saying that you can improve the flavor of semen with a single serve of pineapple administered mere hours before ejaculation? That semen flavor is not a question of long term lifestyle choices, but more just having a fruit cup during your preparations before going out? <br/> 
 <br/> 
(For the record, I live on red meat, beer, scotch and cigars and the chicks are mad hungry for my semen. One shot in the mouth and they%u2019re lifelong addicts.)

      Long-term lifestyle changes seem to be most effective, but it will still have an effect from recent ingestion. I just doubt that it would have that much of a change in that short a period of time. I'll check with friends tomorrow though and see what the average time seems to be. In the meantime, damn, you brought it to this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
1 Cup pineapple (fresh, canned, or juice) <br/> 
1 Cup mango juice <br/> 
1 banana <br/> 
1/2 cucumber, peeled and seeded <br/> 
1/2 tsp. fresh ginger <br/> 
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract <br/> 
2 Tbl. honey <br/> 
 <br/> 
1)Blend <br/> 
2)Drink <br/> 
3)Ejaculate <br/> 
 <br/> 
Feel free to modify the basic recipe. Though I'm not sure if yogurt would have a negative effect or not so it might be best to keep it out. Using apple or other sweet juices as a liquid base would also likely work if you wanted to add in fresh or frozen mango chunks.

      Well, I checked with a friend and we got all science-style on it and arrived at the general conclusion that it should take about 3-4 hours to properly be ingested, pass into the small intestine and have esters and sugars (which are doing the work) get absorbed out. So it's not that unreasonable. The lasting time of effect was estimated at around 12 hours more or less and strongly depending on what else you might eat in that time.

      I've previously supported the idea of sex before dating. I mean, do you want to start getting into a relationship and really caring about someone only to find out that you're sexually incompatible? It'll just lead to hurt feelings and all sorts of complications where you probably just end up putting up with it forever and building all sorts of lingering resentment. Not cool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Instead if you start off with the sex and that works then even if they turn out to be a terrible person at least you got some fun sex out of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Get the shallow, basic stuff out of the way first, then you can start building the deeper stuff.

      Clarification: I was talking about furtive sex as in the lady not knowing about it, not like furtive consensual sex in public, which I am led to understand is actually quite good as it has a number of websites devoted to it. Basically, I was trying to make a rape joke and failed miserably. Boy, have I learned my lesson.

      You might work it into a standup schtick where you tell a one-liner that no one gets, pause; then go into a lengthy, straight-faced analysis of the joke where you conclude that you are a failure as a comedian and you have learned your lesson forever, totally straight-faced like Steven Wright. <br/> 
This is what I am seeing. <br/>

      It may be naive, but I believe the subway sex videos are real. I don't remember when, how or why I came to that decision, but I somehow feel pretty sure of it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like the video I watched when I was sixteen where the girl nails the guy's scrotum to a ladder and then rips the ladder away and the guy sits there gushing sack blood for, like, three minutes and then the video ends. I want to think that it's fake, but I can't believe that the scummy dude making the grainy-ass camcorder video ( <em>way</em>  pre-CGI) had the special effects budget to make it look as real as it did. Likewise, I can't believe that these teenagers making these public transportation porn clips would have the kind of resources to rent a goddamned public bus and then have enough left over to pay a bunch of old people to act like they're being scandalized by it.  <br/>

And I had no idea Kasper Hauser was a comedy group. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to note that I still get a little panic attack at the mention of the name, on account of my seeing the movie on the kid of the same name when I was way to young.

      I have seen a video where I clearly recognized where it was shot. Ironically it was a straight video, but shot, more or less, in the Castro. All I'm sayin' is that some are definitely real. Can't say too much about the public transit ones. I haven't seen that yet. <br/>

That is, aside from when I saw a trans hooker giving a guy a blowjob in the back of a bus one evening.

      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101102220330/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=01082002">This one</a>  comes immediately to mind, as do the photo strips (rain gutter on Christmas, and the crushing sounds of non-production). Some of the earlier strips from when Achewood didn't seem to know what it wanted to be were definitely a little shaky. For a more current example, there might be an argument to be made that the 'Ray, I'm a prostitute' and Achewood Machine strips veered a little far into self-indulgence. I personally wouldn't make it, but I could understand if one were more entertained by the screwball humour of the Cumbrella strip than the more alienating stuff that Onstad turns out sometimes.

      He could also be talking about "yellow bone[d]" African-American women.  There's this whole "red bone", "yellow bone" (and perhaps "other bone") thing among at least some AA men (and possibly women, I guess-I've got to cover all my bases here).  I don't know all of the details, but I think "yellow bone" refers to lighter-skinned AA women.  It might also apply to men, but I've never heard it used in that context.  But I don't claim anything other than the vaguest of notions about it. <br/>

      I've been smoking since my mid teens, and I'm starting to think about the painful death aspect of the whole business. That point in time where I cough blood into a handkerchief and limp off to see the doctor, already knowing the diagnosis, seems much closer than it did when I was sixteen. The funny thing is that I've reacted by smoking much more. Now that my gloomy mind has accepted death as an inevitability I'm overcome with a desire to go out in an unrepentant miasma of fag ash and sputum, rather than limp into eternity as some sort of social smoker mewling 'but I only smoke at parties' at the Grim Reaper.

      Branding of narcotics is common (cf.  <em>American Gangster</em> ).  The problem is that once you establish a desired brand (e.g., blue coke), other unscrupulous dealers will copy you and dilute your mark.

      Well OK. Let me just put my part of the conversation to rest by assuring you that my habit of smoking hash (or usually just weed here in The States) has nothing in common with my addiction to nicotine. I am well acquainted with addiction and hash does not cause it. You could call the way I feel about pot a "psychological addiction" if you're a fan of imaginary ideas.

Almost to the point where all I would do was live. It's all I could think about. I was addicted to life, I can admit that now. One day during lunch break, I believe it was in '05, a good friend approached me with a bent cocacola can and a good-time look on his face. from that time on I have been high on bent coca cola cans.

In South Florida in the early 90s popular choices included Drain-O and piss.  So is it safe to add food coloring?  Sure, but the Drain-O provides a great color too!

      I started smoking because of the BUZZ.  I was 14.  If i had known about pot or booze or any other buzz ever i would never have started smoking, but it was the first honest buzz i'd ever had without having to hang upside down or run 3 miles.  I then hung out with other people who smoked, to the exclusion of non smokers, and that reinforced the habit for years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I quit after 10 years; I've been tobacco free for about 1.5 years now.  I occasionally have dreams where I'll be around a smoking friend and light up, but I do feel horrible about it in the dream.

      I'm pretty sure the guy was known for being a dictator and abstaining from not being a dick about it. Don't make me go to a library to check the microfilms of the newspapers that say what he was known for. And 007 sometimes needs a cigarette to take a break from having no bad taste in his semen (because his balls are broke so there is no taste of nothing).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously man, don't get all factual, I'm just saying I'm trying to quit. Let me hope there's hope. Hitler banned and criminalized smoking like he did critical thinking, but last thing I need is associate the two and feel like I'm surrendering when I get rid of my last pack (me being French and all).

      Having one's testicles bashed, mashed, otherwise ruined or deftly removed  <em>will</em>  remove sperm from semen, but it's the friendly prostate (aka butthole buzz button) that produces the seminal fluid -- by far the largest component of ejaculate -- and is the vehicle of flavors and aromas.  The sperm are just hitching a ride.  If the testicles produce the minimum requirement of hormones a man can be completely aspermatic and one would be hard pressed to notice any difference in his ejaculate.

      Off Topic, but: Yesterday, at Waffle House I got the counterman who is cousin to the Steven the Strong (and overly-personal) Waiter. He told me my selection of the Chicken Biscuit for breakfast was "excellent" and when I ordered coffee he said (I am not making this up) "Yes, that's good, that's exactly right for you." (We've never met.) When he brought the bill he told me that he thought I'd made good "choices". (I'm out of work and two years ago married a woman who had three kids. Do the math.) He wasn't quite as thick in the pecs as Steven, but he was a tall, broads-shouldered guy.  <br/> 
(If you don't know Steven, he was introduced by Liebot on November 7, 2001. He's a waiter at Denny's, who praises his customers for their wise choices of breakfast menu items. <br/> 
And my waiter was NOT EVEN A GOOD WAITER. I had to get the bored, tired, slightly-overweight counter girl to refill my coffee EVERY TIME. <br/> 
I hope this guy moves on this fated sales job really soon. And then gets a horrible disease.

      I wouldn't say quick as anything.  A few pipes a day isn't anywhere close to being as bad for your health as cigarettes.  In fact some studies showed moderate pipe smokers living longer than the non-smokers in the study because of the psychological benefits.  Now I know pipe smoking isn't what you'd call healthy, but it isn't any worse than pouring grain alcohol mixed with kool aid down your gullet on the weekends, or shoveling in heaps of grease-soaked fried foods.  Now if you'll excuse me I've got a bowl of Escudo in my favorite smooth grain Bjarne waiting for me.  Carry on, chaps.

      Well, since we've gone there, let's stay. Dudes, how many of you have tried your own?

      I don't know why I should tell you this, and I'm sure I will regret it immediately after I press post, but I feel strongly compelled to be honest. I have been there, twice. Once, quite a while ago, in a spirit of solo curiosity, and once again more recently when egged on by a self consciously 'unconventional' sex partner. My tasting notes are: distinctive but perfectly inoffensive taste, no saltiness whatsoever (why have we been lied to about this?), highly unpleasant glutinous texture, disquieting warmth. Due to the aforementioned texture I couldn't bring myself to swallow either time.

Speaking of afterbirth, I feel the same way about people who eat their placenta, or the placenta of others.  It isn't something you were ever really  <em>supposed</em>  to eat. <br/>

      I would eat placenta. I'm prepared to countenance eating pretty much anything that is eaten for pleasure (as opposed to personal kinkiness, hence no urine or shit). If a significant number of people enjoy eating something, then I'm just curious as to what it tastes like. A bad taste lasts a couple of minutes at most, but ignorance is forever. I don't want to get into a macho list of weird stuff I've eaten, but suffice to say I've had plenty of things which were odd and unappealing to modern western tastes, and still the three worse things I've ever tasted were soy milk, filet o fish and Beef and Tomato flavored pot noodle.

      aw rowboat, I didn't specifically mean anybody, because as it turns out, it is a pretty common male...interest. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just wonder why, because we have a sort of natural aversion to ingesting our waste otherwise, because it is biologically unhealthy for us (as an animal, and all), but I suppose the same biological hazard doesn't exist for sexual secretions, so people don't have the same instant "oh ewwww" reaction. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think it is  <em>that</em>  gross, but I don't really get why there is more curiosity about that fluid than say, urine.  Then I sort of answer my own question; because drinking urine is very unhealthy for humans, after all, it is waste.  Semen isn't neccesarily unhealthy--it isn't  <em>really</em>  the same as the waste we expel. <br/>

      I was thinking the other day that one of the reasons we likely have an aversion to scent and nature of our own waste (including body odor which is largely caused by sweat and our bodily bacteria) is simply because they would be used in the wild to track us. We don't want to be anywhere near something with a strong odor that could be used by a predator to locate our position and eat us so we find it objectionable and want to be far away from it.

      these aversions are culturally learned.  your postulate falls apart when you consider that people like perfumes.  Which is ironic, because perfumes, for the most part, are mixtures of chemicals that cause cancer and other diseases, especially in small children.  But people loooove fragrance and such.  People are idiots.

The Natural Resource Defense Council sent 14 air fresheners to be tested for phthalates in an independent lab. The tests found that 12 products, including those marked "all natural," contained phthalates. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lab animal studies show that some phthalates interfere with hormonal systems, disrupt testosterone production and cause malformation of sex organs. Some studies of humans have shown a link between exposure and adverse changes in the genitals of baby boys.

Like, Glade? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe, I don't know, maybe that shit has more harmful things in it.  Perfume, however, is alcohol and oil.  A lot of them use natural oils, the extracts derived from various plants, and civet or other animal musks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Others use synthetic bouquets, which are more or less combinations of natural oils put together to resemble a different smell; lets say tonka bean plus cocoa leaf essence becomes 'chocolate cake'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some are synthetically produced scented oils; of the same style, made by the same company, that creates flavor oils you probably ingest every day.

      Synthetic bouquet are more when they take a benzote or chemical aromate in place of essential oils.  <br/> 
As a chemist i had to extract essentials oils in lab, and i can say that it's painstakingly long for low results. Nowaday they mostly use synthetic aromate since it's much easier to mass produce

      Oh, I know it is mostly synthetics (and synthetic bouquets, but natural is still used) in commercial perfumes.

The EU was actually looking to ban certain essential oils recently, oakmoss I believe, and citrus oils, and that is why I'm so on edge about fragrances.

      Well, from a chemical standpoint, if they tried making the exact same organic oil there would be no problem. Sadly they mostly use ersatz since they are much more easier to produce. But anyway, if you keep to true natural produces it should be ok.

      Or because it's waste? Urine turns into a decent source of infection minutes after it's out of us, and shit is shit. On the other hand, most people have no problem sucking their own blood out of a paper cut, yet the smell of iron given out by blood is one sure-shot way of picking the scent of a wounded prey. Most animals I can think of that bury their crap (cats and dogs, I can't really think of too many animals) are predators more than prey.  <br/> 
It's just a counter point; you could actually be very much right.

      I'm also reminded that, much like your point would agree with, apparently most herbivores have fairly inoffensive shit... at least, according to my girlfriend when she worked at the petting zoo in high school. It's the carnivores and omnivores that tend to cause problems.

      Has that been reliably proven in humans? I mean... I don't always have the best sense of smell and it never seems to be an issue for me. Frankly I'd say most of the available evidence seems to indicate that males, at least, tend to receive far more stimulation and interest from visual stimulae than olfactory.

      this comic illustrates the addictive nature of cigs.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
but there's the 'attractive' appeal of cigs as well. i mean, i don't look at someone smoking and find it attractive. but historically, in ads and movies, smoking cigs is portrayed as attractive or sexy. like seeing humphrey bogart light up lauren bacall.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
it holds true in modern movies. i mean, i HATE cigs. i won't hang out with people who smoke. i don't visit relatives who smoke. won't hang out in bars where people smoke. hate the shit. but still.. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i'll watch a movie. for instance an old western, like "The Professionals". the guys in there smoke and they make it look like the breath of life. like it's wholesome and healthy. like it's keeping them alive.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
and a movie like "Factotum".. they make it look like cigs can satisfy a need you don't even know you have. like this mysterious need between hunger and thirst. those characters in the movies actually make smoking look 'fun' or 'good'.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
but they also make pulling down gulps or rot-gut whiskey early in the morning or in mid-day beat down desert heat look good.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
as for the strip.. a 3.5 if i still rated strips. good, not great. i like it that Beef imagines his son.

      Well since it started to taste like he'd been docking with the Marlboro Man she is no longer good for having fun-times in the mouth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for this specific occasion I don't think he's trying to be sexist. I think this is more clearly from Onstad's perspective as he works through the cares he has from his own desire to quit smoking. These are his worries, not necessarily the only things that a lady is good for. As far as he is concerned the only thing he is good for is dying and being yelled at.

      Molly was written, and to some extent is still serving as a female analogue to Roast Beef.  She was a programmer, she was dead, she for some reason totally accepted constant depression, whatever, but she had some character of her own. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like, a lot of the earlier strips when she first came back from being dead, she had more character, more of her own unique sort of traits.  Like when she was working, whatever; she at least had lines that concerned things other than the present state of Roast Beef's dong.  Ever since they got married, she's become a lot more a caricature of what a lot of men think of when they think of "wife".  Nagging shrew that will occasionally suck/comment on your genitals. <br/>

Art imitates life, maybe, because a lot of men (and women, for that matter) grow to resent (and caricaturize) their spouses after marriage.

      In this particular strip, that is not Molly.  What is shown is a set of Roast Beef's insecurities that takes the form of Molly in his imagination.  His most significant support in life berating and rejecting him.  Anyway, not necessarily proof of Onstad's sexism.

      Molly is not a regular character in this comic.  Her character has never been developed beyond cliche.  I'm sorry if you want achewood to have a regular female character, but sadly, it doesn't.

      okay, maybe she's been somewhat developed, but, not lately, and, Molly's development was more an attempt to make her into more of a rounded person than the other Achewood characters, meaning, she's basically not an Achewood character.  Achewood characters are sick and twisted and not very well rounded.  They each have this metaphorical water-melon sized tumor growth from whose shadow they never fully escape.  Only RBeef is really dynamic and has really undergone any hints of evolving and learning... That seems to be where a lot of Onstad's creativity is focused.  I just don't see Molly getting similar development as RBeef... two characters competing for the author's attention, you know... it ain't gonna happen.. if it was going to happen, it would have happened by now.  Especially since Molly and RBeef have ostensibly intertwined lives... it's one thing to really develop one character... but to develop two characters, to really develop them, and then also simultaneously the interaction of these two characters with one another?  Some authors might do that, but, in this case, it ain't happening.  One character will be usually a prop for the other character. <br/>

      Beef is obviously new at this whole thing. Soon he will find out that the garden hose sure isn't gonna cut it - when you smoke and you have a significant other who doesn't want you to, they will know. They ALWAYS know. It's some creepy sense they acquire.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Luckily for me, all of my bedmates have been seduced into trying a fag every now and then, and soon we were the happiest of smoking couples. Added bonus: since I convince them to smoke before breaking up with them, I now have an ex boyfriend and girlfriend who I hold animosity for but I can take heart in the fact that they are currently slashing years from their lives because of a habit that I started. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Um. Does that make me evil?

      I smoked socially for years, delighted to sample cigs from all over the world, then quit when I had kids in the house.  Nicotine is very addicting, but my will is stronger.  Now I've taken up Sherman's again, but don't inhale.  One or two a day will do me.  It's a great buzz.

      slipped again, now to post on sunday, and he's apologizing for not getting it done on time.  is anyone suprised. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad you can apologize the first time you dont get it done on time, and the second in some circumstances, but when it's every dang strip you should just give up even trying to publicly schedule your releases.  People are gonna check back even if you tell them you're never releasing another strip, so why bother?  It's painful to watch you flail so publicly. <br/>

      it's just like writing you know here's the thing <br/> 
you may not know how to punctuate and capitalize when you are a young age and you can learn quickly when your mind is fresh and able but when you get older and your stupidity sets in you find yourself unable to reach over to the shift bar and lose all ability to write a comprehensive thought and are then unable to land a job which will cause your wife to leave you with your two fetal alcohol syndrome borned kids to a rotting apartment with a dead cat who died just so youd be more lonely and no one calls you anymore but they cant anyway since you stopped paying the phonebill i mean no one calls you anyway and eventually the squalor builds up and up and stinks more and more but you are used to sleeping next to the smell of your feces everynight and then you eat some moldy something you find behind the couch and just drift away . . .and they find your body two months later, when the roof collapses from the mold <br/> 
preacher all having nothing to say about you because he has no idea who you are and what your personal qualities are and what makes you you so he just reads a verse from corinthians and shakes the invisible hands and just goes home <br/>

      mmmm...  exactly...  a lot of people in society think of organizational structure as a hierarchical "pile" and are otherwise retarded; a lot of society's organizations tend to be correspondingly retarded, and I try to keep my distance.  Most people in management aren't there for the remuneration and remuneration to effort / time invested ratio, (which in many cases are actually inferior anyway...) no, most people are in management/HR because they are retarded.

      google andrew wommack.  shit's hilarious! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Within a month, I learned that the salesman had run off with our money. In fact, he%u2019d burned several other well-known preachers at the same time! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember when I heard this news. My employee said, %u201CThis salesman just took our $27,000.We%u2019re going to have to come up with an additional $45,000 just in the next week or so to be able to make this project work. All together, we%u2019re looking at about $70,000.%u201D <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sevenfold <br/> 
 <br/> 
My first reaction was shock. Is this really true? Then came a fleshly twinge of wanting to beat up this salesman. But I recognized who the real culprit was. Satan had come against me and was trying to steal from me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
    Immediately, Proverbs 6:31 came to mind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
    But if [a thief] be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I recognized that this wasn%u2019t just a person trying to steal from me. Obviously, there were demonic entities working behind the scenes. So within seconds of getting this news, I realized, This is the devil stealing from me, and I%u2019ve caught him. Therefore, according to the Word of God, I demand it back seven times! Immediately, I took a piece of paper and figured out seven times $70,000.Instead of being angry, depressed, and hurt, I started dancing and praising God, saying, %u201CHallelujah, this is awesome. I%u2019m getting $490,000 back this year!%u201D As I continued praising God, that situation never did get me down or discouraged. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When that year was over, we had increased nearly to the penny $490,000%u2014exactly seven times the amount of money that was taken from us. That was back during a period of time when our entire income was only about $500,000 a year. We nearly doubled our income that year! <br/> 
 <br/> 
What could have been a tragic scenario turned into a positive situation because I recognized that I%u2019m not fighting flesh and blood. I%u2019m fighting a spiritual battle, with spiritual weapons, against spiritual enemies. I realized that Satan was trying to come against me, and then acted on the Word.

      It was loud and he could hardly breathe, so I got up, prayed in tongues, rebuked the croup, and released my faith. He went back to sleep and everything was fine. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thirty minutes later, the same thing happened. I got up, prayed over him, and he went back to sleep. Every thirty minutes, I was up and down like a yo-yo, praying over our son and trying to get him back to sleep. Finally, about three in the morning on one of my trips back to bed, my mother said, %u201CAdmit it, Andy. He%u2019s sick!%u201D <br/> 
 <br/> 
I got right down there, stuck my finger in her face, and said, %u201CSatan, in the name of Jesus, I command you to shut up! I will not receive any of your criticism or any of your curses. My son is blessed and not cursed!%u201D Then I started speaking the Word. Mother never said another word, and our son never got up again that night. He was just fine, but Mother didn%u2019t say anything for two whole days%u2014 and we were together all the time in a car on vacation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Finally, when she did speak, she cried, %u201CWell, I%u2019m sorry you think I%u2019m the devil%u201D and started into this self-pity party. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I said, %u201CMother, you know enough to know better. I%u2019ve told you the Word of God. You knew that stuff you were saying was exactly opposite the Word. You%u2019d just given yourself over to Satan. I%u2019m not mad at you. I was just standing against the devil. He was trying to steal my faith for healing.%u201D
