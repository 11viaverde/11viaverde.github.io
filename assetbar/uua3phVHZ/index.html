      I'm inclined to agree with you as far as the thread hijacking, given that the election is still over a month away, but I don't really think that a discussion about voting methods and 7-11 products qualifies as a political debate. <br/>

      I have a feeling that this is because DrSkradley is Australian, and here in Australia voting is mandatory. I'll agree that sometimes, mandatory voting is stupid (like in the most recent local government elections - I actually have no idea who I even voted for, there were just nine independents) but it's basically the fundamnetal tenet of democracy that  <em>everyone</em>  votes. Not some people. Not just the people who feel strongly about the election. Everyone. Is it a mild inconvenience to vote? Suck it up. You have to. Although it probably helps that our elections are usually on weekends, and I am given to understand that yours are not. I don't care. If you don't vote, you don't give a shit about democracy. Did I just say if you don't vote you hate America?  <em>Maybe</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way: by "mandatory" I mean "if you don't do it you'll get a $26 fine and a warning that next time it could be  <em>more than that</em> ."

      Wait, is it a problem that there are no voting machines? There aren't, in case that was a legitimate question, the votes get recorded on computers but they are looked upon by people and written upon by pencils. I don't get it. I know we are kinda "behind the times" but at the same time, the computerised versions in the States have  <em>no hardcopy backups</em> . They are entirely untested. Stupid stupid stupid. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, the reason "everyone voting" is vital to democracy is that the idea of democracy is that the party in charge represents the opinion of the majority. These days the majority tends to be less than significant, but at least it is the actual majority of the public, not just the majority of the people who could be bothered to show up at the polls.

      A) There are only a few jurisdictions in the States that use entirely paperless voting machines.  They are indeed jurisdictions led by stupid people. <br/>

B) The States is not a Democracy.  It's a Republic.  I think your second paragraph is entirely irrelevant to the intended functioning of the government of the United States.  Sorry.

      I used to agree with this philosophy. Then I grew up, became formally introduced to the World at Large, and redacted my stance. Some people have no idea what's going on in their own country, and the thought of one of the douchenozzles I've met who can't even name their own prime minister actually showing up to vote scares the hell out of me. (Fortunately, these people are not voting; they will never vote, ever.)

      I think the low voter turn out in the States is due to the long-winded American political campaigns. Compare them to Canada, you get some perspective. In the States, the candidates have been running since like January, and both parties have been preparing for the election for a lot longer than that. The Canadian election was announced less than 2 months ago. The vote is in 2 weeks, and then it will be over. You guys in the US still won't have a president until late January. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Voter turnout in Canada is 76%, whereas turnout in the states is 54% for a congressional election, and less than that for a general election. People are just sick of politics by the time the election rolls around.

      I think when you are talking about a US Presidential election, there is no way to know how higher turnout would effect results.  Since my view is that the uninformed come in all political stripes, any analysis would have to assume an awful lot, and the outcome would mostly be a result of the assumptions.  The Electoral College mechanism and the roughly evenly-divided nature of the US now make the whole idea basically a crapshoot.

      Well, yeah, but on the other hand, do you really want the people who don't vote because it's too inconvenient to be the one choosing the next President? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd like it if everyone felt it was a civic duty to make an informed decision about elections and then vote, but, since they don't, I'd rather have the people who aren't actually going to bother to think about the candidate they vote for just not vote. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Case in point: I know someone who is voting for McCain based  <em>solely</em>  on the fact that Obama's middle name is Hussein. Do you really want  <em>him</em>  exercising the franchise?

Now, on-topic for the comic. The Commodore sounds a lot like The Venus Butterfly, in that it is performed in a hotel room to great effect, ends with room service, and is never adequately explained to the viewer.  <em>Chris Onstad, I hope you realize they are still bothering the L.A.

      It was described to me as simultaneous manual stimulation of everything your hands can reach on a lady's bottom.  Why a "buttefly"?  Put your thumbs next to each other and wiggle your hands and fingers.  That should be enough instruction for a go-getter like you, achilles.  Don't be afraid to also involve your mouth.  In stimulation, I mean, not speaking.

      Not in the same way, they don't.  And that mindset has little to do with anything (it's not my reason for not voting).  All decisions come down to cost/benefit and whether it's worth doing in that regard.  All things considered, it is not worth it for me to vote.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
To give you a littering example (to demonstrate the concept in a way that you seem to want it demonstrated): If I am swimming in the ocean with a piece of garbage in my hand (don't ask, thats just how I roll, baby), and I see someone drowning, it is no longer worth it for me to find a garbage can.  I will litter that shit right into the ocean and save a life.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is an extreme example, but it applies to voting, just on a much smaller scale.  The garbage can is voting booth, and the drowning person is other shit I can do with my time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If your mind works properly, the only problem you can have with my outlook is that I am sharing it and passing it on to others, which has an impact outside of whether I vote or not.  Just remember that I'm not the one who brought up politics in the Achewood comments.  I only replied to the political bullshit that pollutes the few escapes I have from it.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I bet you brilliant motherfuckers don't even see the irony in downvoting/censoring what I have to say while you're supposedly supporting this "everyone gets a fair say and it counts!" mindset. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is my last comment on the matter.  We should remember that we all love Achewood and so are probably not all that different.  If I could talk instead of type comments, I could say it in a tone of voice that you don't misinterpret and get pissed at.  Achewood, go.

      The fact that you find yourself exogenous is far less workable than the lack of desire to vote.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you wish, try living in complete isolation from us petty people. That means, eat only food you grow yourself, use only tools you build yourself, dispose of all of your trash and waste and other by-products of living on your own land, pay no taxes, earn no income, use only electricity you generate yourself with equipment you build yourself - Or just get that you are part of extended systems that are as much a part of you as your ass and mouth and hands, and without which you have no real life. Then decide if it is worth declaring your desires, no matter how individually feeble or misguided, on how you want these systems run and managed.  <br/>

      Lamed not because you don't vote, but because you are not voting for the wrong reason. Don't not vote because you are only one person. theirateturk is completely right - you have no idea what you are talking about in that second paragraph. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am all for looking at voting from a scientific perspective - that's why I'm not voting this year. I hope to vote in the future, but not in this election. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, when you make the argument that your vote almost never counts, you are flat out wrong. Polls are inherently statistical in nature: The purpose of the election poll is to determine who America really wants to be president, and the best way to do that is to get the largest sample size possible. By voting, you are contributing to that sample size. You are not voting for your candidate, you are voting for America (my god that sounds corny in retrospect... but I can't think of a more concise way to make that point). <br/> 
 <br/> 
The way I see it, with that reasoning, you shouldn't vote if and only if you  <em>genuinely do not know</em>  who should be president. Personally, I am at a point where I have heard enough contradicting "facts" from both sides that I have determined I will not know whether I believe McCain or Obama would make a better president. It is my hope that I will be able to discern a clearer truth in future elections (though I doubt it will be an entirely clear truth), and I will vote then, when I can properly choose. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But if you do vote, your vote always counts.

      Why is voting considered such a patriotic act and donating money to candidates considered borderline sleazy?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
My vote for Barack will add nothing because he's already going to win my state by about 20 points, but I'll get to wear an "I Voted" sticker and tell everyone that my opinion matters because I pulled a lever that didn't benefit my candidate at all.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If instead I donated money to him, it would actually help him pursue votes in swing states that matter - but nobody would say I had done anything patriotic - all I'd get is my name published online for purposes of public scrutiny and suspicion.  I know the donations (both which candidates and the amounts) made by some of my friends because they are published online - we wouldn't do that with votes, would we? <br/>

      That's true.  I don't say there's absolutely no value to voting in a locked-up state, but I do think it's odd that we elevate voting so much when there are other ways of being politically involved that actually make a difference.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sometime I would like to see a summary of American voter turnout in states that were considered "in play" at the time of voting.  I think we get an unnecessarily bad rap for our turnout when our biggest states (Texas, California, New York) are basically set in stone. <br/>

      Actually, I was interested enough in this to go get some real facts to see if I was right - and I kind of was, kind of wasn't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Go to page nine of this[url=www.census.gov/prod/2006pubs/p20-556.pdf]Census Bureau report[/url].  It shows turnout by state in 2004. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This isn't quite as much of a spread as I'd expected, and all this is complicated by the fact that there are other races in each state that may affect turnout, but I think the principle holds true - our turnout numbers are dragged down by the (very large) locked up states.

      He was blind, and the visor let him see, to an extent (it was more like infrared than actual sight). In  <em>Star Trek: First Contact</em> , though, technological advances had allowed him to replace his visor with some sort of cybernetic eyes which allowed him to see even better than people with normal vision.

      This will probably only make sense to someone who has achieved substantial Weeaboo levels but my Dudes and I used to joke that some of the  <em>Star Trek</em>  movies were basically like  <em>Star Trek: Endless Waltz</em> ,* especially  <em>Star Trek V</em>  when the characters all had those ridiculous turtlenecks as part of their uniforms. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*Here, the Weeaboo refers to the Japanese anime film  <em>Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz</em> . While movie tie-ins to popular cartoons are commonplace in both American and Japanese milieu,  <em>Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz</em> , a film based on a TV series of the "giant robot/pseudo-philosophical war story" hybrid-genre, was notable for an explicable cosmetic decision made by the artists and producers. For an apparently unclear reason, all of the giant robots or "Gundams" in the movie had different designs and more advanced weaponry than their TV counterparts. Even a flashback from a scene in the TV show where a Gundam appeared had been redrawn so that the newer design of the Gundam appeared. The film seemed to be asserting that the Gundams had always been designed that way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Weeaboos have debated the meaning of this decision for the past decade. Some apply Occam's Razor, saying that this was a cynical marketing ploy to get fans of the show to buy even more action figures and model kits. They cite the 1980s animated film  <em>Transformers</em>  in which it has been documented that a principal reason for the killing of several of the characters was to make room for new characters that children would beg their parents to purchase. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Others have applied symbolic meaning to the gesture, reminding viewers of dialogue delivered by one of the show's villains, Treize Khushrenada, who considers war to have an aesthetic beauty, even projecting this theory onto the whole of humankind, implying that the reasons for war are even more cynical than glory or honor, but for the opportunity to see explosions and gripping battles. Khushrenada cited the very design of giant robots as being more an aesthetic decision than one of military strategy. For this reason, and several other similar scenes,  <em>Gundam Wing</em>  was considered a postmodern literary work that commented insightfully on the "giant robot" anime genre, making it in some ways, Japan's  <em>Watchmen</em> . It's popularity gives credence to the theory that over the past twenty years, Japan has been in a constant state of cumming on its own balls.   <br/>

      I don't remember the exact post from the assetbar_admin introducing the auto-ignore thing or whatever it's called, but I thought it had more to do with accumulated lames than accumlated ignores.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe the assetbar_admin should make this new function clear in the ignore list description, since not everyone may have read the original notice? <br/>

To all those people who want to read the comments of those people that are auto-ignored, just remove them from you ignore list.

      Yea, I think the benefits outweigh the consequences. All you have to do is check the very bottom of the comments on the strip where it shows your collapsed ignores. If you see any names that don't look like aiu clones, you can ctrl-click on the name to view their profile, and click on the number by "comments" to view the first few words of all their recent posts. Then unignore or keep ignored as you wish.

I didn't mean you'd want to ignore a post-chubbied user, just that all the links on the comment are turned off at that point.  Which highlights the fact that there is nothing here that is the opposite of "ignore user."  Maybe we could get a feature that highlights all the comments made by our favorite users?  No, we can just use the "find" function in a browser.  How about something that auto-chubbies spinynorman whenever we log in?

      Just out of curiosity, why exactly don't you want to be one of the first three lames? I thought the whole point of the lame system was so that Assetbarians can filter out stuff like the eighth iteration of the airport story and they didn't have to bother telling the dude off about it. <br/>

      Great question, Nerdinexile.  The last time I actually handed out a lame, I saw it as being in defence of someone who didn't need defending. On re-reading the lamed post, I found that it was actually fairly funny and undesearving of the lame. I realized that in the heat and passion of the moment I had acted a right proper imbecile! So, to clean it up, I randomly chubbied the next three remarks from the gentleman I had undeservedely lamed, and foreswore ever being one of the first three lamers on a post, thus ensuring that heat of the moment wouldn't win the day again! <br/>

I hope that answers it. (Now, aren't you sorry you asked?)

      This was my original complaint when the JIA was announced. I can skip what I want, and don't need a filter to protect me. The request then was (and still is) the ability to opt out of the JIA machine in my profile. It has not yet happened. I can, however, report that my Ignore list remains in pristine shape, and I will still be able to read fooker ad naseum.

      I figure you're in the minority for not wanting to ignore asstards, and this  (if it's a choice between jia for everyone and jia for noone) is the best option on average. <br/>

I only ignore if their content isn't even relevantly annoying, just taking up space.  Alreadyinuse occasionally says something interesting,  his ______ASS_BAR____ accounts do not.

      Too many favorites.  I have the Opus collection (featuring Opus in Sunday comics from Bloom, Outland, and the eponymous current thing) and there's so many good ones.  I think the one where the alien comes and watches Jimmy and Tammy Faye is up there, and a few Christmas/ Birthday ones.  And anything with Bill.

      I mean to ask this yesterday, but... am I missing something with Opus? I usually take a look at the comic syndicated in Salon, and it seems to mostly consist of trite and ham-fisted political truisms. Which I guess is a fair description of Salon in general, but still.

      Hi, long-time reader, first-time poster.  Berkeley Breathed lost it quite some time ago.  I check out the Opus strips every once in a while and am almost always disappointed.  When he's not ripping himself off wholesale, he's writing strips that are less subtle than political cartoonists on a bad day (see "trite and ham-fisted political truisms").  Maybe I've just had a bad sampling, but, hell, even Outland wasn't really that good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's a shame, I guess.  Bloom County has always been my favorite print comic strip (and is number 2 behind Achewood overall), ever since I was wee lad, and even with all its faults, I always thought it was slightly better than say, Calvin or the Farside. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, go to your local used bookstore and you can probably find the old Bloom County collections (I believe they're still out of print and no big memorial collection has been put out, a la the Far Side and Charlie Brown).

      Well, I guess I'm behind the times. I've never heard of this  <em>Opus.</em>  All I know is that  <em>Bloom County</em>  changed my life and  <em>Outand</em>  was at least decent. If  <em>Opus</em>  is as bad as everyone says it is, that makes me sad. I'll find it and judge for myself, as I do have a very deep soft spot for the work of Mr. Breathed and it is possible that it'll still strike a chord with me anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Reading only comics written by Chris Onstad for the past year and a half has left me dumb to the world around me. I don't really mind.

      I would like to say here that I also found that  <em>Opus</em>  sucks so hard that it has made me question in restrospect the quality of  <em>Bloom County.</em>   I really enjoyed the latter when it was first appearing in the 1980s, but I think it would be wrong to put it in a class with  <em>The Far Side</em>  or  <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> .

      Well, it's not easy to say why I prefer Bloom County to Calvin, but one reason would be the characters.  As much as I like Calvin & Hobbes, ultimately you have a very small cast, occasionally you get the parents, the neighbor girl, the teacher, or the bully.  That's pretty much it.  I've read through the Calvin collections dozens of times, but after a while they all start to look the same.  Breathed had a larger cast to work with and often brought in new ones or got rid of old ones to help out.  I can more distinctly remember Bloom County strips and arcs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is hard to explain and sounds stupid to say, but stay with me (or don't): I always found Bloom County to have more imagination, more fun, be more like a comic than Calvin.  As nice-on-water says, it has "spark."  Now, don't get me wrong.  Bill Watterson obviously had fucking boatloads of imagination and everyone loves to pretend that they were as inventive, funny and crazy as Calvin.  Watterson is a great cartoonist and really an incredible writer.  He might, overall, be much more consistent than Breathed (and I'm only counting Bloom County-era Breathed).  I've always respected his position against "selling out" and not merchandising, etc., as I often tend to side with that often oversimplified viewpoint.  I love the fact that C H is almost a philosophical tract (please, don't read too much into this comment, achilleselbow), and can be as dark as it is funny. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But Breathed always seemed like he had more  <em>fun</em> , and that will always show in the comic; to me, at least.  Breathed has a shitload of flaws: he lambasted Jim Davis for basically creating Garfield as a merchandising tool, then went on to merchandise shit himself, if just not as much as Davis.  But he also made fun of himself for it.  He could be annoyingly preachy at times, but these episodes seem to go as quickly as they arrived. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Watterson, for all the wit and imagination in his characters, always seemed to be writing like this kind of feeling was a distant memory to him (I've always thought that, towards the end of C H, it got more preachy, stuffy, angry and less fun, especially).  His humor sometimes seemed a little clinical.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry for all that verbal effluvium.  Basically, it always seemed to me that Breathed enjoyed what he was doing, and that came out in his work.  I can't say I ever felt that vibe from Watterson. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad seems to have found a pretty healthy medium between the two.

      Eh, the artistic similarities have always been annoying and hard to ignore, yeah, and it's not exactly a stretch to say that Breathed's more subtle political jabs and satires didn't often seem a little too Trudeau-esque, but I think there's enough originality in Bloom County to give it a  <em>little</em>  more pull than just being a Doonesbury rip-off. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, yeah, different strokes.  I certainly won't blame anyone for liking Calvin & Hobbes/Farside or a few select other comics better than Bloom County.  They're all great.

      Why can't both be true? Every day's a different mood, and I honestly wouldn't want to choose a world without C & H, Farside or Bloom County (although I'll agree older C & H is better). Can't they three just be great contributions to my life, and our culture, and leave it there?

      The only thing that makes me regard Calvin and Hobbes and the Farside and Peanuts higher (other than the fact that I grew up on C&H and I even like it more than Achewood, and it definitely shaped my sense of humor and writing style etc etc) is that it's so dated.  Celebrities are outright named and depicted and for us now, its age shows.  It's still funny but dated.  Not as sharp as when it first ran.

      Well, popular opinion is a tricky thing. Immediately after the Dow dropped, it went from the majority being against it to something like half and half. And even before the bill failed, the same majority that was against it was also polled as thinking that the government should "do something".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
You have to admit that the vast majority of people have absolutely no conception of economics and little idea of how this could affect them. People are also not good at sorting out their cognitive dissonance - for example, close to half of them are still going to vote for a guy who will continue a war that the majority of people now think was a bad idea and which is costing far more than the bailout. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All of which is not to say that it's a good idea. The only way I'd support it is if it came with much heavier regulation, which is not going to happen.

      You do realize that the existing regulations were largely responsible for this mess in the first place, yes? So why would you want more regulation? That would be a bit like smoking an extra pack a day to try to get rid of your lung cancer.

      I think we've had this argument before. It's a double-tiered thing. You're right in the sense that the original framework in which we created private companies with government backing was the root of the problem, but the problem was further exacerbated by the lack of regulation which was subsequently applied to those companies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I realize that you can go one of two ways with the solution, either European-style regulation like when Sweden solved a very similar crisis by basically nationalizing the companies that they bailed out, or the Ron Paul idea of ending corporate subsidies and actually having a completely free market, both of which are better than the current system where the government basically subsidizes private companies to provide the services that people nevertheless expect. But you'll pardon me if I point out that the first method has been applied successfully throughout Europe, whereas the second exists purely in Ron Paul's mind as far as I know.

      I have a response for this, telling you pretty much exactly where you are wrong. But I'm not going to post it because this isn't the place for these discussions, and I shouldn't have even gotten this involved, and anyway it would be pointless because you will disagree, whether what I say is backed by facts or not. <br/>

Basically what I am saying is I am bowing out and will try harder to avoid these things in the future. I don't think political discussion is appropriate or productive on assetbar.

      There was a whole scenario involving "milking the prostate". I think in the middle of the movie they're just talking about it and thinking it's kind of gross, and then at the end during the "where they are now" part, it is revealed that the tall douchy guy is dating a med student and you hear her asking "Two fingers?" and him answering "Did I say two? Better make it three." <br/>

      That's right. They were raising money to continue the trip by donating to a sperm bank, and he was putting moves on the pretty nurse, saying that she could really help him complete the order, and she's all like, "yeah, there's something we can do to help." <br/> 
 <br/> 
He was already a perv, and this did nothing to help. <br/>

The worst scene was when Tom Green placed a live white mouse completely in his mouth while trying to show a disinterested snake what it was suppose to do with it. I guess if they had shown felching, that would have top it.

You are seeing the calm before the storm, as she really puts together what just happened, and how to best retaliate. If Ray's lucky, she will retaliate hot and early. Because, damn, if Tina takes this one cold later, Ray's in trouble! <br/>

 Pertaining or relating to a  <em>Metapore</em> , a pore contemplating upon itself.  <br/> 
The entomological origins of the term arise in ancient Grease where the term was applied to the lesser known theories of matter. Some ancient philosophers believed this  <em>metaporical</em>  substance, much like  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">ether</span>  existed throughout space.  <br/> 
Ex.: I seem to be growing more and more metaporical substance on my face. The teenager dripped metaporical ooze upon his philosophy textbook.  <br/>

      What is Cornelius gesturing to Teodor?  Is this gesture supposed to make up for the fact that, as far as Cornelius knows, he is waking Teodor up again? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, the "Faq" aspect of the "Help and Faq" link should be in all caps, because with the underline, it looks like "Help and Fag."  I was interested in both until I clicked, when I realized my error.

      I don't know...wikipedia knows everything, and they say the gesture must be palm-toward-gesture-giver to be offensive.  Cornelius's palm is not facing away from Teodor. <br/>

      Palm-inward is offensive, derived from a battleground taunt done by archers who had all but their drawing-fingers removed. Palm-outward is a friendly gesture, popularised by hippies and still used today by Japanese people posing for photographs.

      I think it is supposed to be facing away from Teodor, but Onstad just sort of sucks at perspective.  If the scene were actually rendered in three dimensions as-is, Connie would be directing his ire at that dandelion off in the distance.  Perhaps he is.

      The Wooden Driver: when, although you didn't really like all of the Pirates of the Carribean movies but watched them all anyway, and that Commodore dude turned into a pirate for a short time and used his wooden leg to finally peg Kiera Knightly in that edited-out scene that she's not so proud of but had to fight like a mungrel dog to have left off the DVD extras disc, the same fight that you donated some money to in order for the scene to fall into your hands oh god the shame of it, but she really is intensely hot if entirely without personality.

      I like to imagine you shouting this as you stand in the pouring rain outside the Achewood mansion, shaking your fist at the huge gold rotating statue of Onstad. A security guard with a badge and cap tells you to move on. You weave your way off into the night, pulling intermittently from a three liter bottle of white cider. You are broken and pathetic, but strangely noble, and I esteem you for it.

Actually, they put a section of mesh under the abdominal muscle, nothing is removed.  The sedative was great!  Don't remember a thing.  Hurts like hell now, of course.  Got some nice pain pills, wheee!

      I think you have to look at that whole series as a send-up of a certain kind of restaurant and a certain kind of food journalism.  The articles are kind of supposed to suck.  But I also understand that if you don't go to those restaurants or read about them (and I don't, really) then maybe the satire is pretty pointless.

      Speaking of food journalism, last night I prepared two more recipes from  <em>The Achewood Cookbook</em> .  We had "Five Dollar Chili" (a Roast Beef recipe) with "Fool's Rice" (by Pat.)  The rice recipe is another example of something I like about the cookbook: detailed instructions for something that is often taken for granted.  The rice came out fine, and did not stick to the pot, which was Pat's main objective for the recipe.  The chili itself is simple and tasty, but takes about 3 hours to cook.  It uses stew beef, which becomes tender and piquant under the assault of extended simmering and spices, and kidney beans.  If you are one of those people who considers beans in chili an abomination, you could leave them out.  It also occurred to me that this chili recipe would probably be a good baseline for explorations into the kind of chile colorado recipes that make sweat stream down your forehead. <br/>

This diversion is brought to you by the flexible deadlines afforded by the webcomic medium.  Thank you for your attention.
