      Fractured Fairytales and anything with Boris and Natasha.  And Improbable History.  And Dudley Do-Right.  So basically everything.  Underdog was somewhat less satisfying to me, partly because UD only spoke in rhymes and his voice sounded like it was recorded through a tin can.  Bugged me.

      Hey belgand, I have a question. (I'm sorry that this doesn't pertain to anything in this, or any, thread, people.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm going to San Jose, CA this weekend, and I wondered if you knew the details or whatever on smoking laws there? I know California has some fairly stringent anti-smoking laws. So if you could impart your knowledge here that would be helpful, and I thank you in advance.

      I try to avoid San Jose as a general rule. It pretends to be a city, but it's basically a zone for suburbs to accumulate around and a place to put the airport from my understanding. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The basic rules that apply would be state-wide so far as I know: no smoking in restaurants or bars, no smoking in public/government buildings, probably no smoking in most offices (if they don't bar it already it's still kinda a dick thing to do). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Those are pretty much the rules almost anywhere in the country though. Lots of places have banned smoking in bars/restaurants. Sadly we haven't been making enough traction on the laws forbidding smoking within 20 feet of the entrance to homes. I know it was up for a while, but that was just a San Francisco ordinance. Still, don't be a dick man, if you're going to smoke don't do it right outside a building by the doors making everyone have to walk through it. Be courteous enough to move down the block and maybe into the alley if possible so people on the sidewalk (do they even have sidewalks in San Jose? Probably not. At least, not ones that go anywhere) don't have to walk through it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had people who used to smoke right outside my dorm room window back in college even though it was in clear violation of both dorm and campus-wide rules and nobody did anything about it. It is a huge thing for me and that just made it worse. Especially in the late spring before they turned the air on and it got hot enough that closing windows wasn't an option.

      Further away from the building also means less chance of it collapsing on you during an earthquake, if we're carefully weighing up risk factors.

      Okay, thanks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I usually do try to at least stand a good distance away from any entrance or exit to a building when I smoke. I try to be courteous, you know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Smoking is usually still allowed in bars here, but not restaurants unless it's an enclosed, separately-ventilated area. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hate no smoking in bars laws. Drinking immediately loses about half its fun if you can't smoke while you're imbibing.

      I love smoke-free bars and restaurants. I can't wait till my city catches up with the rest of the country and makes it mandatory. I know, I know - smoke without drink is like cock without pussy. I agree. But I hate goin' home reekin' like ten homeless ladies. Also, if I can't smoke at a bar I end up going home with about fifteen more cigarettes than I would have had otherwise, not to mention about six months added to my life. As dubious as rules like this may be in the broader sense, I appreciate this particular one in many ways. <br/>

On the other hand, anybody who tells me where I can and can't smoke  <em>OUTSIDE, IN THE OPEN FUCKING AIR</em>  can suck it.  <em>So</em>  hard. Don't even whine at me about that shit. If a brief whiff of secondhand smoke in the open air terrifies you that much, you need to reevaluate. You need help.

      I want to see an HBO 'reimagining' of the Anthill Mob and their gritty, murderous world. It looks like they've got a couple of stone killers in their ranks already. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Can't you just see the one in the yellow trenchcoat  stabbing an icepick into some hump's head over and over and  <em>over</em> ?  <br/> 
Meanwhile, the one that looks a bit like Big Pussy wears a vaguely concerned expression that probably has more to do with the thought of getting blood and brain matter on his shoes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes you can.

      Well, they did all become much more caring gangsters.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The whole Mob had their names changed and apparently underwent behaviour modification at some point between  <em>Wacky Races</em>  and  <em>Perils of Penelope Pitstop</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
They got given some shite powers as well ,I think. So it seems they received some combination of the Ludovico technique and the Captain America super-soldier program.

Anyone remember Horrible Harry (or something like that), the book series looked like it was kept in a series of Composition Notebooks?

      while i agree on this point, learning how to be a clear and concise writer doesn't necessarily require a formal education if one has talent and does loads of drafts and maybe reads a style book or two. <br/> 
something i found interesting: tarantino didn't go to college, alfred hitchcock and wes anderson didn't go for film, howard hughes, paul thomas anderson  and cameron crowe dropped out, and woody allen was expelled. <br/> 
on the other hand, you have to establish contacts in order to get noticed, and going to school is one way to do that. <br/> 
but i suggest that if you have a good idea, don't suck at writing and are charismatic enough to friend your way through hollywood, you could indeed be a successful screenwriter without a formal education. <br/> 
 <br/> 
man, i always seem like the only person my aqe who just loves the hell out of howard hughes facts and jokes.

      I have no idea what that means but I'm going to assume they studied under him OR OVER HIM HYUK HYUK but either way, I don't know because I've never seen their movies, but I've read parts of scripts (ain't reading no 200 page shit) by Hunter and am not impressed.  Especially with his hypothetical spec that he uses in "Screenwriting 434."  It's cliche's older brother that everyone in cliche's high school class knows about and cliche is always living in his shadow.  Maybe that's just because it's an example; as a script it's sufficient but as good dialogue and a good story, no.  No.

      Living in Manhattan, I've been near the movie business too many times (as attested to by the location directors that scream at me for ruining the shot). <br/> 
 <br/> 
At first, it was cool that there was a lot of location shoots in my neighborhood, but eventually it sucked that the trailers took up all the good parking spaces.

      <em>So, I tell them I'm a pro jock, and who do you think they give me? The Dalai Lama, himself. Twelfth son of the Lama. The flowing robes, the grace, bald... striking.<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm on the first tee with him. I give him the driver. He hauls off and whacks one - big hitter, the Lama - long, into a ten-thousand foot crevasse, right at the base of this glacier. Do you know what the Lama says? Gunga galunga... gunga, gunga-galunga.<br/>
<br/>
So we finish the eighteenth and he's gonna stiff me. And I say, 'Hey, Lama, hey, how about a little something, you know, for the effort, you know.' And he says, 'Oh, uh, there won't be any money, but when you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total consciousness.' So I got that goin' for me, which is nice.</em>

      Your impersonation of Kanye is mistaken.  Kanye doesn't yell.  He calmly and reasonably explains that he is the greatest musician on the planet, references the 70s, then the 80s, then the 90s, plays some Daft Punk on vinyl and then you are like: <br/>

      DMX is different variations on yelling, or Mystikal, to take you back to 10 years ago.  Kanye is more conversational, though he does ramp it up at times.  He just doesn't strike me as an all-caps kind of guy.

      You are missing out.  <em>Late Registration</em>  doesn't yell much but  <em>Graduation</em>  almost seems like he is trying to keep up with the raspy voices of Young Jeezy and Lil' Wayne.

      I just don't agree with you here.  808s is almost a soul album, albeit one with alot of autotune.  When he gets emotional, his tone goes up, sure, but it definitely isn't an all caps thing.  I don't know about his blog though.

      That is because he can't do as good a job as Oasis, at least at what they do. Jay-Z evidently cannot sing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, Oasis likely cannot rap. So, you know. Maybe they should...stick to their respective genres? <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, is there some backstory to this? Was there some kind of  <em>feud</em>  between Oasis and Jay-Z?

      Nah, but it seemed that Yoko really was good for him. I mean, the whole affair was still a dick move, but he seems like he was a slightly nicer person. I mean, around '73 or so he finally started trying to not be quite so much of a dick to Julian (though he was still enough of one to leave him out of his will).

      I have to agree even though I laughed slightly at it. I will never, ever understand the obsession that suburban white kids have with wanting to be the most disastrous, terrible ghetto bastard while actual black kids are out there behaving politely and getting accepted to good schools. <br/>

It's one of the few things I heard said here about the importance of Obama's race that actually made a lot of sense. We really need to push the stereotype that being black means that you're well-spoken and intelligent.

It went on too long and while it was an interesting concept it just didn't sell me hard enough. Also, hip-hop culture is basically the worst thing ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This would have been better if he'd trimmed it down to only two tiers and given it a better ending. With a few exceptions (GOF, Garage Sale, etc.) the multi-tier strips rarely work as well as the two-tiers. If there's enough meat there split it up a bit and really polish each bit rather than letting it get all soggy in the middle.

While not all will run Linux the remainder are guaranteed to have been "meaning to start dual-booting" for the past few years. Will understand obscure references to KITH or the State. Prefers Voyager. <br/>

Have seen full run of Doctor Who including lost episodes. Will appreciate references to Big Train and Twitch City (American geeks only, please consult localization manual for foreign geeks' understanding of non-domestic comedy). TOS/TNG (your choice).

At least you can do something with Java.  Comics are much more geeky. <br/> <br/> <br/> I think a nerd-date service (for RPG and other tabletop game nights, not for romance and smoochies) would be interesting though.

      I'm definitely not a full on nerd or geek. I like comics and video games fine and well but I didn't do my thesis paper on the Beckett-esque postmodernism themes in  <em>Super Mario Bros</em> , and I also didn't do that in Basic.

      Although, come to think about it,  <em>Super Mario Bros</em>  could be considered the video game equivalent to  <em>Waiting for Godot</em> . I mean, the princess was ALWAYS in another castle, and you didn't really know WHY you were doing it, just that you had to. I also hold that it is actually impossible to beat and that any end game scenes are merely Photoshopped. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Coincidentally, the only game I've ever played and found it was actually impossible to beat was the Game Boy version of Donkey Kong (the arcade game). One of the higher levels had a switch that was behind a wall that could only vanish  <em>after hitting that switch</em> . <br/>

      The most superior term for a lady to use to express derision, I am told, is "suck my bloody tampon".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It really does the job. In clinical trials 9 out of 10 subjects were suitably told. This is compared to the control group who were told an innocuous phrase by the same woman in the same manner and tone of voice. Almost none of whom reported feelings of being put in their place or a desire to say "Oh SNAP!" after seeing someone on the receiving end of the phrase.

      I didn't put it below as the giant mountain of long boxes behind me can easily attest. I just decided not to necessarily describe increasing knowledge on each topic as it went along. I mean, I did that with a few, but not all. There are so many varied geeky pursuits that to have an escalating system of describing the greater knowledge of each would be prohibitive.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Java was chosen because it's become, roughly, the new BASIC. It's the intro language for most people taking programming courses in school and just about everyone knows it. I mean, it's not C or something hard.  <br/>

Just be glad I didn't do the last one as I'd originally intended and make it entirely acronyms.

      Both Voyager and DS9 are so below my level of contempt that I cannot properly express which is worse. I tend to give Voyager at least a bit more credit for just being a crappy idea and a bad show rather than DS9 which has a lot of controversy over whether they just ripped off B5 (after JMS pitched it to them and they turned it down) and made a crappy show instead of an awesome one.

      I've read before that the best way to move things to metric is to just start labeling things in metric. Everyone in the US knows what a 2 liter bottle is, but would be hard pressed to identify a 2 quart bottle (technically 2 liters works out to 2 quarts 3.6 fl oz., but its close enough). <br/>

      The only problem I have with metric when compared to imperial (what we Canadians call imperial, which is actually US and not the British Imperial system, or whatever) is in length. Feet and inches are still way more intuitive to me than measuring things in any metric unit, let alone sticking with SI and measuring everything in metres. I suppose decimetres wouldn't be that bad, but inches and feet are just really easy to eyeball for me, and many others. Even with something like wrenches, it is easier for me to conceive of a 1/16" difference than a 1mm one. <br/> 
I would make the same argument for pounds but I think that kg would equally as easy to fathom as a pound if I had grown up with it.

      I agree that there is less motivation to switch for American, being relatively more self-contained than many places, but I guarantee you that many of your engineers have torn their hair out because they had to use a gravity constant in a place where it wasn't intuitive, because the American system wants to have a lbmass and lbweight.

      Seems more probably that they would build one 32 times as big or 32 times smaller (that's the gravity constant), but hey maybe they forgot a 2 in there as well. Forgetting to divide/times by 2 is probably the most common mistake I have made in all homework.

Except that unlike long scale, the next step up is not "trillion = million billion" (1,000,000,000,000,000,000), but trillion = ten hundred thousand million billion. (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000)

      Very true, but what bothers me more are countries where they use a comma for a decimal point rather than a period. That always screws with me. It's also loads of fun when you have a good deal of, say, German-made scientific equipment in your lab and have to deal with that every single day because  <em>everything</em>  is small enough that it's into decimals.

      I asked my girlfriend one time why someone would want their clit (MOIST) pierced and she basically said it was for aesthetic purposes. So basically it is pointless. <br/>

I would never get my junk pierced, I mean I practically cried like a baby when I got my tattoo last year, I can't even imagine a piercing gun near my kibbles and bits.

      I am curious how that is a gift to you. I mean, wouldn't it make manipulation of the nipples slightly more challenging? I thought part of the appeal, aside from the vigorously debated aesthetic one, was that the constant motion of the rings or bars tended to provide a degree of stimulation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A friend of mine whom I have seen, well, she would have been nude if someone hadn't stopped the strip poker game just a bit too early for some reason, mentioned that the reason for her own pierced nipples -- which, though I am not a fan normally, did have a nice accent that suited them nicely -- was partially because she normally did not have particularly sensitive nipples, but the piercing greatly increased her degree of pleasure from them. She was that kind of person, i.e. awesome.

      It keeps them in a semi-hard state, so they are more sensitive. Also, and she would kill me for saying this probably, but she had had them pierced before we met but had to take them out when she had knee surgery and it made her nipples flat, almost inverting into her breasts. Now they actually have texture. <br/>

      The few women that I've 'known' that had pierced hoods found that by walking a certain way, they could create great pleasure.  It's not a 'get off by funny-walking' sort of thing.  But they could get mad horny by moving the right way.  I'm told it can be very neat the first few weeks, when it kinda sneaks up on you and suddenly you are achingly horny during pilates or whatever women do when I'm not hitting that

      If you think that is a "shocker" you know nothing of sex toys or women. I can't quite tell at this resolution, but that looks a bit like one of the platypus models. Essentially all are a rip-off of the "Rabit Pearl" (or the more powerful "Rabit Habit") that became ludicrously popular due to being featured in Sex and the City (or so I am told). Essentially it is a multi-function vibrator that both vibrates, has a rotating shaft, and has an attachment (often an animal shape) that remains outside of the vagina and stimulates the clitoris by moving very rapidly like a hummingbird. The pearl model expanded on this already popular idea by also adding a series of small "pearls" inside the lower part of the shaft that twirl and rotate to stimulate ladies at some of their most sensitive areas. The curve, again an incredibly common feature in many, many devices, is to aid stimulation of the g-spot which is totally not a myth and really does work on some ladies, but not necessarily all of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If it was an anal attachment it would be on the other side. I believe you  <em>can</em>  use it for anal stimulation, but it's tricky and you're best off getting a model specifically designed for such things.

      The key thing is not to compete with the sex toys.  If you play their game, you will lose.  You do not cause orgasms that are as strong as a six-prong chimaera.  You are more visually pleasing (well, maybe not YOU, but men in general).  Also, a vibrator will never tell a woman to call you Barack during sex.  They fucking love that

      They have yet to create a vibrator that can perform adequate oral sex. I say to you gentlemen again and again, this is the key. Not all ladies are always into penetration all the damn time during sex. Sometimes they just want to be catered to and have someone else do all the work like they're special as all hell. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is also, coincidentally, where the sex toys come in. You use it to help you. It's like the garlic bread of the sex world: ridiculously cheap and easy, but you can put a huge mark-up on the sucker and get all sorts of credit because it's so damn awesome.

      I have always found piercing to be kind of like an industrial accident that was never properly attended to. I will now reference an episode of  <em>Mission Hill</em>  that if you actually watched and enjoyed the series you will likely understand, but if you did not you will have no knowledge that it even exists most likely. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Messrs. Oakley and Weinstein really had something excellent going on there. It was, in many ways, a great expansion from classic-era Simpsons, much like The Critic (Messrs. Jean and Reiss, show-runners for seasons 3 and 4, while Oakley and Weinstein did 7 and 8) also was.

      It was good but it wasn't as good as this one.  I'm not gonna say PFSC is on the decline; I actually think it's been fairly consistent since I began reading and since it began.  This is my favorite one in recent weeks though: <br/>

      I think it has been on a decline because he's moved away from the original characters after the hell arc was finished. I like the hand-drawn art (even though it looks the same, it looks different) and I think he is focusing more on the "darkness-as-the-punchline" concept he worked with at the beginning of the comic.

      Well let's be honest, the hell arc went no where.  I'm disappointed he didn't explore the South American thing; you could tell he wanted to.  I liked the shift towards Gary because Paul was just too angry and non-caring at everything, but now I'd like to see them interact more.  "Darkness as the punchline" is the ONLY punchline in PFSC and when he balances it with the characters, it's the best.

      Outside of this particular cartoon, but relevant to Achewood in general, the mysterious cabal behind Assetbar recently made a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413123821/https://assetbar.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/the-golden-rule-fans-trump-ads/">blog post</a>  arguing in favor of fan-supported paid content as an alternative to ad-supported free content. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Their main thesis is that fans are less likely to censor with their dollars (by refusing to support a controversial artist) than advertisers are. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While I have a certain fondness for ad-supported online media, there's an aspect of the fan-supported approach that resonates with me: patronage of the arts.  If I lived during the renaissance and had a lot of money, I suppose I might have been a patron of some painter whose work I enjoyed.  But I live in the present day, and I don't have enough money to fully support an artist.  However, a micropatronage subscription model works for me as a consumer: spend a small sum of money on a recurring basis to support an artist.  And while I don't have any guess as to Assetbar's paid subscriber numbers, I imagine that the model can make sense for the artists as well.  If an artist can attract and retain a couple thousand micropatrons at a few dollars per month, the resulting revenue stream can enable the artist to work full-time on their content (and not just the subscriber-only content, but the free stuff as well). <br/>

      I dunno, for the amount of ads for the pay content their are on the site, I feel like Chris could put up some Project Wonderful ads and help support other artists at the same time. I mean, almost every Dumbrella Network comic links to Achewood (which is how I found this place in the first place).

      The problem with that is that people besides the patron got to see the art. I have absolutely no guaranteed income, and while I could probably spare $3 a month my parents would certainly not let me spend any money on a webcomic. I know I don't have a  <em>right</em>  to view Achewood, but still. <br/>

Also, how would you attract new readers if all of the content has to be paid for?

      I think one of the essential roles of the paying micropatron is to subsidize the creation and publication of the free content.  It's in the micropatron's best interest to enable the artist to publish a lot of free content, because the free content helps bring in more readers (which is a good thing in lots of ways). <br/> 
 <br/> 
One way to look at it is that a micropatron is paying for two things: <br/> 
1. A fraction of the fixed cost of creating the content (i.e., the supporting-the-artist aspect of patronage) <br/> 
2. The variable cost of distributing the content to themself and to a lot of people who consume the content for free (i.e., the subscriber ends up subsidizing the cost of running the website). <br/> 
 <br/> 
For a small-to-medium sized fanbase, the fixed cost is much bigger than the variable one.  As the traffic grows, the variable cost will eventually become the dominant factor, and beyond that crossover point one must worry about whether the expected value of revenue from each newly acquired reader (that is, the probability that they'll buy a premium subscription multiplied by the cost of that subscription) is sufficient to cover the incremental cost of serving cartoons to them over the Intertubes, but a glance at traffic stats on compete.com suggests that Achewood is probably at least an order of magnitude away from that crossover point. <br/>

 <em>Lie Bot, what is the saddest thing?<br/>
<br/>
A man works too many hours at an Internet job.  He can't sleep, because he dreams of giant, apocalyptic computers mowing everyone down.  So he reads a cartoon about irreverent cats to take his mind off his work.  But the people on the cartoon forum, they make him reverse engineer the cartoon's synergistic Web 2.0 business plan.  He hears a horrible grinding noise approaching behind him.  He doesn't bother to turn around and look.  He knows that the computers have caught up with him.  And they are angry, very angry.  That, Philippe, is the saddest thing.</em>

      I don't entirely agree with this blog post. They have a point, to an extent. What they say about advertisers effectively owning content holds true for, say, television and magazines. Doesn't seem to be quite so true for the internet, for two reasons: <br/> 
1. Internet advertising on webcomics tend to come from smaller companies that aren't quite so concerned with their "public image" or whatever, or from Project Wonderful, which is generally other webcomics. <br/> 
2. Given the unique nature of the internet, and webcomics in particular, the producers of content seem to have much more say over their material than advertisers do. An advertiser can say "hey you can't put that in your comic it will make us look bad" but the webcomic artist says "but if I don't put things like that in my comic no one will come to the site anymore and no one will see your ad. This what the viewers want to read." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Companies advertising on television have a unique advantage: people will watch television (and therefore, watch the ads)  <em>even if there's nothing on that they want to watch.</em>  This does not hold for the internet. I don't go to websites I don't want to read. We have to seek these things out. Content providers have to make us want to come to their site, and advertisers know this. An advertiser trying to exert control over the content of a website risks losing their audience to a much greater extent than they do on other media. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, Penny Arcade never has any problems generating ad revenue and their comic drops f-bombs every other panel and makes jokes about terrorists killing babies. But I don't see any video game companies pulling their ads saying "Penny Arcade does not reflect the values we want our company to portray." <br/> 
 <br/> 
The sort of problem that blog post is talking about tends to relate mostly to large corporations like, as the post mentioned, Kelloggs and Procter and Gamble. And I don't think any companies of that size are going to want to pay for ads on Achewood regardless of its content--Achewood has a lot of readers, but not nearly enough that someone that big would want to run ads here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hope that made sense. I'm extremely exhausted; I barely got any sleep last night.

      In the case of online advertising: unless you have huge traffic and/or an especially valuable reader demographic, you'll often have to use an ad network.  Those are mostly big corporations that are serving ads on behalf of thousands of clients, the best-paying of whom will want to exclude your offensive and/or unknown brand from the list of sites where they're willing to let their brand be advertised.  But don't worry, those ad networks have plenty of less judgmental clients who'd love to put their 'click the dancing monkey to win an iPod (if you'll just give us your credit card number)' ads on your site.  Once you get big enough, you'll have more leverage: Penny Arcade have the luxury of rejecting advertisers whose products they don't personally like.  But most online content creators don't have that option.

      Yeah, it really has more to do with the degree of popularity you have than the fact that the internet has a different dynamic than television. A popular television show can also demand a lot of money from advertisers. And advertisers also research who watches a given TV show and whether the ad time they're buying will be a good investment or not. The whole "I don't want to tarnish my image" school of advertising is barely even relevant any more. Not even with sports...Kellogg's is widely looking like a douchebag among many for pulling out of the Michael Phelps business because of his marijuana use.

      A friend of mine and I were discussing the amount of money we've both spent on Achewood merch in the past few years, and it went into the hundreds of dollars. Yet I don't see myself subscribing to a paid service for a variety of reasons, including the fact that I am extremely poor. Why doesn't Chris keep it free and develop more merch? We all know if he consistently offered shirts and Achewood tchotchkes, we'd buy them. And we'd get something concrete with our money that would still advertise the comic.

      There is an odd thought I just had.  I wonder if he could allow someone to sponsor others.  Many of you are poor, and cool.  I am rich, and lame.  If there was a clean way I could cover a few of the better people here, I would be willing to do it.  I remember when three bucks was actual money.  I once yelled at a grocery store manager for almost an hour because the cashier shorted me 5.  I now do not consider three dollars money.  I would not bend over to pick it off the ground.  If there was a way to do this, without, you know, giving away my Paypal info or credit card, I could be into this.  I imagine some other awesome people here would too.

      I try to avoid taking the bus because it would cost me $1.50. I once walked about a mile and a half to save this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I walked about a mile up one of the largest hills in town after having walked about 5 miles around town and desperately needing to get to a bathroom for the past two hours or so after having eaten seafood. This was because the cable car (of which I ended up walking the entire length route) was $5.

      It makes sense... almost like an Amazon wish list, but with the only item being amazing Achewood goodness. If Onstad had a suggestion box, I would put this in there.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But unfortunately, three dollars is two or three meals for me. Being a writer means developing an affinity for nachos and chicken noodle soup. When I buy shirts or whatever else, I can at least rationalize it by telling myself that I'm buying durable apparel which will reflect my Achewood love for years to come. I'm very good at explaining things to myself in a way that allows me to do what I was already planning on doing...

      Man, I am feeling like there should be a parallel service for women. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like some chick shows up and you play truth or dare only niether of you dares each other anything and she just listens to you talk about your personal problems and then she says "Wow you are really strong." Then you both eat ice cream and discuss menstruation, but she eats just a little more than you so you don't feel self-conscious. She's also just slightly more chubby than the customer, but still pleasant to look at. 100% refund for inspiring vague feelings of jealousy. <br/> <br/> <br/> I'm a girl so I can say this and it's not sexist.

      Sadly, I'm not the best for beer.  I like the stuff, but I have trouble getting up in arms about it.  I'm more into arguing about wine or the hard stuff.  Any beer you see at a frat party should probably be taken off the 'palatable list'.  Other than that, it is different person to person.  If you ask me, cpnglxynchos looks like a Babycham man.

      Guinness would not be a good choice for a new beer drinker. but for the record, it's NOT a heavy beer. here it (G) is compared to COORS LIGHT (C): <br/> 
 <br/> 
calories  <br/> 
C 105 <br/> 
G 125 <br/> 
 <br/> 
carbs <br/> 
C 5 <br/> 
G 10 <br/> 
 <br/> 
alcohol content <br/> 
C 4.2% <br/> 
G 4.0% (as high as 4.2%) <br/> 
 <br/> 
and that is Guinness DRAFT, not Guinness XXX Stout (or one of several other variants not available in the United States). <br/> 
 <br/> 
overall, beer itself is considered an acquired taste with a a not so subtle side affect (drunkennes). like coffee is a an acquired taste with a not so subtle side affect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
to me Guinness is creamy dreamy elixir that flows smoothly down the gullet, i can pound a lot of it and get a consistent side affect from it. i know my exact limits on it and don't get appreciable hangovers (the worst side affect). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Guinness does not taste like beer to me. when i am in the mood for a BEER, i get a Coors Light or a hoppy IPA that is 7  % alcohol. <br/> 
 <br/> 
drink responsibly.

      I think I may have had my last Mickey's, and it makes me kind of melancholy.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
A lot has been written about the realization that you have made love to a person for the last time.  You usually don't realize it at the time, only later, and then you look back on it with a greater fondness but also a sadness that you didn't cherish it more.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can't remember with any certainty the  <em>last</em>  time I drank a Mickey's, but I do have a lot of fond memories of emptying those little green bottles and staring at those rebus puzzles.  It's just that now I can't imagine a reasonable scenario where I would be drinking Mickey's again.  I'm at an age where my friends and I actually want to enjoy the taste of our beer, and we're not the types to buy a case of Mickey's to drink ironically.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, I could go pick up a six pack of Mickey's just for old times' sake.  But that kind of a beer booty-call would just make me feel cheap and unfulfilled.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, unless there's a backyard BBQ where I find you are the last beer at the bottom of the cooler, goodbye Mickey's.  Thanks for challenging my intellect even while you were eroding it.  I'll treasure all those nights I wrapped my lips around your extra-wide barn door.

      In these economic times, your friendly Midwestern homeboy recommends 40s of Old Milwaukee.  Cheaper than Mickey's AND it's not malt liquor.  Either that or a four-pack of Miller/High Life tall-boys.   <br/>

      You know, that is one point that always got me. I imagine he wore a shirt when he changed shorts, because they only said he could never be NUDE, but they never specified where he had to wear clothing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, the fact that the incredibly close up and almost unrecognizable shot of his junk scared him back into being a never-nude, but he was going to be completely naked as Frightened Inmate Number Two, and people would see his face.

      Do not even begin to question the continuity errors in AD; I am startled by the amount of them when I think about them.  For example "The One Where Michael Leaves" says they left for Phoenix then returns 3 days later, but then it says Lindsay and Tobias spent "one night in the bedroom."  It is a slippery slope.  Just accept it.

      I think what makes the show so awesome is that it obviously has little regard for the plot (considering that they wrapped it up in the single most ridiculous way ever) and by the time season 3 came around they were READY to be cancelled. I am convinced the whole thing was a marketing stunt on the part of FOX and Ron Howard because by the end of season 2 you could tell they didn't give a shit anymore and just produced some of the weirdest (and awesomest) situation comedy of the post-9/11 generation. By the time they threw in Charlize Theron you knew that shit just got real. <br/> 
 <br/> 
AD doesn't age that well, but it makes me really wish I started watching it when it was on TV and when the jokes would have actually been relevant.

      But you're not going to love it! I can almost guarantee that Arrested Development will not work in movie form. It was too perfectly suited to episodic format. Plus, what the hell are they going to do in a two-hour movie, anyway? They already wrapped up the plot. There's nothing left.

      The George-Michael/Maeby saga remains open-ended.  Also if they added 3 intermissions, it would work so hard.  Also  do you really honestly think it will completely fail because it's 2 hours instead of 30 minutes?  You do realize they had season-long plots that worked quite well.

      My point is not that it being longer than an episode is the problem. My point is that there were a lot of jokes that became funnier because they either became running gags for weeks on end or because they took weeks to set up. You don't have that same liberty in a two-hour movie. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I've made a huge mistake" is funnier when you hear it for the fifth time, and it's been like seven weeks since they first said it. Not that funny if you hear it for the fifth time and the first time they said it was an hour ago. This is just an example.

      Restraint will solve that by limiting lines like that to twice with a slight variation the second time around or something.  I wouldn't expect writers as good as Mitch & Co. to throw same amount of references into 2 hours that worked over 3 years.

      They wrapped up (kinda) the plot and such with Futurama's last episode and despite only the first movie being any good I'm still glad they made all of them. I'd love to have new episodes too (I think the longer format was partially to blame).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Same goes for  <em>Serenity</em>  which did bad things to favorite characters, horribly compressed longer story arcs, still left things out, and gave us an a crazy plot about Reapers that I still hate very, very much. Apparently there will be a comic to explain Book's background. <br/>

      Well, it felt like they wrapped things up enough to end on a really good note if it was going to be the last episode (as they suspected), but also let them continue on if they got the chance. I think it did a hell of a lot better job ending it then the end of  <em>Into the Wild Green Yonder</em>  which felt really rushed and mediocre at the end and, well, the whole thing felt disconnected and not great.

      I disagree. It just felt like a clip-show of D&D related moments that most of us already noticed because they were blindingly obvious if you'd be even remotely prepared to understand them. It felt forced. <br/>

I wanted more out of the maths lecture on  <em>Bender's Big Score</em> , but it too more or less disappointed me. There were some good moments in it, but it was a tad too short. I do not like maths, but I wanted more of it.

      It's complicated. The court had struck down a previous law banning same-sex marriage. That's why the amendment was even put forward. The claim is that the amendment, by taking away rights granted to a minority by the courts is making a fundamental change in the state constitution. Basically that it's too big of a change to the constitution to only be made by an amendment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's complicated and tricky, but in the end it's kinda about the fact that when it comes to the preservation of minority rights when you let something like this happen, especially with only a simple majority, you're getting a tyranny of the majority situation rather than protecting the rights of everyone. <br/>

      The end of the first season kills me with the Atkin's references, but produced one of the funniest Gob lines ever.  "What about macaroni--let me finish--salad?"  But yes, it won't age well if you look at scenes like George Sr. in the spider-hole as Saddam, the Buster/Terry Schaivo parallels, Scared Straight, Humvee vs. Popemobile ("Glad I didn't take the Humvee") etc.  But the humor is, as you said, completely irreverent towards the plot (yes I meant irreverent) and it got crazy self-aware at points ("S.O.B.s"), which is always funny, and at least for now, it's hilarious from start to finish.

That actually might be the most lasting one.  Or the Charlie Brown references just because we know they've already lasted this long.  Things like Charlize Theron in "Monster's Ball" might not. <br/>

      S.O.B's was intended to be self-referential, and what makes it even better is it was written after the decision to cancel the show was made, so at that point it was pointless to Save Our Bluths. <br/>

      While I enjoyed that it still required a bit of extra explaining to people who weren't fans and weren't following the show's fortunes at the time. The various jokes (also, the season two joke about the order decrease) just don't play as well without some sort of commentary (and their commentary often sucks) or trivia track or such. In the future we'll need to get, well, a better commentary track. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm spoiled though, despite the excellent film tracks the Simpsons DVDs have great commentaries. I often end up watching them more than the episodes. Again and again and again.

      Ah, where would I be without DVD commentaries.  "Anchorman" and "Talladega Nights", while not exactly classic cinema (and what with TN being downright bad) have the best commentaries ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But anyway, I think the effort put into trying to get those inside jokes only makes you enjoy the show even more.  Not to say that a casual viewer should have to WORK to find it funny, but then again this show hardly caters to a "casual viewer" of any kind ever (see: foreshadowing Buster's hand). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also I just thought of this today in Anthropology: where the hell are George-Michael's other grandparents?  Did they just ignore their grandson after their daughter died?  Or were they dead?  Or did they die when she did (even though she was in a coma)?  QUESTIONS.

 <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Riding high on the success of "The Great Outdoor Fight", Achewood and Dark Horse Comics have compiled an extensively annotated collection of the first few years' worth of "Achewood" comics. This is no mere companion volume to the cult-classic online strip: the entire prehistory of Achewood is set forth for the first time, and all of the celebrated alt-texts are included. Additionally, author Chris Onstad has literally littered the book with observations and rudities. "Time" magazine named back-to-back Ignatz Award-winner "Achewood" its 2007 Graphic Novel of the Year, and legions of devoted fans consistently report that it makes them feel the way Bloom County and Calvin and Hobbes did when they were young.</em></div> <br/>

Then Zack Snyder makes the  <em>Great Outdoor Fight</em>  movie and he uses slow-mo so he can pretend to reproduce every comic panel on the screen and there's hard rock music that pretty much has nothing to do with the place or time the story is set in and adds in a bunch of extra sex scenes and also changes the ending and a bunch of arrogant frat boys who don't read comics talk like a bitch and act like they know / just straight turned art into a burlesque show // Got in one gash that was tight and your girl got scared / Said "I hope your big mandingdong came prepared" / I said "I wrap it up like it don't need any air / Now back your fat ass up and look over there."

      For  <em>300</em>  he added the crazy, disturbingly pro-Bush stuff happening back in Sparta with his wife. Which, of course, also added in some extra sex. I mean, the other stuff that people complained about was always in the comic and he kept the main plot and composition pretty accurate, but he still fucked with it. Dude doesn't know how not to fuck with things or to make a movie that isn't just an adaptation of something someone else has already done with all the visual work done for him as well.

      I can't comment on that because I haven't actually SEEN  <em>300</em> , but I did see his remake of  <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>  and while I traded it back in to the store I bought it at I wouldn't say it was HORRIBLE. It just wasn't  <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just have some faith in his adaptation of  <em>Watchmen</em> , despite the fact that it is sitting at a near 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Most of the people who are giving it bad reviews either aren't familiar with the source material, aren't familiar with the source material and are trying to act like they are, or are overly familiar with the source material and wouldn't ever ever be able to review the movie on its own merits.

      Yeah, most of the negative reviews I've seen are just people who dislike the source material. It's nothing about the movie so much that they dislike the plot or dialogue or characters. If you already like them it's kind of not a good review. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh and why in the damn hell did you buy  <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> ? Just to have to return it for a huge loss. Never heard about renting? Or how about just not seeing terrible remakes of classic films. Stop being the enemy and encouraging these remakes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm thinking I might see  <em>Watchmen</em>  this weekend, ideally in IMAX if it's not amazingly sold out. The only possible hitch is that my girlfriend is re-reading it right now in the sense that it is sitting on the table and not getting read very much.

      It was 3 bucks, so it might as well have been a rental. <br/>

I'm going tomorrow after class, not in IMAX because I'm broke, but I gave my girlfriend the book for Valentine's Day and she just finished it, and loved it. She caught shit I didn't even catch.

      i think he's referring to all the palace intrigue in sparta, the effeminate pro-democratic faction, the portrayal of the primacy of the leader who undermines the constitution to "save it," and the tacit approval of neo-con ideology that seems to imply. but i could be wrong, i haven't seen the movie since it was released.

      the best thing about seeing that movie was that i was sitting next to a middle-aged hippy who kept standing up and seig-heiling every time the spartans did their hoo-rahs. i started doing it too and he bought me some m&m's.
