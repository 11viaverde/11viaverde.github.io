      To be fair, Justin Timberlake probably had very little to do with how that song sounds. You can blame his legion of producers with their army of Pro Tools plugins. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Like Waves Autotune! That plugin is the  <em>bomb</em> . It's either proof of the existence or non-existence of God, depending on which way you look at it.)

      The Autotune has become a travesty at this point because some singers have made their entire living on it and nobody even knows it because its done with an expert touch to correct the fact that they can't hit near as many notes as it appears. I think it's a useful tool only so long as it smooths a rough edge here and there, not as a crutch to make a bad singer good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The second part of the travesty is that some rappers/singers/whatever have made their living off the Autotune and everybody knows this because they crank that bitch up and sound like a sexxxed up robot human on every song.

      The autotune is making it even easier (not that it is ever hard) to make shitloads of money in the music industry off of someone who can't actually make music and is only a vehicle to sell an aesthetic. Are you good looking? Check. Will you wear/say/do what we tell you? Check. Can we afford expensive producers to use their magic hit formula on your heavily subsidized voice? Check. <br/>

We have a star.

      Dudes, you are WRONG about autotune.  What stupid idiot doesn't know there is some weird effect when it blips from one note to the other?  It isn't trying to trick people, it's trying to sound cool.  If you think it sounds dumb, that is your prerogative, but come on, give pop music producers some credit for taking what was invented as a tuner and turning it into basically a digital vocoder-type effect.  Plus, god damnit rowboat, I like that Cher song.  I DO believe in love after love after love after lover after love.

      Listen mattylite, would you consider that "artists" like Rhianna and Britney Spears and Katy Perry are good singers? Becauses they appear to hit every note? The average person doesn't know it because it's subtle, but they've been propped up by the autotune. All three, and many more, were chosen for an aesthetic and all three would horrify your eardrums both on album and on stage if they didn't have the autotune to make them amazing. That's what I hate about the first category of "autotunists." If you autotune all your album work, and then lip sync all your concerts so you can dance better, you don't make music in my book. You are just a tool. An example of two singers that I don't like but respect just a little bit more than the rest of the pack are Pink and Christina Aguilera. No doubt in my mind that they are autotune free when you hear them strain for that high note, but that little bit of grit you hear is humanity, bro. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for the second group of autotunists who blatantly use the effect because people think it sounds cool, I would remind the world of the story of little Peter Frampton. He amazed the world with an effect that could be purchased for a hundred bucks at any guitar shop called the talkbox, and made his guitar sing. Sounds pretty cool, adds just a little something to those solos. But just like a lot of artists today and the autotune, Peter Frampton has become defined by his neat little effect. And when it began to wear thin and get old, his career went nowhere. Can anyone here name a song that's not on  <em>Frampton Comes Alive!</em>  by poor Petey? Probably not. And that's why he's doing Geico commercials with his sad little talk box hooked up to his guitar. Cute little effects have a limited shelf life, and I can't wait till the world gets its fucking act together.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
For Christ's sake, at least a vocoder requires you to play the notes you are singing on a keyboard as you sing them. <br/>

      Oh man, Peter Frampton in those geico commercials.  That is sad sad sad.  I know nobody ever says this on the internet, but: Ok, you have convinced me, I will stop arguing now.  I don't think those people are artists and I don't think they can sing good without it.  But still, I do like Justin Timberlake.  And that Cher song.  And my favorite autotune use ever in that "California... likes to party" song by Zapp and Roger or whatever they were called.

      Oh, and I'm pretty sure that song you mentioned is called California Love and is by 2Pac and features Zapp and Roger using a talkbox. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A lesson may be in order: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Talk Box: A little speaker that plays whatever notes you play on your instrument (guitar, keyboard, bass, whatever) through a little tube that you run up your vocal mike and into your mouth. The sound reverberates around in your mouth and is shaped by moving your mouth like you are talking or singing and then it bounces out into the microphone.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413125135/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9D-kUEp03c">Example: Poor ole Petey</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Vocoder: This effect runs your vocals through the microphone and into hardware that forces them to take on the timbre and pitch of whatever notes you are playing at the same time. Requires, like the talk box, the ability to talk and play your instrument with good timing at the same time, but not necessarily sing. Examples:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413125135/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SvZrL075SI&amp;feature=related">USE</a>  or  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413125135/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAK_jtOf70g">everyone's favorite, Daft Punk</a> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Autotune: This is a software effect that forces your voice to conform to half note steps (or whatever interval chosen), therefore not allowing you to go out of tune. One has to actually sing, and at least approach the proper note, and when it the voice crosses a certain threshold between two notes, it is forced from the previous pitch to the next. The effect can be subtle, or it can be overbearing. Example: I chose  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413125135/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcAnVZ3PUa0&amp;feature=related">Kanye West</a>  here because he is the epitome of a bad singer using the autotune to pretend he can sing. He is  <em>so bad</em>  that he can't even get close enough to some notes that he's within a halfnote, and therefore forced up to the next pitch.

      Funny that you mentioned Kanye West.  He was on SNL last weekend as the musical guest [I was watching for Hugh Laurie, not Mr West], and the girl and I noted that Kanye put on one of the absolute *worst* live performances we've ever seen from an artist.  Without his little bag of tricks, his voice strained just to stay on key even in simple midrange notes.  He sounded like a hamster caught in a wood chipper anytime he had to work to hit a higher note.  My throat hurt just from listening.

      Kanye is a fair to middling rapper, and truly CAN NOT sing. What he is really, is a performer, and an excellent crafter of songs. Songs that I often dislike. But his new route is putting a lot of strain on his posturing as being an amazing artist. I think people are starting to see through the act. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also totally think they shouldn't have forced Hugh Laurie to be an american for most of the sketches. What the fuck was that?

      Hmm... though I am familiar previous-style with Autotune would it perhaps be useful to make Rock Band played with people who think they can sing, but cannot and do not, sadly, let this keep them from trying much more bearable? Could this be killer app to make karaoke not torturous (is not possible, will always be so, is fundamental nature of concept)?

      True, but he was the best actor of the bunch in "Homerpalooza". God, now I can't stop thinking of that awesome Sonic Youth closing theme. Damn was that great. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I generally don't get bothered by it too much because I don't listen to the sort of crap pop music that autotune is commonly used in. I mean, I'm stridently against it, of course, but I never have to hear it so it's not really a big issue. The music would suck even without autotune and the singers suck even with it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Come back when you've got a band, decent songs, and write your own music. If you're just a "singer" you can fluff my hogg. Actually, no, please don't. You're probably riddled with disease and most of those people are virulently unattractive to me.

      Well I like some kinds of indie rock, in their time and place, but to completely hipsterify yourself is just the exact opposite of what you think you're doing to yourself, which is extremely ironic, and considering how much hipsters think they love irony, is one of the most dangerous kinds of irony.  Also, all the girls are the same person and dialogue is not musing on purple elephants eating you for 4 panels.

      I'm not sure I follow. Autotuner is an instrument, a way to manipulate/create sound. Choice of instrument does not determine whether a musician is quality. <br/> 
 <br/> 
...On another note :) I don't think it's right to blame autotuner for the failings of Peter Frampton. It's up to the artist to reinvent their style and stay fresh. He seems tired. <br/>

No one takes pop music seriously anyhow.

      Y'all surely don't. The autotune is an aid to make using another instrument easier. You'd find it pretty shitty if the guitarist of a band attached a little machine to the neck of guitar that let him play any chord with just one finger.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And where did you get that I blamed the autotune for frampton's failings? I blamed a different effect, the talk box, and his overuse of it as a gimick for his pretty sad little career despite having just about the best selling live album ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And finally, if people took pop music a little more seriously as a reflection of what is desirable to the largest amount of our society possible, then maybe it would have to be more intelligent.

      I think pop music is perfectly reflective of just how vapid and dumb the majority of our population (and likely the rest of the world based on their terrible pop music, no need to single out American stupidity alone) really is. We live in a society where people really don't give a shit about someone using autotune to fake-sing or having no real musical ability and performing absolutely horrible music. This isn't just music either. It's shown to be true in television, film, and often even in the most popular books.

I think that it's the fault of marketing, not the availability of instruments (or devices) which help people cheat. The market's a place where people try to get the most for as little effort possible. It may be disgusting because it overshadows true talent, but the market is something that is inevitable with the structure of most of modern society. <br/>

Maybe, I was wrong when I said no one takes pop music seriously. People who mean to profit do. It's sad that people with actual merit so often struggle to make ends meet. Pop music is a strategy not art. It's frustrating.

      Frankly I like TMBG's usage of it on "Bastard Wants to Hit Me". I think it really worked for the aesthetic and tone of the song. <br/>

I also want to think that they used it on "Man, It's So Loud In Here". Of course, that use would have been largely satirical if it did occur which I'm thinking it probably didn't.

      I kind of feel as though not a lot of people will have heard this, but my favorite use of autotune to date would have to be "Pretty Girls" from Puerto Muerto's  <em>Elena.</em>  It's nice because Christa Meyer's voice is beyond reproach as it is, so the effects just sort of add a really interesting highlight. So I guess I like autotune best when it isn't used for cheating, basically.

Nope - that's only when you push the note transition to.. well, basically 0. Anything under 15ms is audible. Of course there are singers - and producers - so bad that you can still hear the autotune even when it's not intentional. But for the most part, no, you will never hear it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've used it to some degree on pretty much every track I've mixed (not a lot, like 15, but still) and no artist has ever picked it. These are cheap recordings, after all, maybe four or six hour sessions, there isn't enough time to get perfect takes. So, yeah, you won't hear the autotune unless the engineer or producer wants you to.

      I can't remember what site it was now, but they highlighted a number of samples where you could most definitely hear a very subtle effect that was used in such a way that I sincerely doubt it was at all intended to be heard. Major, popular type stuff.

      So many people do not understand this, and I'm glad to see that I explained the autotune somewhat correctly, though I probably should have said "half steps" instead of half notes or whatever. I don't have an actual plugin, but I would love to play around with it. If you know of a free one that is compatible with Abelton Live you should tell me.

      Jesus, that seems fraught with possibility for terror. In the plugin version, it's pre-processing (not an insert) so you can fix its little problems... which there are a lot of, believe me. Autotuning an entire vocal track takes at least a few hours, especially if they are not very good or use a lot of vibrato, because that wavering suddenly translates into massive note jumps.

Snogging is such an excellent word. It is vaguely, nonsensical, sounds a bit infantile, slightly disgusting, and is firmly onomatopoeitic. It perfectly captures the activity it describes. <br/>

      It strikes me as the equivalent of being so proud of your ancestry that you technically know little to nothing about that if you are, say, Irish you get really drunk on St. Patrick's Day, make an ass out of yourself, and try to kill the English. If you're Scottish you get drunk, paint yourself in woad, and try to kill the English. If you're Danish you get drunk, attack Essex, and accept a bribe to keep you from killing the English. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're English you get killed repeatedly by just about everyone except the Welsh. Good for you. You can beat up people who seem intent on the belief that if 'y' is going to be a vowel sometimes 'w' can be a main vowel as well. <br/>

The important take-away lesson from this is that cultural heritage mainly involves getting very drunk.

They don't like to talk about it though, I mean you hear about France surrendering but not a word about the half dozen times England did the same thing.

      Well, France did get their share of being invaded as well during those times. But they totally brought it to England and invaded the hell out of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I believe America: The Book puts it fairly well by stating that France had a great record up 'til Napoleon where they seem to have gone a bit off their game. Too much time focusing on Existentialism, fine food, and sex with even finer ladies. Wars not make one great indeed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Speaking of America there we didn't exactly  <em>lose</em>  the War of 1812, but we did get our asses seriously roughed up by Canada. Still, it was called a draw in the end so although we got pretty definitively smacked-down for our arrogance, I don't think we can say we lost it. Even though we totally did. <br/>

Side note: nobody cares that much about wars where important battles take place on the Great Lakes. This is the way of things.

      Britain has experienced its share of defeats, but invasions are a rare thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Apart from 1066 (which they're always banging on about), the only thing that could even be likened to an invasion was the installation of Willem of Orange. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, one (oft-mentioned) invasion in the last thousand years or so. What is it that the Brits don't like talking about? <br/>

Also, the US didn't start the Vietnam war, just took over from France, but still didn't manage to win.

      "America: The Book" might not be the  <em>best</em>  source of general historical larnin'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the record: the raids were in the Viking times, so pre-1066; one civil war (plus a peasants' revolt); a fair bit of domestic strife, but remarkably little compared to the mainland in the same period.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I noticed that the Brits are very big on discussing, studying and celebrating their sea-power years (ruling the waves and all that), but rarely mention of the fact that Holland was the dominant sea-power just before the British nautical golden age, nor that the plucky Dutch actually kicked the ass of the royal navy on several occasions in the 1600s.

      It is not, of course, my source material here I just feel that on occasion it phrases these things very well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will agree that the raids were definitely during the Viking era, but the rest that I mention do still have valid precedent behind them. We've got both the English Civil War, the War of the Roses, The Glorius Revolution (which was, admittedly, relatively bloodless, but still had some fighting going on),  the Wars of Scottish Independence, and The War of Irish Independence along with the Troubles. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That not even mentioning the various foreign wars and colonial issues they had such as the Opium Wars, Boer Wars, Zulu War, etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've got nothing against Britain, but the Empire certainly took it's toll on them eventually against just about everyone except the Welsh. Oh and the Scots eventually  <strike>got sold out by the nobility</strike>  decided they wanted back in

      In broad terms, Pax Romana was extended to the whole world by the Brits, giving us Pax Britannia.  Since about 1945, or 1990 if you want to be prcise, we have enjoyed Pax Americana.

      This was so not the right night to finally get around to watching Army of Shadows (Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 film about the French Resistance in WWII). Great film though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, the French totally do care. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Going back to French film, albeit more recent ones, "Tell No One" was rather good. It breaks down in the end with just a massive facial of exposition, but it's otherwise rather good and even if it becomes kinda crazy-stupid at the end I liked it. Interestingly it's a French adaption of an American novel. It also has French gangbangers in it. It's always somewhat interesting to see the worst aspects of American culture as they find purchase in other countries and mutate into strange new forms or are simply presented in a way to does not conform to our expected stereotypes of other cultures.

      I think you may be watching the wrong porn. The French ladies I tend to see are generally much more attractive than the Americans and don't look quite so much like prisoners as many Russians tend to. They lack the carefree, attractive amateur work commonly coming out of Scandinavia, but then again, so does everyone else. <br/>

      This may seem off topic but bear with me... <br/> 
Whenever we meet new people, I can always tell if my wife does not have a good first impression of them.  You see, my wife is English living here in the States with me.  Naturally when she speaks the accent gets attention.  The conversation ALWAYS goes like this: <br/> 
 <br/> 
New aquaintance: I didn't listen to a word you just said, but I LOVE your accent, where are you from? <br/> 
 <br/> 
My wife: England <br/> 
 <br/> 
New aquaintance: Oh, I'm English-Irish-German-Maltese! <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then I start listening, because if she doesn't like the person she will ask: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Oh, have you ever been to England, Ireland, Germany or Malta?" and then she will talk about a detail of the culture mentioned while watching the person squirm because they know nothing about these places that they 'are from.'   <br/> 
 <br/> 
This tells me that I can be sarcastic/slightly assholeish in the conversation without getting a look.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
You don't even want to know what happens when they respond with something like "Oh I've been to England, I was in Heathrow airport for a couple hours waiting for a plane." <br/> 
 <br/> 
We're really nice people though...honest! <br/>

      Was it not Sheffield that was used as the example for the third-world in Monty Python's Meaning of Life? I could be wrong. <br/>

      Yeah, why did I say synonym? I should have written that with some actual sleep going on or something. I totally meant euphemism. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And here I thought it originally just meant Ouzo*. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*No, actually, not really. I've just heard a lot of complaints about it. I almost went with Retsina based on the strip, but decided not to cave in to pressure and go with my original joke. The idea of an anise-flavored drink actually sounds very nice to me. It would be pleasing if there was a non-alcoholic manner of consuming such a thing, but I'm willing to bet that you need the alcohol as a solvent for the essential oils that impart the flavor and it wouldn't be possible otherwise. Sadly organic chemistry does often show me why alcohol has very valid uses in cooking and flavoring because it's just such an incredibly useful solvent for the majority of flavors. If only it was actually safe to imbibe.

      Well feel free to use it in cooking because of the low boiling point. I don't know why you wouldn't, particularly with wine. I have a mormon friend and she is ok with the use of booze in cooking because (except for some desserts) the alcohol is cooked off leaving only deliciousness.

      No, I do not cook with alcohol either. For one the alcohol is not entirely cooked off, second I do not want to spend the money purchasing something that would see only very occasional use in rather small quantities and, at least with wine and such, would not last very long after that, especially considering how expensive alcohol is, third I don't want alcohol flavors in my food, and fourth I'm completely opposed to alcohol. I wish to banish it from all aspects of life. This is not something that will occur and I'm not going to be a dick about it to others, but I'm certainly not going to cook with it. No alcohol, in any way, ever.

      I thought that was Turkey and the... hmm... can we still call them Newly Independent States these days? All the former USSR member states that broke away, plus Russia itself. <br/>

I'm told that England has a serious problem with that. I'm also told that we have a problem with it up here as well, but we just get SE Asian sex slaves (and not the kind who are into being sex slaves for their own pleasure, but the other not at all into it kind) instead of Eastern European. Seems a bit odd though. I mean, aren't we reasonably close to Russia? Why none for us? Too much competition with the present Asian massage parlor industry?

      We're not very close to Russia, unless you're Sarah Palin. Also, there's that whole ocean thing in between. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Former USSR sex slaves usually get smuggled to other European countries because they're close and because prostitution is legal in many of them, making it easier to operate. If you've ever seen the movie Lilya 4ever, it is a pretty accurate depiction of this - a Russian girl living in an impoverished part of Estonia lured into coming to Sweden with the promise of work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is also a big market for Russian prostitutes in South Korea, because apparently Asian men have a fetish for stereotypically Western-looking blondes. A friend of mine who is Swedish, blonde, and rather attractive is over there teaching and regularly gets harassed by guys asking if she is Russian, which is synonymous with prostitute. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for the southeast Asian trade, I think they would stand out and draw more suspicion in Europe, whereas in America they blend in with the general immigrant population.

      Assuming Ray is being truthful about its provenance, the meat is almost certainly highly toxic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The meat is in a ziploc bag. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Ray has brought toxic meat to the table in a ziploc bag.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
This fill me with trepidation.  This leaves me nonplussed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As clueless as Ray usually is, this surpasses even his extreme behavior. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is it all a gimmick?  Does he have  <em>something else planned?[/i}<br/>
<br/>
Given Ray's resolution of the situation between Nolan and Philippe, I can see where that may be the case.<br/>
<br/>
But also, given the [i]pulling it out of his ass</em>  nature of his conversation with Vlad, I don't really see room for a thoughtful denouement. <br/>

      But did he have that plan before they arrived?  Before Vlad arrived? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am not saying that is not the case, but it seems to rely on things that happened  <em>after</em>  the various arrivals.  And he had that food in the ziploc bag for five days.

      I would not be impressed. He is attempting a trendy, overwrought method of cooking something because he probably read about it in some glossy food-porn magazine aimed at the sort of person who considers themself a "foodie". <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's a sign of attempted pretension more than a desire to just make the most delicious meal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, while I've never attempted (and likely never will) it myself is it really that complicated once you get down to it? Just cryo-vac the meat, set the circulator to 140 F, and drop it in for about two hours. Pull it out, give it a fast sear with the blowtorch and you're done.

      These broad, dissatisfaction based criticisms of the strip have been going on for a while now, and several posters have attempted to classify their lack of enthusiasm in the strip as a downturn in quality. In response, it seems an equally large contingent thrusts forth the argument of %u201CThis is not your strip, it is Onstad%u2019s strip%u201D and expects that to be satisfactory. It is the classic Overzealous Critic vs. Overzealous Fanboy argument, though I don%u2019t think either do justice to the real problem of criticizing what is, in many ways, (I hope) a work in progress. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The fundamental difference between comic strips and most forms of writing (and for the purposes of this post, I will include many things under the tent of writing: novels, photography, painting, music, poetry, non-fiction, television, film, etc.) is, of course, its serial nature. We view Achewood as both a work in progress and a collection as a whole. Arcs, like the Great Outdoor Fight or Roast Beef in Heaven, are viewed as both through their narrative complexion and their individual instances. In the most rewarding moments, the outright silliness of a strip%u2019s concept shines through in service to the narrative, sort of a parallel goodness. I mean by this that the strip%u2019s moment runs parallel to the larger narrative of an individual arc. I am thinking here chiefly of the great strips of the GOF but also of Ray Gets Sort of Stoned or even The Math, though that was a culmination to some extent, rather than a parallel strip.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But there are also strips that are singular successes, the Comic Sans beating, or the Mountain and the Motorcycle, though truly, part of the success of these is the flashes of character against the specific story of each strip, a different sort of parallel success. In the Mountain and the Motorcycle, it is Ray%u2019s boredom and creative, infantile humor that shows its presence. His character reverberates in the reader, as each of us has had moments of such completely ridiculous pleasure. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now that Cornelius is at the fore of the narrative, there is an evolution of sorts in his character. In the past, he has been one of my favorites. Connie was the gentle, worldly bartender at the Dude and Catastrophe, and the brilliant, underappreciated genius who worked for the Spice channel instead of sipping scotch and working longhand on a novel at his summer house. (I recall Faulkner writing second-class movie-scripts to earn an income vs. the drunk Faulkner that worked on his Mississippi farm and accepted nobel prizes) Cornelius was the quiet, graceful sort who won the badass games without breaking a sweat because he was worldly and experienced. When he made mistakes before, they were fleeting and ridiculous, like getting the Star Wars logo %u201CTattooed%u201D across his chest before we learned that it was in fact both temporary and far more preposterous. Now, though, Connie is figure with real flaws. He is a snob; he%u2019s in love with a stripper who (ostensibly) equals him in wit and class though not age; but most glaringly, he%u2019s a part of the plot. In the badass games, the jokes were not of Cornelius%u2019s success but rather of the other character%u2019s failures. Cornelius%u2019s success was obvious and proper (and funny in that class) and worked in concert with the narrative of the badass games.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
When he was duped by three strange characters inside a fancy-pants computer, I enjoyed the arc but it left a strange taste in my mouth. This was because rather than being an arc that featured Cornelius, it was an arc ABOUT Cornelius. In order to have a successful narrative, your lead needs to have flaws. Ray has too much money, Roast Beef has depression, Hamlet is indecisive, and Othello is temperamental and suffers jealousy. Cornelius is a snob. It is insufferable. Pat we like to see suffer, he%u2019s a dick and deserves dickish things. Connie is not supposed to be a snob. We don%u2019t want to see him as a snob. He should be more detached.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
This has all been said before. The argument I am trying to muster is that Achewood changes. Pat used to be one of the other cats, not too bad, until Onstad found a place for him: the contemptuous, superior heel. His alteration was painless because it was so early and happened to such a minor character. When it happens to Cornelius, it is both difficult and consciously present as he is the life of this particular Arc.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I, like many readers, took a long time to warm up to Achewood, precisely because it is so character driven, but when I did start to love it, I read the entire archives, in order, from start to finish. This was about a year ago, I suppose, and I followed the wedding Arc with a sense of community (assetbar) enthusiastic about something that has been pending for some time. After the wedding there was a sort of postpartum depression that took hold. What remained of the Molly-Beef romance tension drifted away. This arc is a brave thing, and one that comes in the midst of Onstad%u2019s GOF book tour. Each pause without a strip makes the anticipation for the next strip weighted with meaning. The new strip HAS to be better because assetbar has been waiting. I guess what I%u2019m saying is, lets not be too hasty to judge. <br/>

      No. Thats not snobbery. Thats being a curmudgeon. Nobody has ever been a snob by being too old for rap music. You're a snob if you listen to the Wu-Tang clan and think that makes you superior to your friends who listen to Kanye. You're not. You're still a white guy who still thinks your taste makes you a person on earth worthy of acclaim. <br/>

      He doesn't think he's better than him so much as he thinks that Ray's desire to do something trendy for acclaim that is beyond him has resulted in producing something that could well give his dinner guests botulism. <br/>

He would be more of a snob if, when presented with a fine home-cooked meal, he chastised Ray for it being of low ways and not quite fancy and trendy enough. Ray is trying to show off, but he can't quite do it. His hubris has led to potentially toxic meat.

      This is a good point, and exactly the problem in judging webcomics on a strip-to-strip basis. I mean, one is free to criticize as much as they want whenever they want, but I think that the best moments, for me, happen when I don't think too much about whether something is working or isn't working. Like, if I go to a movie, I wait till i'm out of the theater. I think saying "That arc wasn't as good as this arc" is great and helpful to spread opinion, but saying "Achewood is jumping the shark" while one reads a work in progress, so to speak, is silly.  <br/>

I'm not sure what you mean by denial.

      I mean that people have been saying "give him a break, this is just one arc, let's wait and see what he does next" for quite a while now.

      I hope by "for quite a while now" you mean "since this arc with the stripper started". I'm not saying it hasn't happened in the past but at least I have known a significant drop in quality since now.

      Perhaps. I don't know if he puts that much thought into his fanbase.It's not as if he's marketing energy drinks. I do think that his touring makes it difficult to come up with crazy ideas. Maybe he's sick of being surreal. Maybe HE doesn't want to make a Cartilage Head part deux.

 <br/> 
This concept kind of amuses me. Of  <em>course</em>  Onstad is marketing! There's nothing bad about it, but he is. What do you think the premium updates are for? Why does he do tours and try to keep the blogs going at all? Why does he publish Zines and do New Yorker articles? There's no reason to pretend Onstad isn't marketing; he's a man running a respectable business and there's absolutely nothing immoral about doing the sorts of things you have to do to pay the bills when you have a family. It's silly to claim that he's somehow above marketing. And though he's aiming for a different audience, yes, his consideration of his fanbase is exactly the same as marketing energy drinks. Find what your audience will buy and work hard to provide that to them. And expand your audience. It's what any working artist has to do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, Elbox: I didn't like the wedding arc. I'd say we should start a club, but personally I'd prefer to start an aklys. Just sayin'.

      I disagree. It's not the same as marketing energy drinks. In culling a fan base, I have no doubt that he considers how to make premium content in a way that will make sure a lot of people will enjoy it and want to suppor it, and yes, that is marketing. I never said it wasn't. But the difference is he doesn't have an entity dictating creative control, it's still very much an individual effort, and that is what is so commendable. I said energy drinks because they're entirely about testosterone driven marketing campaigns, the actual content of the drink is dictated by the group that the beverage company is trying to reach. Achewood is, for my thinking, an enjoyable piece of writing that isn't crafted solely for an a market because it still works as writing, and this and some other strips aside, still feel as if the artist is enjoying what he does. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think the comic is drawn so the audience will buy things. I think the comic is drawn to amuse people and that it has evolved to make money for the artist and that this is tremendous and rare. But to claim that it is an empty shell for money, I think that's off the mark. "Any working artist" is a large, large group, and I know plenty who can sell and not comprimise their work into soulless marketing.

By this phrase, I take it that you realize there are many shades and degrees of marketing, and that everyting is marketing, every smile, every compliment, every bit of clothing we put on "markets" us to the world.  Onstad is a brilliant marketer, spinning off books, T-shirts, and coming up with a premium paid service, all while keeping up the integrity of the strip.  There's nothing iinherently wrong with marketing in the largest sense of the word, but I agree that there can be venal, soulless, manipulative, exploitive marketing, like for energy drinks.

      I think this is our answer.  People really started in with the "hm, not as good as it used to be" in droves after the New Yorker stuff, then it picked up speed after the GQ/Esquire/Whatever spread.  I won't throw my hat in the ring when it comes to quality as of late (although this arc has pretty solidly blown), but that is about when I started noticing more criticism.

      I don't think it makes me a fanboy to say that he can do what he wants with the strip, I think my last "5" was an ironic 5 for being such a terrible strip. <br/> <br/> <br/> I do think this arc is going on a little long, but that's probably just the side effects of the world (america?) tour.

      Well, the thing is that no one is questioning whether or not he can do what he wants with the strip.  Of course he can, it is his.  Just like I can do whatever I want with my own little comic or whatever, it wouldn't mean that I'd be above criticism for what I just did. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It isn't like anyone is suggesting Achewood is owned by the public, and we all have an equal say in what goes into it.  That would just be silly, so it is pretty easy to beat down that strawman.  People are just saying, "gee, I wish he wouldn't be  <em>doing this</em>  with his strip.  It is not as good." <br/>

      I just think that some people get their feelings hurt when others voice criticism and thats silly, and when one does that they're acting like a fanboy, though in retrospect is probably not a common reaction. The other end of course, is people feeling personally offended by a strip moving a certain way, as if they were owed anything. Again, it is not a Common thing here. It is common in musical debates, here and elsewhere. Bands that move on are often accused of being sellouts (and they often are) and the old fans have a personal issue with the new ones. I don't want that to happen before a movement is even made.

      The biggest question this raises in my mind is do we  <em>want</em>  Cornelius to be a complex character with flaws, and capable of carrying a storyline? Or would he be better suited to status as the kindly, sophisticated sage we've known him as up until now? To my mind, Connie works best as the warm, fatherly figure of Achewood with a penchant for cooking; somewhat detached from, yet inexplicably fond of the greener characters; sort of like what Teodor might grow up to be if he ever pulls his head out of his ass. Furthermore, do flaws necessarily = complexity? For a supporting character, Cornelius is incredibly nuanced. Ray, Beef, Pat, and Philippe all have shortcomings that have been present since the characters first appeared, and more importantly, those characters work because of their shortcomings. Ray wouldn't be as enjoyable if he weren't the happy-go-lucky, oft-insensitive man who Gets Things Done because it rings true; you probably know someone with some of these traits. Beef has all the qualities Molly appreciates him for, but the reader loves him because of his morbid sensibilities and crippling depression. Pat is a dick. Philippe is five (with all the good and bad that brings). We do not want to see Cornelius as a snob. It's not adding complexity to a flat, 2-dimensional character, it's dragging a well-established and well-liked character through the mud. We've already seen that Cornelius can't really carry the heft of a storyline himself (see: that mess about the bird computer), but that's okay because we enjoy Connie most in juxtaposition with with the other characters. That's why seeing him trade pithy remarks at Ray's expense with a character who can stand her ground against him in wit for basically a month now is getting kind of grating.

Spot on. More writers need to actually think about this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Oh, yeah! Harry is SOOOO complex! Didn't you read the fifth book, Aaron? He was getting all vindictive and he was so flawed! He was depressed and he did not care about Luna and Neville and not even Ron not one little bit maybe oh totters Aaron don't you get it he is just such a character. I think Harry is one of the most complex characters in all of literature because of that book maybe even like Music and stuff too if you're into that. So what's this about this Nikolai Gogol dude. Does he have an album I can buy on iTunes?"

      Ha. This is very well put, a good analogy with harry potter, who, like it or not, is a predictable plot driven story with hamfisted emotional swings slapped on. I would expand this to say that without complex characters (ones that appear interesting to human beings and resemble them by, yes, making mistakes) you're fucked to begin with.

      I think perhaps that this kind of analysis of Connie is the start of Onstad, as I've mentioned before, delving into the more personal aspects of his characters. Up to now most of the characters have been amusing archetypes, to attempt to tag true human depth to intelligently hewn, hilarious archetypes can prove a little off putting and possibly ring entirely untrue.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I'm saying is that this is possibly a transition period, not unlike when the characters actually settled into their current forms (e.g. Connie yelling "I'm definitely not afraid of the police now" to his current sage like state). Onstad may be getting bored with the old format and be truly delineating his characters with more human depth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And once again, my vote is that Onstad drops this ball altogether (sooner or later) and writes the novel he knows he should be. Still, if you have a young child and a decent business you don't bail just because you want to fufil a dream.

      He could do both, it is possible. Not to compare the two but the folks at A Softer World run a multimedia company practically. Joey has written two books so far, and even released one in installments on the webpage.  <br/>

Chris HAS written books, too. He ghostwrote the two Nice Pete books. I would love it if he did more.

      I keep hearing that referenced, but is it truly so much out-of-character for Cornelius or is it merely so correctly in-character for tequila? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the greater problem is that it was one of the strips from the time when it was still about the actions of alive stuffed animals when people were not around trying to understand the world and experience it. They were trying alcohol as it was something that they knew nothing of. If we look at many of those earlier strips now it's more that they're sort of non-canon than anything else.

      My point exactly. Cornelius was already a widower and a world traveler at that time. That's why I say that, for the purposes of continuity and such (and let's try to take a Simpsons view of these sorts of things letting them show up when convenient and ignoring them when not) it's best to pretend that those early strips are not canon with the later ones. He was working on something different then and it gradually evolved into something that no longer supports it's own ancestry.

      Perhaps not, but Cornelius tends to put up with such fuckery with affable charm and good humour. Keep in mind this is the guy who put up with Lyle teabagging his special soup bowl. If he really took this sort of thing to heart, would he still be living with the "spaz spectrum?"

      Hm, fair enough, but Cornelius' bluntness has always stopped short of smarm, a line which I think has been crossed in this arc. Re-reading the strip, he comes off as totally justified in sneaking off from such a putrid dinner for a quickie, but constantly bashing Ray's attempts at hospitality over the past couple of strips has been out of line.

      Frankly, it has taken superhuman temerity  <em>and</em>  a stiff upper-lip to keep Connie from rendering his errant host into a state not in the least disimilar to the putrid (if lyrical) bit of sceptic beef proferred in what can only be seen as a gross attempt at culling the herd of its weak and aged.  <br/>

Frankly, the prospects of a shag in the loo being prefereable to death by sous vide promotes the notion that this weekend's follies have only warmed to room temperature. What will follow? What, indeed! (And can we at all believe that Vlad failed to accessorize the loo?)

      Rowboat, sometimes suicide is the only thing that makes sense.  Suffering for the sake of suffering is worthless shite.

      Redphillip, I think you're taking this discussion in a different direction. This kid did not have some painful, hideous physical ailment. He was just too weak to handle sadness. Now I understand that that happens, and I guess sadness is as good a reason as any when it comes down to it, but he lost any measure of sympathy from me by broadcasting it on the internet. Really. If you're gonna off yourself, wouldn't you want to do it with just a little bit of dignity?

      Give it a little time. This has the potential to be terrific, it may just be a little slow to start up. Think of all the comedic potential that exists here, Cornelius and Polly nailing in a bathroom, Vlad maybe gets miffed that his carefully prepared love environment has been rejected, Ray discovers them screwing but is too excited by the idea of seeing Polly in the buff to leave them be, there's all sorts of things that could happen yet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Give it time. This could be leading someplace wonderful. The whole recent Tina arc ended up pretty rad despite a lukewarm beginning. Given all that's going on here, I'm sure that something interesting is going to happen. Of not, fuck me for having optimism I guess, sorry for not bein' a dick.

      Indeed. She is wearing a dress. I see no need to remove it completely. Skirts are better and much sexier in this context, but I can see the value in remaining at least partly clothed on her part. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do, however, find it a bit rude that they would just go off and engage in the tender act of love in Ray's guest room without speaking to him first. It might just be me, but I consider it very rude to know the gentle flower of a woman (or perhaps some dude's hairy becrusted arsehole if that is to your liking) in someone else's home unless you have been explicitly (or had it very strongly implied in the manner in which such things are done) that it is acceptable to do so. Nobody wants your romantic emictions in their home without prior consent.

      Yeah, not in my house people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was actually staying with some friends a few years ago and they informed me, in a friendly, joking manner, that they were the only people allowed to have sex in the house. It seemed a tad creepy actually as I wouldn't have even considered such an action because of how profoundly rude it would be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It does also cause me to wonder why people seem to think it's entirely reasonable to be at a party and just go off and find someone's room and have sex in their bed because you want to. Boundaries people!

I think the best option would be to invite me to join you in a night of carnal pleasures with your associate and it would naturally occur at my home as this is the only reasonable place. <br/>

Gotta make me think it was my idea to begin with. That's the trick to most of the more successful scams.

It's a pity they haven't released more of it on Region 1. I hear playing PAL discs on an NTSC TV isn't as easy as the reverse, but I'd imagine you could play them on your computer with  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413125135/https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>  or similar.

      I do not believe that all region-frees convert PAL to NTSC though. I mean, I'm generally one who is up on home theater, but imports is an area I'm only theoretically aware of because, well, though I have strong interests in films and genres that would make it very useful I have never wanted to spend that sort of money. Also, I do not even have that sort of money. Or hassle.

      I have over 500 discs filling my Netflix queue well beyond capacity and I would say that the vast majority of those are foreign films that I'm working my way through. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The sheer quantity of good films that have been released and are being released each year around the world is problematic. I guess it's a good thing that so much of American output is completely without even the slightest bit of merit. I need the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've also been trying to switch more exclusively to Blu-Ray. Best not to be spending any money on the format of the past. Thankfully the US and Japan are finally in the same Blu-Ray region and since we both are NTSC it will finally be much easier. Now if only I actually understood Japanese....

      I'm not talking about bunnies, but grad students. I don't think it's possible to be valued less. At the same time, like in all relationships of slaves, they are absolutely indispensable and you would be nothing without them. Is tough line to be walking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for aminals. Well, it depends on the research you're doing. Cosmetics? Uh, no. But real, serious research? I love animals, but sometimes you really need to fiddle with some rats' genes. Personally I have historically worked with nothing higher than  <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> , but still. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sadly, this has been a major impediment in finding a job I feel. Almost everyone seems to want rat handling experience and I have none. It wasn't even remotely relevant to my research. I prefer the sort of basic research, but most stuff around here seems to be more medically oriented and they want stuff that's more directly applicable. Frankly, that's also the sort of thing that interests me less. Science, to me, is it's own end.

      So my friend was working as a lab tech at Mount Sinai, and he had to do a lot of work with mice. Unfortunately, the mice often had to be euthanized afterwards for various reasons. He told me this was done via a miniature gas chamber in a special room that was, in a rather understated euphemism, simply called the 'mouse room'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My first question was: "Do you tell the mice that they're just going to take a shower?"

      Yeah, I sometimes watch things late from the TiVo (like the 32 episodes of Doctor Who I've got sitting around or the last 4 episodes of Battlestar Galactica from this past first half of the season), but watching it late on Hulu just makes it recent and not "extremely recent". Just because you watched it late isn't an excuse. <br/>

      Well, 150 degrees is a bit over what is typically called for, but really it's the time. It should only be cooked for maybe 2-3 hours most of the time. Using a proper circulating water bath with proper temperature control would also be ideal for safety. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also note that he does not appear to be using a vacuum-sealed bag, but a simple Ziploc bag and this would likely be ineffective at inhibiting the growth of aerobic bacteria as well as proper heat conduction. <br/>

      You would not say that if you had ever tried eating them raw. Just about anything you could coat them in is better than that. The best method of course is to grind them up into a nice cup of cranberry tea. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This only goes for the dried, sketchy kind that you are likely to find in the States. In Amsterdam you can get a package of nice fresh mushrooms that are clearly labeled by type and specific effects, and you can pay for it with your credit card. They do not taste great on their own, but they are tolerable enough to put on a pizza or some such thing.

      I posit he would.  <foodNerd>A prime rib is basically the most tender part of a cow after the filet.  It is soft, and when cooked properly can be cut with a sharp spoon.  Ray knows that it is a prized piece of meat.  He has also heard of sous vide.  It is a way of cooking slowly to melt collagen without overcooking meat.  It makes tough meat tender.  In his mind, combining these things will make him the man. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In reality, there is very little connective tissue in a rib roast.  Sous vide will just cook it slowly, not really do much of anything.  You won't get that tasty browning on the outside, you won't get the taste of smoke or melted beef fat.  This would be a terrible meal even if he did make it remotely sanitary (I'd go at least 135 at home). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fucking something up at a fundamental level while trying to impress people with a skill he doesn't really have could only sound more Ray if he promised it wouldn't give anyone diabetes.</foodNerd>

 <em>Tekende's latest effort, though not without a certain fulfilling directness, was not up to the usual standards of the veteran poster. The italics for emphasis? I believe we've been seeing quite a lot of this lately and we could certainly do with some new methods. Still, it was short, to the point, and clarified his general statement fairly well with just a bit of edge. If anything the problem lies in his inability to escape from his own promise. We know he can deliver better and so when we get merely average it seems like less in comparison. 3/5</em>

      Sometimes Zapatos talks as though he pretends to get a lot of tail.  Sometimes he talks like he actually gets a lot of tail.  Being able to cook a great meal for a woman will get you more trim than a pimp's car.

      I concur. Ideally Ray would also give it a quick sear with a blowtorch after taking it out of the bag, but he'd probably totally screw that up as well. I don't even want to imagine how he might have seasoned it not knowing the effects that sous vide can have on some of the most basic of flavorings. I can see him putting some very pricey olive oil in there and making it taste all rank. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Grilling a nice fillet is really the better option. Assuming he has the appropriate degree of skill to handle the grill properly (and while I would normally doubt this, I suspect that he has spent enough time at the grill to get there) I do not see how he could improve on this. It's not impressive, but it will almost always yield the superior meal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again Ray is the type to use a gas grill because it's significantly pricier and he can get one of those massive outdoor kitchen installations put in. Lump charcoal only fool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If he has the chops and wants to get all fancy-pants for the trendy-food crowd at least just lay out with a proper  <em>Bistecca alla fiorentina</em>  and call it a night. You need to fancy up your steak with a nice bit of a patter and some pricey rare beef that's a nice solid way of doing it without much chance of screwing it up aside from the usual.

      Yeah. Dicks thought that cupcakes had to be made upscale and that they were "soooo cuuuuutte!!!" and started selling them for horrible prices and trying to just make them fancy as fuck. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem is that cupcakes are forever just inferior cake that is eaten only because it is easier to pass them out for an elementary school birthday, Halloween party, or birthday celebrated at a trivia contest in a local bar. They are tinged with sadness that they are not proper cakes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cake itself is ideally just a substrate for the application of frosting. Not that the cake itself can't be good, but without frosting it is nothing. The frosting is the real star of the show. Cupcakes further reduce that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But yeah, they even did a cupcake episode on Good Eats. Are cupcakes still going on? I mean, I still see some of it, but it seems like the craze has died down a bit. Pommes frites seem to be on the rise, but I don't know how poised they are to becoming a thing yet. If more places want to open serving them with mussels though... oh dear god people this needs to be the way. How can we keep getting our asses kicked by Europe in so many different ways!?!? Why is the average American so unable to get, for example (and not European at all, but no matter) unable to get a good bowl of feijoada easily?

      But it tastes entirely like what Americans love. It is all smoked pork and sausage and beans and deliciousness. Just push as it as being like red beans and rice, but with even more delicious meat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It does, in all fairness, take too long for me to make at home. I get mine out. I just want more Brazilian places around to get it. I just crave foods from basically all cultures and less of this bullshit fusion or upscale comfort food or New American or whatever crap people are peddling these days because they think we have to constantly be trying to dick out over our food instead of just realizing that there's tons of great food around the world already we just need to embrace more of it. Not torture existing food to try and make it fancy and "exciting". <br/> 
 <br/> 
The upscale comfort food thing just really bothers me the most though. I don't care what cheese you used or what else you did to it it's still a bowl of macaroni in a cheese sauce. Let's just admit that liking that is a normal thing and it doesn't have to be jacked up to $20 a serving. Simple food is often good food. Just don't go all Alice Waters minimalist hippie on me and try to pass off a peach in a bowl with a story about how great it is for $8. Unless I'm mistaken this happened here recently at Zuni. Except it wasn't even in a bowl. It was on a plate, washed, but otherwise whole. IIRC the price was actually $8. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is a point in between (I shall now refer to this as the Keller/Waters axis) where food is great and delicious.

      Of course it tastes like what Americans love... that doesn't mean any of them are going to eat it. Hell, look at our "Food Network" - though there are a few diamonds in the rough, the majority of the on-air talent are a bunch of bobbleheads possessing questionable culinary merit telling folks "HEY, it's okay to not actually cook... just buy premade shit and jazz it up with some herbs and some EE VEE OHH OHH and you'll be, like, a four-star cook, teehee!" The rousing success of programs like these is just a symptom of the underlying disease - Americans do not, on the whole, want to be adventurous with their food.

      Yeah, I mean a line gets crossed at some point (many scholars suggest it is the taint) where food is no longer exotic and interesting, and just nasty shit peasants and other such rabble were forced to eat while the kings ate the prime cuts, eventually developing into a "cultural dish".

      I'd say that's not so much a lack of desire to be adventurous and more of a problem with the Food Network's positioning. They realized that by kicked off the actual chefs (even if many of them were assholes or had bad shows they at least had some merit in being there) and replacing them with more lifestyle oriented shows that appeal to the bored housewives who want to throw dinner parties and make their friends think they're fancy. Very much the Ray sort of audience, but, well, even Ray is above that sort of thing. This audience is much more appealing to advertisers trying to sell up-market appliances and convenience foods and such.

      I can't find it because Penny Arcade's search function is woefully lacking, but there was a strip a couple years ago where Microsoft is doing a survey to decide what games should be backwards compatible with the 360, and Gabe, along with a few little girls, choose Barbie Horse Adventures as one of the games. I'm pretty sure it was the first mention of Gabe's love of Barbie horse things.

      I don't remember this strip but I like it. I haven't played  <em>Enchanted Arms</em>  but it seems like RPGs get an irrational amount of flack for sticking to the genre when so other game genres innovate. It's like your RPG has to be  <em>Final Fantasy XII</em>  now or better or else it's complete shit.

      But didn't XII basically take most of the control away from the player? I know that's a major reason why I didn't want to play it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dungeon Siege is even worse though. It was a somewhat decent rip-off of Diablo when you only had one person in your party, but when you start adding more it just feels like you're the equipment manager for a group of adventurers. You pick up treasure, outfit them, and then sell off what you don't want in the next town along the one, linear path that literally leads directly through the entire game. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My girlfriend likes it, but I suspect that the main reason is because she likes the donkey you get. She prefer the first one named Flare.

      Hmm... my issue is that cupcakes lack the same high frosting-to-cake ratio that we have in proper cakes. I also spurn sheet cakes for this very same reason. It's layer cakes or nothing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I have also been known to just scoop ready-made frosting out of the tub with Nilla wafers and eat it directly. Or eat cold chocolate frosting from the fridge with a spoon. <br/>

As I think I've said before, nothing can ever possibly be too sweet.

      If he were to follow the sous vide'd rib with a quick searing, if he has a skillet large enough--or, if he desired, he could separate the ribs and prepare them individually--in order to achieve the results of the Maillard reaction on the fat--browning and added flavor and so on--he would, achieve the optimal tenderness of the sous vide method (which is still more tender than if it had been cooked conventionally) while retaining the "taste of smoke [and/]or melted beef fat." This, to the best of my knowledge, is actually the preferred method for many professional chefs preparing meat by sous vide. However, Ray's decision to cook it in the water bath for five days is way off the mark--even at 120ºF, which anyway is slightly too cold even for rare rib, four and a half hours should suffice, since, as hedonismbot points out, prime rib is a tender cut of meat and does not need the collagen-dissolving effects of braising the meet for lengthy periods of time (which even so need not exceed 100 hours). With a cut such as prime rib, the benefits are extremely negligible--and all this is assuming that he took the proper precautions against health risks, which he may well have not.

      A few issues with that. For one, would not the loo for dogging be, at least, in such as a public park and most definitely not a private home? Keep in mind, always, the difference in meaning between a British fanny and an American one. I suggest first one and then the other, but not all ladies will appreciate being Americanized in this fashion. I also suggest that we keep our history in mind and realize that once you've gone American you can never go British again without washing off quite a bit unless you want to potentially cause all sorts of nasty infections. <br/>

      Ok maybe I should have stated that there are some outliers (I do realize that most of you are in your twenties) but I'm guessing if you took the average age of the normal Assetbarbarian it would be in the range I presented. <br/>

I wanted to say Average in there but it didn't flow right. I misspoke.

All of their menu items are something like "I am Fulfilled" or "I Am Giving" and you are  <strong>required</strong>  to say the full, listed name to order it because it's part of their thing.

      It was always slightly stylized, but in a way that still felt natural. Now it's moving beyond that is what he's saying. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm trying to come up with a good example, but I can't think of one where people won't just say that it was always excessively artificial and stylized. Conversation requires a certain amount of style to it to begin with. A dash of flair and personality. If it's not there then you're just flapping meat at each other.

      While I agree that, in the past, and ESPECIALLY with the Ray and Beef chats, it's flowed alot better, but Achewood dialogue has always been overstuffed with obscure references and unnecessary prose. I think it's only more pronounced now because we are more becoming more aware of some of the faults in the strip.

      Obscure references specifically have only recently started cropping up in just about every strip.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Whoever it was that first said Achewood was turning into Dennis Miller was pretty much right on.  At least, Cornelius is turning into Dennis Miller.  The unnecessary prose was more or less clever turns-of-a-phrase, and assorted wordplay.  It wasn't really these epic paragraphs, chockful of Words and References. <br/> 
 <br/> 
in other words: <br/> 
I no like-a the references. When I am younger, sure, ok, but not so much now.  Maybe I change, maybe they change. Who knows?

      Even if the Okapi creation myth and tortoiseshell comb, the examples you mentioned before, are indeed references, they're certainly not ones that rely on specific prior knowledge to be appreciated. The tortoiseshell comb is clearly a sign used to imply that the person or people who left it are engaging in coitus. Whether this is true for real life or not, what Cornelius is implying is easy to understand. In terms of the Okapi and the potato, I somewhat doubt that there's much more meaning to it than it being an appropriately unsanitary-sounding idea for how a culture of bacteria might explain its creation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not being American, I'm one of the readers who's easily more susceptible to missing a reference, and I really don't feel like I've been kept in the dark, here. Ovewrought analogies have been a feature of Achewood dialogue since the golden ages, and if Cornelius' dialogue has altered at all since the arrival of Polly, it's likely just because he now feels that he can speak in confidence that however much florid nonsense spouts from his gob, she will be able to understand it, or at least a lot better than the likes of Ray or Todd.

      Alright.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Enough. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is officially the last straw.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've been very patient with this. I've kind of liked a few individual strips from it. I've tried to stay upbeat. Ray's part has been as strong as ever, I think. But somehow this is it. It's very clear to me now; this is the least interesting arc that has ever been. Polly is the least appealing character that has ever been. This arc has even made me seriously question my feelings about Connie, who, while never being my absolute favorite character, or anything, has always been pretty solid in my book. Polly's just terrible and she brings out the worst in him. Not only aren't they at all funny, but they remind me directly of all the worst real-life couples I have ever known. If this was the intended impression, I know that Onstad would work it wonderfully. But I get the idea that we may actually be supposed to  <em>like</em>  this character and that just gives me a cold shiver. <br/> 
 <br/> 
OK. I just had to get that out. I didn't think it would come to that, but when I found myself physically unable to rate this any higher than a 2, I knew it was time to face up to it. I mean, I don't think I've gone below a 3 since, like, the  <em>guest strips,</em>  or something. It's been a long-ass time is the point.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just to clarify, I'm not worried about the general state of the comic. The unrelated strips have been as good as ever. Nor do I care that the strips are so few and far between, these days. I know he's got a lot on his plate and that's a good thing. But this is the worst arc ever and that's that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Whew. I feel better already.

The three arcs prior the Wedding were EASILY the worst, in descending order, starting with the awesomeness of the Kazenkxzis Card Company arc, then to the general meh-ness of the Shrovis arc, to the bland stupidity of the Nice Pete-Ray biography thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This has had it's moments. I agree that Polly isn't exactly appealing, but I like how each of the female characters bring out different feelings in their counterparts (when you think about it, every male non-robot character excluding Lyle and Todd have had prominent female counterparts that have played a role in some way.

      Yeah sorry guy that has Nice Pete avatar, it's not the character itself it was just that that "Arc" (it hardly felt like one since it was only three strips long or something) was so weak. The whole idea of Nice Pete looking up to Ray had been done already so it was basically a rehash and it almost felt like an excuse for Onstad to type a lot of words in and get us to say HAHA LOOK @ NICE PETE HE SHUR HAZ A FUNNEH WAI OF SAYIN THINGZ.

      Basically what I'm trying to say is that Onstad created the arc because he hadn't used Nice Pete in a while, and I feel like he should have waited and saved that for the Wedding arc OR done some interesting Pulp Fiction-style ending where all three arcs converged into one big clusterfuck to lead to the Wedding. Basically none of those arcs had real endings. <br/>

      Your sentence structure in the first paragraph is turning my mind to dust (you seem to indicate that the Kazenzakis Card Company arc was at the same time awesome  <em>and</em>  among the worst?), but I'm pretty sure that the only thing I agree with you about is that the Shrovis arc was indeed substandard. But not like this. That one was at least a little bizarre. This one is just.... <em>bleh.</em>

      Yeah I screwed the pooch on that. I was trying to say that all in all those three pre-wedding arcs seemed like a burn off of decent ideas Onstad had that would have seemed too weird after the Wedding. The Card Company one was great up until the whole thing with the stewardess, then it got weird and never ended truly. The Shrovis one was merely ok with some good parts but also didn't really end and the whole Nice Pete And Ray Make An Autobiography was both lame AND played out.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
These are words I should have said earlier. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I agree somewhat that this arc has started kind of slow but there have been good times.

      She just seems like a blank space. I think I'm likening her to some girls I've known who just do this chameleon thing with whatever man they're in a relationship with at that moment. That's what I seem to see here. I don't think it's just that Onstad has trouble writing women, which seems to be a popular observation. I never felt this way about Molly. <br/>

      I think everyone places too much importance in the legacy of arcs.  Sure there's been important stories like The Party, Phillipe/Transfer Station, Phillipe Kidnapped, GOF of course, the wedding, I suppose, but that's a late-comer, Road Trip, etc.  Some were funny, some established characters, etc., but it seems like we're all expecting another GOF, and that's ridiculous.  I'd love something on that level (but a sequel would make me cry), but we should be able to deal with arcs day to day and not shit ourselves just because the alt text isn't a punctuation mark or because Phillipe isn't wearing a bee suit (seriously my favorite arc).

      They were in the act of sitting in a car as one drove it, so the car was being driven and by extension they were being driven with it.  Maybe riding would have worked better but it wouldn't have implied one of them was driving so I took a chance with suggesting both were driving it.  I stand by my phrasing.  Fuck your British speakingness.

      Hey, I'm just playin' with the hand he deals me, nice. If it were up to me, arcs would be relatively rare. Maybe, like, two or three short ones per year. Without exception, all of my favorite strips are one-offs. I was never even super-jazzed about the GOF.

      I understand that but for the sake of my comment I was stating that you could read that arc WITHOUT reading the supplemental stuff. Without the blogs everyone would be calling Connie a British bear. <br/>

Sorry,  <strong>I'm just being a dick about you learning to read my comment before being a dick.</strong>

      I really don't understand how. I fairly clearly stated that the Volvo arc was popular probably because it requires the least amount of knowledge about the main characters private lives and yet you came at me with a heavily documented statement which is the very definition of KNOWING A MAIN CHARACTER'S PRIVATE LIFE. I was not saying what I said was canon, I was saying it from an outsider perspective. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically what I am saying is prepare to live in a world where the primary activity is tasting my hog.

      Hmm... I do not share your rating system. I give the vast majority a 3. Far fewer ever see the 4. Almost none are lucky enough to anointed with a 5 which is reserved for the very best. <br/>

I grade on a bell curve and I do so with respect to the other strips in the comic. This arc, though not great, has generally been 3 for me, much like most strips.

As far as things to be obsessed with it's a lot better than model trains. As long as you're not a dick about it. It is implicit in being obsessed with model trains that you are a dick about it. That is basically all it is about. Tiny people, tiny villages, massive pricks.

      <em>Proceedings</em>  has more rigor, it is true, but I find their insistence on sticking solely to pederasty to be pedantic and not entirely germane to the discussion here. I am concerned only with Greek greek (not necessarily by Greeks, however). <br/>

      Okay, now you're definitely reading Achewood for the wrong reasons. Honestly, I never saw why the GOF was put on such a high pedestal. The dialogue was satisfactory and the presentation of the Ray-Beef relationship was excellent, but I didn't see it as being at all better than, say, Philippe at the transfer station. Was its true source of attraction because so many Achewood readers are apparently action starved?

      Astute observation.  I never considered the real world inspirations, other than it would have been some nice character development, which it was.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I personally just love the whole legacy and mystique of the fight and the history Chris made up.  I understand when he does things like that, like the whole Underground system and the map of Achewood, police blotters, etc.  It adds some realism and expands the universe of your characters and stories.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I always add seemingly unnecessary little tidbits to my writing or drawings to make it more real, make it seem like there's more going on than what's apparent.  Attention to detail is the hallmark of good writers: it's why James Joyce took 30 pages to write a story he could've written in 7 (specifically I'm talking about "The Dead" because I like it and I'm writing a paper on it right now).  The reader should be able to appreciate that the details are for their benefit and enjoyment if they pick up on it.

      That's an awful lot of words considering that your main point is that you dislike Polly and you didn't really give any reason for that at all. I'm ambivalent towards her at the moment, because I don't feel like her character's been explored in any depth beyond being a board which Cornelius can bounce his long-winded musings off of. This doesn't mean she's a shallow character, it just means that she hasn't yet had the chance to be given any depth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really don't get the impression that Onstad's trying to sell Cornelius and Polly as likeable in this situation, though. Like you said, their interactions have been an excellent reflection of the darker side of overtly intellectual and clandestinely judgmental couples. Honestly, with this, and with the earlier example of the Shrovis-Bishopthorpe arc, I think Onstad's been trying to create an element of weakness in a character that before now has seemed all too infallible.

      Is it normal for everyone involved in a dinner party to assume that the invited guest is going to be having sex in the guest room after the meal? Is this why our hosts always look vaguely insulted when my wife and I just say goodbye and drive home?

      You should do it in the garage or, if you have access to an appropriate one, basement. SJE needs to know that the juices have a place to sluice away to, i.e. a room with a drain in the floor.

      The only garage is the parking garage, which we have talked about doing it in but have decided against thanks to the presence of security guards and the smallness of my Elantra's backseat. <br/>

There are no basements in South Florida, especially not in Tampa. You dig a certain depth into ground, you hit limestone, you flood your basement.

      My father used to live in Miami for a good number of years. I totally know what the deal is with basements there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I too live about a mile from the ocean. Most of the city is built on sand or at least not bedrock. Basements are totally not go here either. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Our garage is shared with our neighbors in the house. It has the laundry there and would thus seem like an ideal place for the making of whoopee (to get all Newlywed about it), but recently our neighbor's car has been there and it would be rude to do that on someone else's car. Also, that would so not happen. Not with my girlfriend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On this topic let me suggest that this is a main problem of starting to date when you are still rather young and in high school. You are likely at a stage when relationships still move a bit more slowly and sex is not really happening so quickly. This means that by the time you get to the phase where it would be happening more quickly you've been together long enough that a lot of the early-relationship fuckfest nature is gone. It also depends on the person you are dating. Choose wisely here young Assetbarbarians.

      I'm totally ok with my sex life. When we are together we fuck frequently enough where it is not to the point where it is an absolute necessity for me to do so. There have been times, yes, where we have gone a week or so without because of scheduling conflicts or T.O.Ms but generally when that is resolved it either equates to a fest of sorts or to us running into the bathroom if her roommate is there. But sex is not something that I feel is necessary in our relationship. I am with her because I care about her, she cares about me, we share most of the same interests and for other reasons i will not mention because there is a limit for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Our awesome sexings are only a plus. <br/>

      College is probably fine, but if you start earlier than that you run into the problem of still having to get to that stage of your life and such and by the time it actually starts up with the sex you're close to running out of the early stages of a relationship and moving much closer to the scary recesses of stereotype where sex is the dim memory of an unreliable drunk. Maybe once a week if you are lucky. All having to always initiate it yourself with someone who does not consider it to be one of her interests and who could probably just go celibate without too much of a problem. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The worst was a drought of about two months or so once, maybe a bit longer. Christmas and being home got in the way and then being home it became a Thing and trying to break the tension surrounding it was too much to be handled so I was out of luck for a long time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Never neglect the very important need to have a similar degree of need and desire. If that's out of whack it will just lead to all sorts of problems. A twice-a-day Savage Love fan who is up on all of the perversions of the Internet is not really the best type for someone for whom it is once a fortnight and missionary is a bit kinky.

She tells me, get this guys,  <em>she tells me</em>  she had a kid!  So I'm like, pah, no sale, sister! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I high-tail it outta there before she gets to tellin' me about her name, and the friction caused by my prompt entry and subsequent exit of her vagina caused me to emit some sexual discharge on the way home, because I am a slow and gentle lover.

      I have to say I'm a bit upset about calling her a "bitch". I mean, not cool. <br/>

Also, pretending to like Evanescence is not acceptable in any way. Far worse than boinking in front of child (he will have to learn some day and will likely never remember this). <br/>

Worst part? She is leaving child at home to go out and pick up man-sluts? Who is watching child? Terrible mother!

      So I picked this bitch up from the bar, we were singing karaoke and I was pretending to like Evenescence.  We get back to her place and I bend push her onto her couch, she falls back and her knees are above the couch arm.   <br/> 
I grabbed her belt and pulled those pants right off! <br/> 
So I'm down on her, doing my thing, getting some screams... <br/>

And I notice her two year old son standing at the foot of the stairs, on my immediate right.  Woh.

Anyway, GH, I was likening Prius Chaser's lame-slinging style to that of a famous 20th century assassin. Whenever someone goes down the line laming comments without adding anything I always think of it in terms of a sniper just kind of out in the trees somewhere (or in a clock tower in Austin) takin' potshots. It's sad.

      Does Whitman really qualify as an assassin? I thought that implied a specific target. I'd say he was more of a spree killer. Unless I'm technically wrong and that requires more of a prolonged spree in the manner of Starkweather.

      Because you don't want to hear it, I will give my opinion on Mr. Bear's dickishness.  First off, Ray is being a monstrous tool.  This isn't new to Mr. Bear, I don't think that's the real heart of it.  I think he is behaving like this because it is how he's always likely been.  We've never seen much inner dialogue from him when he's irritated (happens a lot).  Notice how he's been very gentlemanly to Ray this whole time?  He hasn't really spoken up against the man in his own house yet.  Polly is acting as an excuse to show what he's thinking, and of course he's annoyed (and a bit dickish). <br/> 
 <br/> 
The difference between a gentleman and an asshole isn't that the gentleman never thinks ill of people, it's that he never acts on it.  Mr. Bear is just talking privately about his annoyance with his arm candy, but he's still acting the part of a gentleman.

      Yeah, I know Connie's keeping it above the table. I know he has reasons to be irritated with Ray and I think he's handling it pretty well. I guess it's more Polly that pisses me off. I mean, she just met the man and she's all smug as the dickens over there.

      Yeah.  I tend to defend Achewood pretty heavily, but I just can't get into Polly.  She's a cliched concept to begin with, then she acts as a much more boring Mr. Bear, then she basically serves as a sounding board (one that makes my favorite character show is inner douche).  Not a good character to be.

      Cornelius is kind of being a dick, but he is getting some seriously hot action for the first time in years (decades?) so his perspective is skewed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We don't know why Polly became a stripper.  We do know she is not the normal meth-head or crack-whore or heroin-whatever that ends up stripping until her body breaks down.  She has some measure of class and style.  So I am not about to judge her without more back story. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray is the only one I am disliking during this arc.  Not that his reactions are out of character or anything.  He just can't help being a dick when he sees a stripper away from her pole.

      In all fairness I was a bit sidetracked towards the end by the project to repair the Bay Bridge. After the earthquake in '89 it was determined to be dangerously unable to withstand another one and we very much needed to seismically upgrade it. That was '89. It is almost twenty years later and we still haven't finished it. The construction has taken so long that the cost of steel has significantly risen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In all fairness a lot of this is because of bureaucratic issues and needing to coordinate multiple counties and agencies to get it together and everyone has something going on with it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again the program to introduce a smart card system for regional transit systems was originally started some time back in the 90s and was expected to be rolled out in '02 it currently is not accepted officially (although it works pretty much all the time, but you can't do things like load a monthly pass on it or use it on many systems) at the present, but another testing phase is going on. There was already a testing phase in '02. Again, this is due to bureaucratic in-fighting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You'd think there would be technical proficiency here in what is the capitol of American computer technology. There is largely not. It is pretty amazing how much we can manage to not be with it at times. Transit is probably the biggest thing we totally and amazingly suck at though.

      One could also say that the Bay Bridge project got sidetracked for the better part of a decade because Jerry Brown decided to make it a monument to his own ego.  Also, because the state of California is totally broke. <br/> 
 <br/> 
BTW Jerry Brown, who I used to sort of work for, is much shorter than you think he is.  So much so that it's disturbing.

      I don't think so. I'm pretty sure he's about as short as I think he is. I don't really care about that. I liked Kucinich (let us all agree, at least, that he had the most smoking-hot wife of any candidate and with a sexy acccent... dude was the fucking winner no matter what else happened right there) and never got why everyone just ragged on him because the due is a bit short. <br/>

Maybe it's just a thing of me because I'm 5'9" and my girlfriend is 5'10". <br/>

I think you can't ignore the problems brought about by Willie Brown either. The whole bullshit about wanting to develop a mall or such on Treasure Island and then bitching with the Corp. of Engineers about placing the struts was just the most actual form of dick-shittery.

It always interests me how so many American liberals can continue to support incredibly watered-down moderate candidates that, in this country, basically means they're not so much liberal as not hard right. Do they just not ever want to get anything they believe in?

      Belgand:  Jerry Brown is much shorter than you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I worked for the Oakland City Attorney's office for a time when Jerry Brown was mayor.  I was in law school at the time, but it was well before I became disillusioned and embittered, so I admired the guy, as well as thought it was so strange to be working for the guy who was governor when I was born.  This was in his living-in-an-ashram and wearing wearing black nehru jackets phase.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I got on an elevator, dropped something and forgot to push a button, and the elevator goes up to the mayor's floor.  The mayor gets on and pushes the button for the ground floor.  I took the opportunity to introduce myself, and he says "Law school?  How's that working out for you?"  I replied noncommittally, and he says as he's walking out of the elevator, "Best of luck, kid, but don't forget it ain't real." <br/> 
 <br/> 
For a midget, he really dominates an elevator.

      I remember my mom buying a pack of candy cigarettes for my brother and me during a trip to the opening of Disneyworld in 1972.  They had a little red tip to simulate the burning ash.  Even back then I knew they were the worst candy ever.  Like chewing on a overly sweet stick of Rolaids - chalk flavor.  I never knew the horror of valentines message candy until the following year in 1st grade.  Somehow I came across a pack of candy cigs just this year and tried to offer them to my kids (for old time's sake).  They were having none of it. <br/>

      In Australia the cigarette lollies were called "Fags" now they are called "Fads". We also had a cigar lolly called "Big Boss Cigars", now they are called "Big Boss Dynamite". I am against smoking, but surely putting a cigar in your mouth is a little safer than chewing down on a stick of high explosive?

      True, but it really is the only way. People post their solutions to the problem and we will judge them on their output. Right now we usually have a monopoly where once someone produces an image it's all we get. The animal/wizardry bit recently was rather nice though.

      If anyone hasn't read the two blogs yet, Ray with the Italian Dude and Roast Beef's take on it, they are much funnier than the current strip.

      Apparently I'm not alone in thinking that the dialogue seems a little forced lately. Panel 9 in particular is incredibly awkward. I know Connie is technically American, but it's still jarring when his register drifts from  <em>English toff</em>  to  <em>generic Brit</em> . "Let's go shag in the loo" is nearly as out-of-character as "WHOO! I am DEFINITELY not afraid of the fucking POLICE right now!" <br/>

      I'm pretty sure it's 10 chubs, though it might be limited to 5 until the strip is a day old or something. I'm fairly stingy with mine until a day or two goes by, so I'm not sure. As for lames, I have no fuckin' clue.

      That is what I indicated; however, I no longer believe this to be the case. I've definitely given out 10 chubbies on some older pages with less than 200 comments. I think the Assetbar admins enjoy leaving us these little mysteries to unravel.

I don't care anymore, I only came here to discuss a webcomic and maybe meet some interesting people. I've done both but it seems I've done more damage to the community than anything, and I don't want to be a part of it anymore. I recognize that often I delved too much into my personal life, but it's not like every other person here hadn't done the same thing.

1) You can talk about whatever you like, and if you think a conversation is boring, skip the thread. <br/> 
1 1/2) Maybe try to talk about achewood, but if not, that's okay too. <br/>

      Yeah, that Assetbar exchange was where I first saw it (odd, since I thought I'd seen everything superdickery.com had to offer). It's not by Scott McCloud, but it's the sort of thing he might use as an example of how not to do comics. There's a terrific panel in  <em>Understanding Comics</em>  of a superhero throwing a punch at a villain, missing, and hitting a brick wall, saying,  <em>Blast! I missed him, and struck this brick wall instead!</em>  The villain sneers,  <em>Hah! Dodged ya!</em>  Narration:  <em>The Captain's mighty blow misses its intended target!</em>  (This right here is a great example of telling when I should be showing, but I don't have a copy of the book. Sorry, Scott)

      I think the recent strips have been okay. Achewood's had better periods, for sure, but remember that Onstad's been doing all these recent strips while coordinating a ten-city book tour, not to mention staying on top of the premium content, New York Times pieces, miscellaneous media appearences, and filling holiday orders. I'm amazed he's put anything up at all.

      I think this is the problem inherent with the Premium Content. Yes, it is understood that he has a family, but he's been doing this for what, 6, 7 years? He's had the kid for what, 3 or 4 years?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If the Premium Content wasn't presumably interfering with the regular content I would have no problem, but why should we have to suffer through Onstad's less-than-best just so he can show some images to people who pay 3.99 a month?

      I'm not a subscriber (yet), so I don't know for sure. I definitely didn't mean to come off as critical of the premium features or anything; it just seems like Onstad has a lot of additional obligations at the moment -- I imagine the book tour has a lot more to do with it than the premium content, though.

      But you forgot all the other things he mentioned. All of these things combined may, indeed, be the problem. But compared to the book tour, the time spent on the premium content is minimal, I'm sure.

      The problem there though is that those people are only interested in paying for the Premium content because they liked the free stuff a lot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you start producing a lower quality free gag to concentrate your efforts on more exclusive content, you'll eventually just run dry on new subscribers to the exclusive--because anyone new seeing the free stuff now is going to think it isn't worth paying for.  Meanwhile, people who are remembering 'the golden days' are willing to pay, because they're expecting that same level of quality.  If they aren't getting it (which I have no idea if they are, or not) they'll eventually just stop subscribing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not that I think that is what is going on here, I think the premium content is just what it was advertised as: extra stuff that isn't necessarily higher or lower quality.

      The premium content just does not look worth it though. I know there are people out there who genuinely care about the lives of fake cats but I have a very small expendable income and cannot afford to give up even 3.99 a month on something like that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just don't understand how NOW feeding is kid is a problem. I always figured he was making enough money on the books and other merchandise and I also figured his wife had a job too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think that the premium content is draining the supply of Onstad's genius though, I think that touring is. I know that it is often hard for musicians to tour for long periods of time and then write songs right after.

      Hi. I'm a lurker. I've been following Achewood for over a year, read very arc at least twice. I love reading your comments, but I refrain from joining the fun. This is my second post. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just wanted to drop in my two cents about the whole `decline of Achewood' sentiment. I think we're all in agreement that recent strips are generally inferior to the old ones. There's a lot of debate on why this is, and frankly I'm surprised no-one's pointed out that Onstad has been pissing humour for years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It may well be that Onstad feels constricted by these characters. They are by now well established, and deciding what to do with them next is tricky. He's hinted at such before, with the `achewood machine' arc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For me, recent strips feel like experiments. Let's see if we can evolve characters in this direction...will it work? Will it be funny? Will a slight change in character cascade into something major? <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's possible that the well is dry. All good things have an end; and while I'm not outright saying that this is the end of Achewood, we might be watching it evolve into something else, as it has done repeatedly in the past-for example with the introduction of Ray, Roast Beef, and Pat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm sure Onstad will appreciate constructive criticism, but I doubt it's going to do much at this stage; Onstad is already a master of his medium. I believe the root of the problem is that ideas are running out. That golden stream of humour is turning to a trickle. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I'm right, then only change will allow Achewood to survive. It's only change that create new paths for the established characters. Will we like these changes? Perhaps that's irrelevant. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I believe we may be watching an evolution similar to Pat realising he's gay. At the end of the day, Pat remained pretty much exactly the same despite his new appearance, relationship, and sexual orientation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We're just going to have to wait and see.

      Yeah, I realize that everything must end and that we're damn lucky to have gotten as much as we have from it and all that. But I maintain that the one-off strips are just about as good as they ever have been. Whether or not this whole comic is winding down, I think he could salvage it or at least successfully prolong it with a little (or long) break from the arcs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm sure it's not that simple, but that would at least make this one reader happy, and at the end of the day that's what I really care about. This one reader.

      This is well-thought-out and I'm glad you posted it.  I've been noticing that the Onstar has talked about a writing career more and more often in interviews.  I think even he knows he's painted into a corner here, and would like to try something new.  If he puts out a grown-up humor book, like David Sedaris or such, I would buy it.  I would not read reviews, or even look at the price.  I would by a humorous book by Chris Onstadt, just prose, no matter what.

      My father had motor neurone disease. In all of my memories of him he is sitting powerlessly watching the world go by. He was pretty desperate for a cure, but he was sure he was going to beat it, utterly determined. He died when I was eight.

      That brings up a rough memory, octafish, although you couldn't have known. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This was my youngest sister's favorite song. She sang it until we were sick of it. And then some more. <br/> 
 She was roommates for a while with Maureen "Little Mo" Connolly, who was a former world champion tennis player. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 My sister was Ms. Connolly's hero, so she said, because of her courage. They were both some of the world's first experimental chemotherapy patients at Baylor University's Wadley Clinic in Dallas. It was 1969. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 My sister died of recurring aplastic anemia, a form of leukemia, aged 5, a month after I graduated high school. Death of a child is a hard thing. <br/> 
 Ms. Connelly died a few weeks later.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry if that's O.T. and a bummer. You hit 2 aces blindfolded with your post. <br/>

 I'm gonna have a shot of Jamesons now and appreciate the good times. <br/>

      Guys, we need to talk. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We've spent a lot of time here discussing the decline of Achewood, but no one has seen fit to mention that a similar phenomenon is taking place on Assetbar. This used to be a funny, nay, hilarious place. At its peak, there would be at least a couple of comments every strip that would make me laugh out loud and would, in turn, inspire me to make comments that others sometimes found amusing. Now, instead of hilarious nonsensical exchanges and displays of hastily photoshopped buggery, I am mostly treated to factual discussions of daily minutia. More and more, reading and posting feels like a chore that I just do out of habit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize that I more guilty of this than most, particularly when it comes to philosophical or sociological debates. But surely there is some difference between discussing a matter of human significance and splitting hairs over some mundane details of daily life, or simply sharing aspects of your personal routine without making any larger point? At least so I tell myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize that no one has a duty to perform for my or anyone else's amusement, and for many of you, this is just a place to talk to and connect with real people rather than someone playing an Internet character role. That is fine - I feel the same way! But there is a happy medium to be found, and talking to real people is much more interesting when those real people are also being entertaining. I've noticed that as the mundane exchanges have increased, they seem to actually be driving away the star posters who brought us so much mirth, either because they don't want to scroll through a million comments, or because no one is giving them any good set-ups and they don't feel like joining the latest discussion of people's personal teeth-brushing methods. This is not a good thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is inevitable that old posters will move on, new ones will appear, and the tone of Assetbar will change. I just think it would be good if we could all remember how funny it used to be, and make a conscious effort to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, perhaps by creating the slightest filter between your brain and your keyboard and stopping to think for a moment, "Is this funny or interesting to anyone? Is it worth the space that it will take up on the page?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will now proceed to follow my own advice and shut up for a bit.

      You should know by now that you're probably one of my favorite people on here as far as "people who I think are cool in real life". But I'm just saying that in the context of this forum you and several other people who I personally think are okay or even rad as individuals unwittingly contribute to an overall situation that, when everything is combined, is maybe not the most desirable. Call it the tragedy of the commons, if you will.

      I saw the point that was being made and while I had criticisms I decided to keep them to myself, look things over a bit, do a bit of ruminating on how I feel with a slightly fresher perspective, and try to see how I could maybe find a solution that works for everyone. <br/>

      I think the problem with (and also the best part of) Assetbar is that there is no real rules, like a traditional forum. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the most part it is self-governed, complete with a system of Chubs and Lames. It's more a social experiment by Onstad than anything, which is probably why we get more "HAI GUYZ THIZ IZ MAH LYFE" posts recently instead of "OMG IN PANEL THREE THAT IS A THING I SAY ALL THE TIME WTFFF CHRIS!"

      I could have easily posted that in reply to any of the other hundred posts where you do the same thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like I said, I think you do make great posts sometimes. I didn't call you out by name, and I just said we should all try to cut down on unnecessary posts. But your response to this whole discussion has been to get overly defensive and go down the page responding to everyone by doing a reductio ad absurdum of anything they were saying and forming it into a single sarcastic sentence in all caps. I imagine that if this were in person you would be saying these sentences in the kind of voice in which people say "DURR LOOK AT ME I'M ___" It's the kind of thing a third grader would do. By responding in this way, you've basically confirmed the very same opinion of you that you were trying to defend against. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Please don't respond to this with something like "OKAY FINE THEN I'M LEAVING" We know you're better than this. Just accept some constructive criticism and work with us to make Assetbar a better place.

      I can accept constructive criticism fine. I don't see how having a livejournal account created so I can talk about my life is constructive. Or being told that saying that we don't have to be funny all the time here is ignore worthy is constructive. That is destructive to the core. That is downright insulting. <br/>

      Deimosrising? Man, that guy was decent at best. He just happened to be the first decent poster ever on Assetbar, so he got crazy respect by default. I mean, go back and look at some of his posts. He must have got an average of, like, thirty chubbies per comment for basically just for being coherent. He was just in the right place at the right time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I definitely miss Skradley, though. I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One more thing - calling out Theguitarhero and the others for posting too much and then counting Manflesh as a poster who didn't suck really makes no sense, you know. If Theguitarhero is the flu, Manflesh was AIDS.

      I totally don't understand the positive attitude towards Manflesh. <br/>

I didn't read that many of his posts.  Because it only takes a couple of gratuitous irrlelvant homo-erotic fanfic posts to totally turn me off. <br/>

If this were a place where gratuitous irrelevant homoerotic fanfic was expected, I could understand such responses.  But this is not such a place.

      This is something I've been thinking about for a few weeks now. Of course, a big part of the problem, I think, is that spinynorman, drskradley, heccibiggs, loneal, and other classic posters all seem to be gone. Why this is, I don't know (except in the case of loneal and hecci, obviously). Maybe they got jobs, or girlfriends, whatever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But yeah. This place isn't as fun as it used to be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Tough love time, guys: belgand. theguitarhero. sje46. zapatos. I'm sorry, but you guys post too much. Each new strip keeps generating over 1000 (sometimes WELL over 1000) comments, and I'd wager that 500 or 600 of that 1000 come from the four of you, easily. This wouldn't be a problem except that a lot of what you post isn't really interesting. You need to filter yourselves. Before you say something, ask yourself "is this funny? Is it interesting?" or "Does it pertain to the strip?" If the answer to any/all of those questions is no, then maybe you shouldn't post it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's a bit harsh, I know. And I do like you guys. But you really talk too much.

      Well heccibiggs and loneal left more because they were being harassed and less because of the quality of comments here, spinynorman still pops up every so often and so do the other classic posters. <br/>

      One of my favorite things to do on Assetbar was to think for days on how to leave a single post that would get the maximum amount of chubbies and comments going after it. And a lot of people seemed to do the same thing. Nowadays, you can't do that at all because five minutes in, there are 8 billion comments that cannot be filtered through with any version of Assetbarista and everybody has burned up all their chubbies. People are so desperate to get a word in edgewise before being lost in the sea of commentry that they don't take the time to attempt to amuse anymore. Can the genie be put back in the bottle? Probably not.

      yea, i started out with that mentality (single post, relevant, funny, hell of chubbies) and i was doing ok for a while. but then i noticed that everyone else was just talking about their personal lives and it's hard to ignore because it takes up like 90% of the comments. so then i set up a ratio for myself. one just-personal comment for every three entertaining comments. then that dwindled to a one to one... and then probably less. <br/> 
 <br/> 
it's funny that achilleselbow and tekende should be the ones spearheading this effort to de-mundane assetbar posts. if i am not mistaken, both are guilty of reporting numerous details concerning their daily lives, often without any humorous embellishment.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i have always wondered why there isn't a personal message function. it seems like that would eliminate a lot of unnecessary wall space being taken up by responses or inquiries directed towards an individual. a word limit function combined with a comment limit function might also help matters (one 10 line paragraph and 10 comments, respectively, i think would do the trick). i don't want to limit anyone's right to free speech but i simply don't have the time to read through everything anymore. it's not really fair that some people on assetbar have the whole day free to peruse comments while others like myself have only a couple hours of free time a day to work with. to read through all the comments would take all of that free time, perhaps more. since i don't have the time to read everything, why even jump in?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
when i do have the time though, i will post only things that are entertaining to all. i just need to remind myself of this, and i suggest that everyone else remind themselves of this too. when you're being entertaining, your personality shines through anyway. dammit, i've already violated my proposed 10-line limit. anyway. this has just been bothering me a lot with certain people, and i've been feeling sort of like a hypocrite, so here is my atonement.

      I don't think a comment limit would help, because people would probably not post that often. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A character limit MAY be beneficial, because it would force us to work with in the constrains of say, 200 characters? It works well for Twitter, why not here too? As long as we could post images I would be ok with that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the important thing to realize is that we can't have it both ways. I don't think we should force this forum into a box by saying "Stupid comments, be more funny!" but I do admit we need to self-filter. I think when the comics come at a steadier pace this will happen naturally though. I never delved into my personal life until it almost become necessary to do so because there was nothing left to say.

TGH fails to grasp the logical purpose of a post limit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, imposing a character limit would be a Bad Idea. I'm not one of the biggest essay-posters, but I appreciate that often the longest posts number among the best. <br/>

As far as what telescreen is talking about in regards to working towards saying something amusing, I'm sorry but no one here HAS to say something amusing. I'd rather us talk like normal people about our lives instead of having to carefully moderate every single thing we say so it can be "funny". <br/>

      Even if you plan to leave the classy way is to say that you are going to leave in a polite manner and then never post again. Making a big, showy, angry thing of it is... just not a good idea. It represents everything that people are complaining about. I almost don't want to even post this myself now, but well... the point is that I think it could maybe do with being said. You're not the first to do this sort of thing. <br/>

      I'm so bad at giving oral to the ladies that sometimes when I try to do so I accidentally end up giving oral to a dude instead. I'll be going to town and all of a sudden it's like  <br/> 
"Whoa, I think I'm totally blowin' a dude!" and when I look up I check and damn if I haven't just been fluffing some hog and I try to explain it to the guy that it's nothing personal, but I just thought I was going down on a lady because I'm so terrible at giving head and then he hits me very hard and I tend to forget what happens from then on. <br/>

Needless to say if you want to go down on a dude or a lady be certain that you double-check first.

      Jesus, nobody is saying only talk about the strip.  Maybe that is some hidden subtext I'm not picking up on in tekende, achilleselbow, and bixschmix's posts, but all I see is people saying the Assetbar has become a little saturated with posts that aren't really intended to amuse--which is what we were all used to. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While I'm not at all opposed to any of you that have been singled out, I do think that Assetbar is becoming more a social club and less of a humor forum type thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe that is the natural evolution, in which case, eh!  It happens.  I just prefer a more entertaining, solely humorous communication, less of a "here is my life", or "my opinion, solid, no laugh-chaser." <br/> 
 <br/> 
That stuff is really meant for blogs.  On occasion it's totally fine, but that sort of post has become the majority, with posts made strictly to entertain taking the second chair.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
SJE, I did notice less posting on your part over the last few strips.  If I were going to single people out for talking too much, I wouldn't have really included you.

      Ok I might have screwed the pooch on the "talk only about the strip!" comment but someone here has said it, maybe not today but somewhere recently, and it wasn't Asherdan. I know I wasn't pulling that out my ass. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also maybe there would be less social talk that was unfunny if there was actual conversation about the strip. It generally devolves into name-calling and arguments about how much the comic sucks nowadays. I'd rather have a million-comment long thread about our teeth-brushing technique then a hundred-comment long thread about how the only characters we need in the strip are Chucklebot and Blister and that Chris Onstad is a sell-out.

      I'm tired of the "achewood is lame now" comments.  Why?  Because I think that it is too early to tell, and there is a bit bias involved with current comments as opposed to comments written before the invention of assetbar.  And also, it saddens me.

      I expected to be named there but I've made an effort to not post more than like a dozen times per comic in the last few weeks, which is partly a result of finals time but also because looking over old comics, I can see I'm just as bad, replying to things that didn't need to be replied to and not getting responses back.

      The reduction in strip rate is not helping.  When it was 3 or 4 a week, you pretty much had 1 or 2 days to comment on a strip, so it stayed fresh.  Now we're getting into the 6th and 7th days of seeing a strip and there's only so much you can milk from a moldy piece of beef (dead cows don't lactate you idiot) (shut up Stereo)

      I agree with achilleselbow's concern, and I heartily agree with stereo's obervation.  The past ten strips have sat for an average of nearly 4 days! <br/> 
I can't even keep up with the searching for new comments, much less have time to contribute anything of much value.  I've got a couple photobuggeries that I didn't even have the heart to finish, because by the time I got home from work, the posts around the setup were 20,000 leagues deep, and I lost heart. <br/>

      Yeah, a few times I spent a little too long on photobuggery and they ended up lost and alone at the bottom of seven hundred comments, or went up minutes before the next day's strip.  I guess the lesson is to do it quick and dirty (by the way, you seem to know the font used in Achewood, can I has?)

      At the same time, however, if there were more strips coming out wouldn't the problem be similar? We'd all move on to the new strip by the time it was done and it wouldn't be seen very much either.

It's true that people have been mistaking this messageboard for a chatroom or a blog, and that's a shame. Ideally, Assetbar would have a proper forum and a PM system, but it doesn't, so we have to conduct our inane conversations (whether they're about our sex lives, musical tastes, or importing Region 2 DVDs) in public, and inevitably people are going to get bored and/or annoyed some of the time. But if someone's posts  <em>consistently</em>  bore and/or annoy you, just put them on your ignore list. Trust me, Assetbar will immediately start to feel like less of a chore. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To reiterate Tekende's point:  <em>all</em>  posts should aim to be either: a) interesting, b) relevant or c) amusing. If you can manage all three, that's awesome, and you will earn hella chubbies. If you don't even attempt to meet one of these criteria, why would anyone want to read what you have to say?

      All posts shouldn't anything.  Just because people want something doesn't mean that that thing is more moral.  Also, if thee was a forum, I doubt there would be a rule that says "You have to be funny, relevant or amusing".  Because the first and third things I just douchey requirements, and the second would be impossible to mantain.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is a self-moderated forum.  If you do not like someone, lame them.  It is that simple.  No one is going to ban someone for being not always relevant or funny.

      I'm not suggesting bans or even moderation, and I'm certainly not suggesting that it's "immoral" for someone to make a post that doesn't entertain me (seriously, I have no idea where you got that from). <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I mean is, many of the comments being posted here would be better suited to a chatroom or an off-topic forum, where threads about our personal lives etc. could be allowed to die after the conversation is over (rather than remaining permanently attached to a webcomic about talking cats), and could be avoided altogether by those who aren't interested.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I gotta admit, " <em>all</em>  posts should..." was a little strong. I don't mean to come wading in all claiming to be the Voice Of Reason. But I genuinely don't see why anyone would come here to make posts that aren't at least somewhat interesting, relevant or amusing. As I said, this isn't a forum or chatroom, where comments are ephemeral and quickly forgotten. If someone just wants to shoot the breeze and chat about whatever's on their mind, there are better places to do so.

      I think the problem is, as someone mentioned, there is only so many funny relevant things one can say on a strip that is up for more than a week. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have never started an irrelevant conversation, I usually try to post something "irrelevant" or "mundane" on such a conversation already in progress.

      I think it boils down to: is this a community for people who like Achewood or is this a venue solely to discuss the current comic and things relating to or inspired by it? <br/>

People's views on what Assetbar should be seem fall to varying degrees along that axis.

      That morality came from the "should". As I see it "should" either means that if you want to accomplish Y, and the most rational way to accomplish Y is to do X, than one  <em>should</em>  do X.  Or, if the goal is not stated, then I take it to mean "ought" which is a moral statement.  This is what I took it as. <br/> 
I post a lot, I know.  Mostly because I typically don't talk to many people IRL, and I guess it's just cool to connect with people with similar interests to me.  I'm not normally a blabby person; I just open up more online.  I realized I wasn't funny a long time ago, and I'm sorry.

      Remember the halcyon days of spinynorman? he could tell a hilarious anecdote that was also relevant to the strip and then have snarky commentary on the responses to his comment. I used to scroll on each comment section until I found his lit up little section of glory on the page. <br/>

A forum would be nice, but really I think a return to just a little of the self censorship would be nice. Not too much, as some personality has been a nice addition to the commentary.

      I don't know, man. I can't see the problem. This place was never perfect. There have always been the posters who I try to find and the ones who make me want to punch something. The names change, but most of the same roles stay filled. People are always lamenting the apparent departure of this Edwell. He must have had a short tenure that fell in the space of time in which I was on asset-hiatus. I don't remember him at all. But the point is, now we have Hamscout to rock to Photoshop chuckle. Sure, Spinynorman was a good storyteller, but he never made me laugh like Autrepoupee does. There used to be Towl with his love of clits, and now there is Glad with the stupid little shit that he does. Loneal was...wait, what made Loneal interesting? Didn't people just respond to her because she was thought to be attractive?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, as someone else has already pointed out somewhere else here, I think it has more to do with the fact that it's basically a weekly strip now. This is exactly what the boards would've looked like back then had there been layovers like these. I understand that Onstad is busy doing good things, so I don't bitch about it. But this is one side effect of that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for Theguitarhero, Sje, Zappy and (you forgot) Belgand posting a ton, it's not like they're trolls or anything. When I first got back I thought they might be, but I'd say that they've all proven themselves to be human at this point (if not a bit  <em>too</em>  human, at times) and I think they're actually pretty funny a lot of the time. Besides, getting back to my main argument, there have always been people here who just basically blog on Assetbar. Now, as then, if I ever don't feel like reading about them, I just get my scrollin' shoes on. It's easy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end, I think the handface thing gave you guys a taste of something really great that couldn't possible sustain itself and you're all still dealing with that. That's fine. But don't be blue. There are still a lot of good folks here even if they're not all the same ones you remember. Don't forget us.

      Personally, I know I post a lot and I'm sorry and all, but I think you guys are being a little douchey to theguitarhero, whom I think is pretty rad even though he posts like crazy.  I think it was wrong to make him that blog space, for example.  That really is a bit insulting and dismissive.  Everyone here is rad in his own way, except for desert_donkey, of course.   <br/> 
So yeah, I mostly agree with you.  I think that pretty much there was a time where there was a preponderance of hilarious comments on Assetbar, and everyone is bitter about those people leaving and blaming it on the people who post a lot, which doesn't really make too much sense to me.  Blame them for leaving, not us. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I think mostly people just feel on edge because of the slowness perceived lameness of this particular arc.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I am seeing here is similar to what I'm seeing on /b/.  I hope that you guys don't start showing gruesome pictures as "chemo" to ward off the new people.

Take a joke.  Say, or do something that can make you the object of ridicule or scorn, and then don't be shocked and appalled when someone laughs at your expense.

I've been partying for the last few days and have ignored assetbar for the most part, and defintely didn't read through this whole drama, but I think what rowboat says here corresponds with my general experiences with assetbar; plus he sums up Glad perfectly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was here for the handface thing (though I abstained from participating), but it's weird to think of that as some kind of golden age in respect to this current argument.  It was the first ridiculously long set of comments under a strip, most of which were just "ok i'm posting my picture!" or "you're hot!" and a bunch of other not terribly interesting, relevant or funny comments.

      It seems to me though that, as we lost the more interesting people (I think I came in at the tail end of that spinynorman reign because I remember stories from him), we also lost the most annoying of trolls.  Now we have desert_donkey and gladi8orrex (however it's spelled) but I have them on ignore, and AIU too in case he makes a comeback.  Silver lining?

      I do, in my defense, try to work for the laughs as well. Sometimes it comes, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it takes some discussion or effort to get a place to make the funny happen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the same time it can't be jokes all the time. We need character development to make better jokes. Jokes that cut better and deeper and reveal the truth of the world within them.

      I can't say I'm not happy about that.  While people mention sje and theguitarhero as annoying, they post in a totally harmless way: references and anecdotes about how boring or loserly they are, which I know I can relate to (I'm the same age as them anyway and probably much like them; kindred spirits, if you will).  But zapatos just comes on and tells the world how her ass-fucked a girl, and that's just a dick thing to post.  Not all the time, of course, and he's not without his merit, but when he posts something about how much he parties or how much he benches, it makes my internet blood simmer. <br/>

      I see where you're coming from, but the mood is very different. It perfectly captures that "late night, driving with friends" feel. Or so I presume if I had friends or drove any more. <br/>

This one is good and amusing, but I worry about its lasting impact. The short little bits seem more like throwaways. They amuse briefly and then are gone and forgotten.

      I think it is two lengthwise pages. Look at the design and you'll see where it splits. I found that I could scroll down and have two pages roughly. They're just connected to each other. <br/>

I still think billing it as "two pages" was a tad disingenuous though.

      Basted, I believe, can be proven to be the absolute best way of preparing eggs for breakfast on their own. <br/>

This is only for solo eggs.  <em>Huevos rancheros</em>  or  <em>huevos con chorizo</em>  are also very amazingly delicious, but those belong closer to the level of discussing egg dishes.

      Sorry to double-post, but earlier I thought about replying to this, but I hesitated and was cowed by the complaints going on so I clicked "Cancel" and made it go away. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now others have posted along with it so I felt that maybe it was OK if I also did. Looking back though I feel guilty and bad about doing that because I feel like it's just part of the whole "contributing to the problem" thing that people were going on about and, well, I got called out specifically so I'm trying to be a lot more careful and am definitely far more worried. <br/>

      Feel free to do as you will. I just think to myself "Dude, this is exactly the sort of stuff that people are complaining about. Maybe I should mention it to him gently so, y'know, he realizes." <br/>

I was one of the people called out on this too. I just don't want people to get pissed at you is all. <br/>

Honestly it doesn't bother me in the slightest. I would probably have joined in. I'm just trying to help lower the level of tension around here.

I could see the value here though. It serves a purpose and then when one wishes it for a masturbatory aid it is convenient to additional supplies.

      Dadfrigginggumit. I made two or three posts this afternoon pertaining to the Great Assetbar Purpose Debate, and none of them showed up. I'll try here to sum up what I said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. Several posters are alluding to thinking that I said all comments need to pertain to the strip. I did not say such. I said comments should try to be interesting, amusing, and/ <strong>OR</strong>  relevant to the strip. I don't want to see this become nothing but "oh man I love Ray's expression in panel three". <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. I'm not saying that theguitarhero, sje, zapatos, or belgand should leave. Stay if you want, or don't. For the most part, I like you guys. You have plenty of funny things to say. Unfortunately, it seems like lately for every funny thing you post, you write five more comments that aren't particularly interesting at all. I'm sorry if you're offended that I called you out by name, and I'm sorry if you got the impression that I think you guys are the heart and soul of the problem--you're not. You're part of it, but by no means all of it. (Obviously a big culprit is this one-strip-a-week update schedule.) (I'm also not considering myself blameless, but it's hard to judge my own performance.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, and theguitarhero? You're being a turd now. No one told you to leave. No one said they didn't like you. Quite a few people have told you that they do like you and want you to stay, but you insist on acting like a persecuted martyr. Leave if you want, but don't blame any of us. <br/>

      I definitely agree. I did this myself back in high school when I switched schools after my freshman year. I only moved within the district so it wasn't that big of a deal, but when I showed up mid-year for debate or something I would still hear the occasional thing from people about where in the hell I went.

      I think there should be a modification to the formula to take into account when a picture is too big to fit on the screen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Specifically, when, as in this case, it is  <em>pointlessly</em>  too big to fit on the screen. <br/>

That is the only reason I lamed it.  Had it been, say, only 75% as large, I would have looked at it, and just gone on.

      I meant to get the thumbnail's url, not the actual image's-- my bad.  But notice that the formula takes this into account with its S variable.  If I'd posted a way smaller version, say one only 50 pixels high, I'd score a .116-- not bad.  See, the stat should read kinda like batting average, I figure, except for the scores on R, H, and I are not only totally subjective but also without any actual scale to them.

      Ah.  I was at least correct in guessing the show it was from. <br/> 
Also, is genitalium a real word?

      Good to know the origin, although the thought of all those severed dicks makes me cross my legs real tight.  "Great hot dog, sitting right on top of two soggy walnuts, blood flavored."

      Oh my. In panel 2 she fondles Connie under the table as she mocks Ray. Ray's looking so lame he may as well take the prime rib to the curb, call it a night, and go edit Wikipedia entries for individual Transformers.

      Hopefully, this godawful storyarc is over. Redguy's comment gave me a bigger laugh than the actual strips. Let's call your comment about Wikipedia entries the conclusion to this story, so we can all say, "Well, at least the ending was funny".
