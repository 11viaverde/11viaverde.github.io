      Most of the Fuck-You's will heal on their own, one however ricocheted off of his pelvis and lodged in his manhood. The only way he can recover is to grow a pair, all we can do is encourage this to happen, his body must do it on it's own for it to take. We've assigned him a busty nurse who will act interested in an indirect manner, and proscribed him 590 ccs of wild turkey a day. While he is on rest it's recommended that he only watch Walker Texas Ranger (WTR) or other hyper masculine shows from the 90's or earlier. If you insist, more recent manly television could be substituted, but due to new regulations the legal limit was lowered in 1998 and again in 2002. Once he shows signs that he is starting to grow a pair he needs to get started with a real job immediately, at that point it is imperative that no one mommies his bitch ass, when he complains I recommend either repeating his words in the voice of a crying autistic person, or at the very least, sticking out your lip and going "A BLOO BA BLOOO".

      i feel like that's a little too different to be a mondegreen.  i think that's just a misheard lyric, plain and simple. <br/>

      You know, she's damn right about mondegreen's being somehow better than the original lyrics.  Even Seal pointed that out (explaining why there aren't lyrics in his liner notes) and Lord, I have no idea wy I remember that.  All I know is that when I misheard a line from E&TB's 'Nocturnal Me' I heard 'knocked-up dreams of starry skies' which, by the by, is the best lyric EVER EVER EVER.

      I have a film degree: <br/> 
Should I feel depressed about not using said degree I can buy a beaten up chair and shoot an indie film about it's neglect and subsequent retirement to China.  <br/> 
After it makes the rounds I'll be forced into adding softcore porn by the man to make it more sellable. Following years of depression I end up at a mall and hear someone say "I know you!".

      Nah, I've worked in a bank for a while when I needed the money (...as opposed to now. Yeah), and I had a chair, but it still sucked because we got abused on a minute-by-minute basis.  Although, perhaps the fact that we had chairs helped us survive.  But then, I quit that as soon as I could.  Ah well, fuck them.

      At my job (where I have a chair), the other managers and I are instructed never to make emotional decisions or statements around other employees. When the urge arises we are to walk to the supermarket down the street and kick a cashier. These are our exact instructions.

      There is basically no excuse for not giving cashiers chairs. What is worse is when all of the other people at your store think you're lame for wanting one, because That's Just The Way It Is and This Is How Things Work and None Of Us Have Chairs What Makes You So Special.

      i agree, though ray as a character is also the one that gave a mentally challenged person twenty bucks saying "hey, kid - no retard should pay to eat".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
upon appraisal, one would think a big portion of those that read achewood are privileged college-age students. but i read this more as the kind of pent-up "fuck everything" that is oft taken out on anything that seems to inconvenience you. then again, maybe onstad is slowly transforming the comic into a megaphone for the bourgeois opressors.

      At my school, we have a lot of this: rich kids who act like their money and education make them superior to other humans. As a homeless man I know once said, "Where were they when I was wiping my buddy off of my face in Viet Nam? They were still shitting mustard! And now they come and throw a half-eaten bagel at me and tell me to get a job?"  <br/> 
The inhumanity which class differences can create will never cease to amaze me.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, what do you think about this fuck-you friday? <br/> 
https://achewood.com/index.php?date=05112007 <br/> 
At risk of further wearing my politics in the manner of cufflinks, I think Pat's first two fuck yous are also undeserved (note Ray's response, in particular.)  <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other other hand, I do tremendously enjoy any variety of Fuck You Friday, so I tend to actively re-interpret them as  more ideologically pleasing commentary. (Because that's the kind of guy I am.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Those are my thoughts. Lame at will. <br/>

      I agree that it is a generalization, and one which many to whom it is applied do not deserve. (I would like to think of myself as a college student who recognizes the humanity of all homo sapiens sapiens) However, the thrust of my comment was that such a generalization is, in my observation, based on reality: there are many people who treat very poorly those who are less educated and who have more menial jobs. This is true of the population at large, but my closest experience with it is with people in college and in college towns. It has certainly been more visible in those locations for me. I would tentatively hypothesize that it stems from a combination of new social dynamics, a sudden lack of supervision, and inhibition-lowering activities, but again, I could quite easily be wrong.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for class, different interpretations of the strip, I'm sure, all have validity. I simply feel that Manflesh's comment that "of the three people ray does a fuck-you to in this strip, the last two of them are working shitty minimum wage jobs that they probably hate," next to Ray's wealth is one which particularly rings true to me, and fits with my observations of certain groups of people who are so embedded in their privilege that they feel they can treat others as invisible at best. Again, I am not running the comic down, I am simply voicing my interpretation of it, and adding my thoughts to ManFlesh's post.

      The thing is, Ray isn't yelling at people who are destitute or lower-class, so much as people who are just sort of "paying their dues" in society. <br/> 
The nineteen year old with the crappy job isn't being derided for being "lower-class," but just for being nineteen. He's not saying that he will never get respect, just that, at nineteen, he hasn't earned a whole lot of it yet. If working for minimum wage wasn't shitty, it wouldn't be working for minimum wage.

      i wasn't trying to label all college students, only the big pricks among them. college is a wonderful thing and if you're lucky enough to go, that's fantastic! i think i was being unclear though when i said something about those who have mentioned their college majors in this thread--i was trying to ask those people if their experiences in college are like the ones i'm describing. i wasn't trying to accuse them all of being rich assholes! sorry that i didn't write that out very well.

      Or perhaps people who feel a bit snippy should double-check their reading comprehension. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Quote (dr_manflesh):  <em>there's been a lot of talk of college majors in this thread: doesn't ray's behavior today make you think of the sense of entitlement (and willingness to say fuck you to anybody who has to work hard to pay the bills) that fratty, college-aged children of rich families often have?</em> <br/>

      Agreed- I think it speaks more to the fact that pretty much anyone in college has seen enough of that particular breed of fuckhead to recognize their characteristic behavior? It doesn't accuse Ray or the readers of being the same, simply pointing out a parallel ripe for digression. <br/> <br/> That said, I have to admit I didn't actually read Dr. Manflesh's post, as I have him on my ignore list. (No malice, I think a lot of his stuff is hilarious. Rather, my sanity has proved too fragile for those fanfic posts of his >_<)

      Pat is certainly the bigger asshole. The problem, though, is that he is so self-righteous and sanctimonious that he would never admit how angry he can get at "normal" people. He would have to transpose his anger in the direction of meat-eaters or the wealthy, rather than really and honestly letting it fly when someone "just doing their job" happens to just totally chafe his sack. <br/>

Ray is willing to man-up and face the fact that sometimes life, by no fault of its own and with the best of intentions, gives rise to Fuck You Fridays every now and again.

      All getting a job with a chair means is that you'll probably gain some weight and find yourself uncomfortable in your shitty office chair and worsen your overall posture. <br/>

Also you're probably making more money, but whatever.
