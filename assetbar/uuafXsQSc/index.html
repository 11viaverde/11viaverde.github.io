      Maybe you've been chemically castrated without your knowledge? This is a common problem these days and many men find that this is done either by business rivals, shadowy government agents both domestic and foreign, and occasionally just friends having a bit of a laugh with you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You should check with your physician. If he says this is not the case then he is probably the one doing it.

      Derrida was a French philosopher who basically invented deconstruction (a pain in the ass literary theory).  Adding the "her" and "he' I think is just a funny way of poking fun at the pretentious people who use it, but there may be more to it.

      The first thing I thought of was the feminist critique of English that claims that the language is so ingrained with patriarchy that we need to start spelling women "womyn."  When my debate team was losing really bad, one of our last-ditch efforts included running a critique of the resolution and the other team's proposal based on its "patriarchy."  <br/>

Never worked, though. Can't say we were surprised.

      Oh man, I want there to be actual etymology whores. You take her back to your place and spend an hour discussing obscure derivations. She charges £20 for Anglo-Saxon or Germanic (fuck, blow-job), £40 for Latin (cunnilingus, intercrural), and £60 for Greek (trichophilia, knismolagnia). Some of them will do homosexuality, but that's half-and-half so it's pretty kinky. <br/>

Then she leaves, and you put the dictionaries away with a faint feeling of shame and go for a shower.

      Teodor's blog today is the best blog ever, I actually drooled out what I was drinking when I read it.  My favorite blogs are ones in which the other characters talk about Ray.  Philippe's entry where he beats Ray at frog jumping is pretty great too.

      In high school chemistry class, our teacher told us that Antoine Lavoisier, a french chemist from the time of the revolution, purposed to blink as many times as possible after being guillotined, and the count came to 17. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Apparently that story is apochryphal, though; other more recent reports (veterans, accident survivors) indicate a possible window of consciousness of about 15 seconds. <br/>

      Here, then, is what I was able to note immediately after the decapitation: the eyelids and lips of the guillotined man worked in irregularly rhythmic contractions for about five or six seconds %u2026 I waited for several seconds. The spasmodic movements ceased. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The face relaxed, the lids half closed on the eyeballs, leaving only the white of the conjunctiva visible, exactly as in the dying whom we have occasion to see every day in the exercise of our profession, or as in those just dead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was then that I called in a strong, sharp voice: %u2018Languille!%u2019 I saw the eyelids slowly lift up, without any spasmodic contractions %u2026 Next Languille%u2019s eyes very definitely fixed themselves on mine and the pupils focused themselves %u2026 After several seconds, the eyelids closed again, slowly and evenly, and the head took on the same appearance as it had had before I called out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was at that point that I called out again and, once more, without any spasm, slowly, the eyelids lifted and undeniably living eyes fixed themselves on mine with perhaps even more penetration than the first time. Then there was a further closing of the eyelids, but now less complete. I attempted the effect of a third call; there was no further movement and the eyes took on the glazed look which they have in the dead. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have just recounted to you with rigorous exactness what I was able to observe. The whole thing had lasted twenty-five to thirty seconds. <br/>

"Yes yes, hello. I'd like to sign up for "How to Slide a Beer Mug All the Way Down the Bar and Make it Stop at the Right Place" and "Decapitation - The Truth". I think these two classes would meld into my everyday rituals and become an important part of my life. Maybe I'll even learn how to decapitate someone and get the mug to stop exactly where their head used to be.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Actually, I have Fridays free too, sign me up for "How to Make a Plane Go in a Loop-de-Loop". I don't have a plane but why the hell not. <br/>
