      Okay I guess my vagina might make it so I don't understand, but why would buying a pregnancy test be that bad? I mean I can understand not wanting to buy "feminine hygiene" products because it is gross and you might be afraid of buying the wrong thing but I would think that if your girlfriend needed a pregnancy test, it would at least be partially your fault. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unless we're talking "I had no idea she might be pregnant until she said she needed a test," but that is a bunk thing for a lady to do anyways.

      Yeah, anyone who thinks the cashier gives a flying fuck about what you're buying has never worked retail.  As the hours go by, you no longer see brand names or even types of product anymore.  Boxes fly across a laser square and a number shows up on a display.  Currency is exchanged.  Eventually you can only see in terms of  <em>how is this latest dickhead going to make my day longer and shittier than the last one</em> ?  Can I pay half with foodstamps, 1/4 with debit, and the last with this bag of pennies?   <em>Yes, unfortunately, you can.</em>

      One time I went to Walgreens to get something, I forget what. A couple of nights prior to that I had had a pretty intense session in bed with an ex-girlfriend of mine, and my neck and chest were absolutely covered with hickeys. I'd been wearing sweaters with long zip-up collars to cover the hickeys, but on that evening I'd left my home and forgotten to zip up the collar, leaving the hickeys quite visible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The cashier had a bemused smile on her face as, not looking directly at me, she said, "Did you lose a fight with a Hoover?"

      when my girlfriend made an appointment to get the pill described I walked with her to the gynaecologist. Several other people were sitting in the main room. The desk-lady asked my girlfriend what she came for...When she replied "I want to get the pill described", one dude, who was there with his pregnant wife, looked at me. The point of this story is : -That- is what a "knowing smile" looks like

      'The pill' is a euphemism for a range of oral contraceptives for women. In common with all pills (aka tablets), it is a small solid object, composed of the active agent compressed with a medium (normally talc or somesuch). It can be coated to aid swallowing. Shape, size and colour vary by type. <br/> 
 <br/> 
No appointment needed! Pill description whenever, wherever.

      Because female genitals are complicated and intimidating enough without being reminded about how many ways they can malfunction or back fire. Imagine if you will a rubix cube you have to complete in the dark wearing an oven glove. A rubix cube that nags and has emotions and periodically sprays blood.  <br/>
