All in all, I'm really not fond of the guy... especially since he insists on being a dick to Philippe in ways that aren't even funny.

      Ray is outlining one of the fundamentals of my world view in this strip.  Most people act like a spider monkey on PCP.  They can somehow look at something and see just one of a thousand myriad details, and then pretend that such a level of cognizance is worthy of praise.  The truth is, dogs can notice one detail out of a thousand.  Try to be better than a dog.

      I never noticed before, but no matter what the zoom is on Ray, be it zoomed out, or zoomed in, his necklace's chain always has the same sized links, making it have more links if it's zoomed in. I'm guessing it has something to do with the software used to draw the characters.

      Ahh, the Catch 22 of these recent strips with long comment threads: it's the new one, so everyone is reading, everyone is posting...the number of comments gets really big.  Thus, people are less likely to read all the comments, and, feeling the need to post, don't realize that their just echoing something said by someone earlier.  Then these redundant posts add to the growing amount of comments, which makes it even more likely that someone else won't read all the posts and just repeat a comment already stated by 2 or more people above.  See also Havenless' comment just a little further down from this thread.   <br/>

They itemize the experiences prevented on his monthly bill.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
More recently, they have branched out to provide rad experiences.  I am too lazy to look that up for strangers on the Internet today.  There is the Achewood version, but there is also at least one real company that does this.  I am also forgetful and indifferent today, so someone other than me can google that if they want to know.

      This turn of events could conceivably be described as a deus ex machina <br/>

However as this is Latin for "the god from the machine", clearly such a being would be smacked with a cricket bat by Cornelius in short order

      I, for one, would like to hear more about Ray's completely trashy orgasm. With whom did it happen? In what manner? Were there any spectators? These questions must be answered!

      I am a teacher. I constantly advise my fifth graders to pay attention. One could only hope they take it to heart and carry it with them throughout life as Ray has done. Indeed, Ray is the student all teachers want to come back to them 15 years later, just to see what happens to those who DO actually pay attention.
