      That would have worked perfectly well without the word "cold", as, for that matter, would several of your other comments I've noticed about the place. <br/>

      Yeah, they barely ever seem to mention the dog though. <br/>

Which is strange, since it lives in the house with five or six of the characters. <br/>

I don't believe it has ever even been shown. The only dogs I recall were the one that Todd abused and the Magreux Dog.

I imagine lengthy scenarios where the bird, returning from a bar late at night, is pursued by a shadowy figure (me) and slowly shown through a series of phone calls and photographs that their family is dying in real time.

      I used to live on a poultry farm. <br/> 
My mother bred chickens for shows, and had an entire pen full of super-huge prize-winner roosters right outside my bedroom window.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
... And the farm was surrounded by a Rookery. Sometimes the Rooks and the Poultry would get in a Sound-Off...  <br/> 
And then the Geese would show up, and the Rooks and Roosters got served. <br/> <br/> <br/> And this happened most mornings. <br/> <br/> <br/> ... But I didn't care, as I  <em>had to</em>  get up at 5:30 every morning for Piano Practice before school in those days. Joke was on everyone else. <br/>

      When I was a kid I had to get up around 8:00 for school. I never slept till 8:00 though, no, I couldn't, because every day my fuckin' sister would get up at 6:00am and practice her violin for two hours in the hall outside my bedroom door. We had a huge, quite, brick house, and she could have found somewhere where she wouldn't have bothered anyone very easily, but no, she contended that my hallway was the only place where the acoustics were good enough for her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To this day the sound of a solo violin stirs up violent feelings of anger in me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess in the interests of full disclosure I should mention that for many years I used to dip her dental plate in the fish tank and return it to its case as a form of revenge. And every night I would set her watch back five minutes. As far as I know though, she still doesn't know about either of those things.

      In my old town, there was a 5:30 train.   <br/>

I no longer live there, but am buffeted about in a constant roar of jet noise and artillery fire from the military base which seems to live down the street.  Also, school here starts and 7:25.  my bus leaves at 6;45, and I have to get up at 5:30 anyways.  High school sucks some furious ding-dong.

      My grandfather owned a rooster when my father was a small boy.  <br/>

It apparently used to wake everyone on the block up at ungodly hours. <br/>

Also, they apparently took it for walks around the block with a piece of string tied around its neck.  They were the "quirky" family from oak park, Chicago.

      I've always wondered if you could actually do that with a chicken or rooster. We used to speculate on exactly that notion, since my dog is such a terror to walk. <br/> 
 But then a skunk came and got both chickens a week apart, took them up on the roof for a meal.

      (Foreword: My mom and her siblings grew up on a farm for part of their childhoods, which is probably why this happened) <br/> 
 <br/> 
My uncle is a lawyer, and when he was going to law school he lived in the Los Angeles area. Outside of his apartment lived a little bird that would chirp incessantly starting at about 3:30 in the morning. Finally, the day before the bar exam, he could take no more. When the bird began to sing, he got out of bed, shuffled to his closet, took his .22 rifle, opened the window, and shot the bird. In the middle of Los Angeles. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When his wife (who grew up in the city and wasn't thrilled about him owning a gun to begin with) asked in a horrified tone what the hell he was doing, he replied, "couldn't sleep." He then put the gun back in the closet and went back to bed, satisfied. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So yeah, my family basically confirms all of the world's stereotypes about Americans.
