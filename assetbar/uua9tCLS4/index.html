      What did I miss here, obviously, something disturbing was posted by someone who is on my ignore list.  I am unable to see what it was, and from the reactions it received, I'm guessing I don't want to see it.  Will someone please provide a  <strong>textual description</strong>  of what you are all offended by.  Notice how I said  <strong>textual description</strong> , I said this because I don't actually want to see whatever it is, I just want to know what it is.

      the penis, in place of the face, has a look of a certain confidence on its body. don't get me wrong it's not the biggest guy on the block, but it has a bit of a curve to it. and a bit of a look of confusion upon it. a <i>confident</i> confusion. <br/>

      I have people on ignore because I don't want to see the ridiculous bullshit they post, but occasionally the responses to the ridiculous bullshit are such that I wish to know what the ridiculous bullshit is.  Not knowing what people are responding to every once in a while is better than having to scroll past every piece of random spam ever posted by the fucktards on my ignore list.

      This is along the lines of the conversation. I recall adding about 5 people to my ignore list. I do not recall adding this person, or all 20 or so names which are currently on said list. How could this happen? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, why can you not see the faint text that says the comment by this person was ignored? Assetbar hasn't been showing me images for a while, so I assume the reason I cannot see that one is due to Assetbar being itself. Is this not the case?

      If you look, there are several hundred names that look like troll names on your ignore list. I found this the other day. I've ignored a total of one person, but see many ignored posts, and am thinking of just unignoring everyone. Assetbar also shut down images, I think I read it was because someone was exploiting the image code to infect the website.

I suspect you would be eligible for federal time in the USA for that (defacing currency), but I'm not positive. <br/>

      Here is some reality:  There are on the order of 11,000 members of Assetbar.  Even if half of that number were bots or people no longer reading the comments, you can guess that there are several thousand people who could lame you.  How many did?  Seven or fewer, I think.  How many people would you actually say you know from comments?  Several dozen? <br/> 
 <br/> 
You have overreacted to a few lames.  Change your lame threshold and even those identities will remain unknown to you.  The VAST majority of participants have made no comment on your assets.  Don't feel bad, a lot of musicians and movie stars make this same mistake: they can make giant hits and 95% of the public has no idea who they are and could not care less.

      No way, I just drove through Speedway today!  Harrowing trip, some sort of...motorcycle convention going on.  Pedestrians to the left of me, motorcycles to the right.  I almost just did a Mannix-roll out of the car,  and let it skid where it may. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I saw something awesome though, so I'm glad I remained in the car.  I had no idea there was a business here simply named "500 Guns".  I know it's a reference to the race and all, but the sign has no indication thereof.  For all anybody not familiar with the Indy500 would know, it is just a place that carries exactly 500 guns at any given time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, some strip club that was in a dilapidated old barn.  Cue John Mellencamp, right? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, Guns 'n' Roses.

      Oh my gosh. That is exactly true of the strip club. Its not sad really, because speedway was never a farming community. That is just a random barn-like building. The Old part of speedway is 16th street and houses are packed tighter than sardines there. It is pretty Insane. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, its yet another race. Not just a motorcycle convention, although it might as well be considering the racing medium. Motorcycles. Its the Red Bull MotoGP. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I try to forget the fact that there is a gun shop in Speedway. Though I wonder what their prices are like... <br/> 
 <br/> 
So are you from within the Indianapolis area or what? Because if I was from like, Plainfield I wouldn't even bother making the trip.

      Ahh, close, I'm in Brownsburg!  I went through Speedway the other day in an attempt to see how/if I could get downtown from there.  Driving is hard business. <br/>

As for the gun shop, I imagine that the price is in the range of 500 dollars.

      Larf! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Driving isn't so hard. Basically you would just take 74 through Speedway to where it hit 16th and that can take you "downtown". But if you need central downtown than you will need to jump on capitol from there. That can take you down as far as the convention center area. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So Brownsburg though huh? A friend of mine got racist'd on in Brownsburg. Then a black cop took the guy who did it away. <br/>

      I'm going to guess he still hasn't washed out the pomade from the wedding. I once went as Patrick Bateman for Halloween and I bought this tin of Pomade which I had to assume was good because it had two vaguely-minstrely black people with Fros smiling on the front. I expected it to have "So good it's racist!" somewhere on it in small, old-timey lettering.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Man, that shit was ridiculous. It was like candle wax mixed with seal fat mixed with whatever gravity is made of. As soon as I took a fingerful and watched a string of that shit stretch a string of that shit like bad queso I immediately thought, "This is probably not something that goes in hair, or anywhere near or in the human body." And I was right. Combing it in was semi-painful, and even though I won a costume contest I was unable to wash the waxy-like substance out of my hair without a cocktail of drano, white vinegar, bottom-shelf vodka, and a child's swear, trapped with a net from the air of a local playground and lightly pureed. They could use that shit to waterproof ships.

Your costume reminds me of a costume I did one year where I went as Tyler Durden.  I started the night in business wear with a black eye and a name tag that read "I am Jack's Halloween costume."  Mid-way through the party, I changed into more Brad Pitt style clothes and spiked my hair with a styling glue I also blame for my baldness.  Great night.

      I read once in an interview that Nick Cave keeps an office where he goes to write and work. He goes there at 9 and works til 5 and then he comes home. <br/>

Also, on the reverse side, there is a picture of him with Nice Pete.   They're on a yacht, but on opposite sides of the yacht.  There is a but one single cigarette (no filter) smoldering on the deck betwixt them. <br/>

      Very, very nice. The Nice Pete pause, the lovable inconsequentiality that is Lyle, and an idea that <i>no one but Onstad could have had</i> (on the Internet, genuine praise can be read as sarcasm; in this case, that's a misreading). This is the perfect strip to introduce folks to Achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cue the Asset Bar Faithful claiming to have attempted Pete's dollar trick, being unable to replicate it, but discovering some other odd image one can procure from currency. Likely anti-Bush (n.b.: most folks find Bush rather unlikable). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cue the Achewood Elite creating another great animated gif (the Achewood Elite, you know who you are, are the real stars of Asset Bar).

      As a woman of distinction, you should learn a little Italian.  The vowels never change, so every word is easy to say once you get it.  Just put the accent near the end and have a little lilt to your cadence, and use your hands to gesture while you talk.  It's fun.

      Oops, sorry! I thought we were at the point where it was ironic to use archaic racist epithets for white people because they actually have all the privilege today? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I hereby solemnly swear to never refer to myself as a mick ever again and to come to terms with my prejudice against the Italian race and its sinister pastagenda. I know that Italians suffer from institutionalized racism every day, receiving lower salaries than their also-white counterparts and undergoing dehumanizing references to demeaning stereotypes such as their love of opera or their vigorous hand gestures. I am working on this.

      If there's one thing I have learned from my immersion in academia so far, it's that everyone in the world is simultaneously sexist, racist, and homophobic, even if they don't know it, and any attempts to transcend it are even more sexist, racist, and homophobic in a way that requires at least 20 pages to explain. Case closed. <br/>

      See, I am the first one to admit that I have ingrained sexism and racism and homophobia, and that I probably always will no matter how hard I try to transcend it. Remember that one time I apologized about white privilege because someone else said falseprophet looked like some cartoon character? But I really just literally don't have any learned racism toward Italians aside from really harmless stereotypes about, like, cuisine. I am not offended when people start talking about Irish people drinking a lot and eating potatoes, probably because it doesn't actually do anything to threaten the incredibly privileged status Irish-Americans have. I'm pretty sure the same goes for Italians. I mean, they even get a mafia!

      I'm thinking this toughguy front is a way to prevent himself from seeing the truth about himself.  He's the girlfriend.  He's the one who enjoys being fisted, and he's the one who lost control and let a pack of basketball players roam over his tender flesh.  I think we need to show a lot more kindness here.  I think by calling his 'girlfriend' a slut, we are all demeaning his experiences. <br/>

 <em>the tests come back positive. shortly after my fate is disclosed to me i accept the offer to merge our facilities with the larger organization. i am called on to lead a rally outside of our new, larger, more prestigious headquarters. i hammer fists on the podium monument is erected within the center's courtyard to forever commemerate my life's work. i no longer work one on one with the children; my strength begins to fain drastically. i sign contracts approving the rights to present my story in the medium of film. i am told hospital wings, church buildings and boulevards are named after me. after all this, the way it will end, my name will live on. i am eternal. i am.</em> <br/>

      Non-Physical and Non-Verbal Corrections <br/> 
 <br/> 
* * * <br/> 
 <br/> 
Level Two:  The next level is a postural correction. This might be  <strong>leaning over the dog coupled with a stern look</strong> .  Some dogs are more responsive to this than others. The postural correction may or may not be coupled with a verbal correction. <br/> 
 <br/> 
* * * <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is important to  <strong>earn the dog's respect</strong>  with clear, consistent instruction and praise before implementing corrections. <br/>

Due to a laptop "situation", I had to send it off to be fixed (a part came loose in the cord/computer connecty bit, for lack of a better term), and before that I was in Pennsylvania for a while with no internets, I tell ya, I was in withdrawal! <br/> 
 <br/> 
So nice to be back!
