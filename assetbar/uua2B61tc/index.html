      Ralph Nader was a huge detractor of the Chevy Corvair, due to it's tendency to lose steering functionality and go off the road when the young drivers of the time were attempting to show off their 'sports' car skills. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When Ford introduced the Mustang in 1964, General Motors oriinally believed that the Corvair would be able to compete with it.  They later introduced the Camaro and related cars.  However, the original Mustang design had front end problems of its own. <br/> 
 <br/> 
These problems were later corrected in the Mustang 2 platform.  The new design was both upgradable and retrofitable into the older Mustang platform, assuming you didn't mind doing the work involved to accomplish it.  This being the only conceivable advantage of the Mustang 2 over the Mustang original, and Pat himself driving a Mustang 2, he likely chose a Nader sticker as a clever way of laying these facts out for everyone behind him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pat really is a dick.

      Not sure, but I think (according to some old Rays Place advice (what happened to that??)) Pat hates barbers because he always gets a cheap haircut and apparently hates how he looks. I don't know, he might have his own reasons. <br/> 
Personally if they had the "honk if you love Jesus" one as a sticker or something, I'd buy it.

      So, my favorite story about my grandfather is one that my mom likes to tell. He was driving around town in sunny Fresno, CA when he spied a car with a "Honk if you love Jesus" bumper sticker. He honked once, and the people in the car figured out he was honking at them because of the sticker and turned around to wave. Then he honked again. And again. The light changed and he kept honking as they started moving. They had stopped waving. And my badass grandfather followed them for  <em>miles</em> , honking all the way.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And he never said a word about it after.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Someday when I am a crazy old lady I am going to pull that kind of shit all the time, and it will be great.

      They all look like the sort of thing you'd run off from a template, and a particularly unoriginal and unsatisfying one. It's a kind of subtle touch, but it totally works; Pat is exactly the kind of guy who would make a 'DIDN'T YOU GET THE MEMO?' or a Calvin Pisses bumper sticker basically incomprehensible to satisfy an idiot wind. The only one that looks like it couldn't have been run off from a kind of half-assed template or bought from a store is 'ARREST THEM ALL'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pat is not just the sort of dick who would put a bumper sticker on his car attempting to condescend to people behind him about Grieg. He is the sort of person who would be  <em>satisfied</em>  by Calvin pissing shittily onto a box with all that on it. Pat is not just a dick; he is white trash with a dick veneer.

      Wow, these are pretty wildly brilliant.  None of these are real stickers?  Shit, I mean, Chris Onstad could probably make some bank on the Nader one.  Same with the phone restaurant and the honk if you love jesus. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Stultifying Compositions of Evard Grieg" wins my vote, though <br/>

(And that thing atmus said about mustang 2s needs to be chubbied more)

      Is it a bad thing that I find myself agreeing with Pat more often than I would like to? Given the way my last few haircuts turned out, I'm wondering if he's not on to something regarding barbers. Also, Trials of Honour sounds like an awesome show, and the Jesus sticker is right on. I'm not going to get into the whole Nader thing, but I was pretty sure Pat would drive a Prius or some such vehicle - a Ford seems pretty uncharacteristic.

      "Phone restaurant" is a wonderful demonstration of Pat's capacity to even be incoherently angry when aming bumper stickers. <br/>

      When startled or threatened, Calvin is capable of expelling ink to confuse or distract his natural predators, such as the stultifying compositions of Edvard Grieg.  <br/>

Of course faced with a similar threat, most of us just evolved iPods.

      Come on Onstad. Where is our Achewood Car Kit, complete with the Phone Restaurant bumper sticker and a "Suckin' Dick Paid For This Van!" license plate holder? <br/>

I'd contemplate even getting the Nader Fish and the Honk if You Love Jesus stickers if I thought people would get the joke.
