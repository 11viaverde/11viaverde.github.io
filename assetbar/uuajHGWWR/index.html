And if that doesn't work you, you can always go back to Lisa, even though she's a little overweight and really wants to have kids as soon as your tour is over, and obviously you're not ready for that stage of your life yet, since you don't even know if it's really Lisa you want and not her brother Tom! Come on, how long can you use that "visiting Lisa" excuse to play Marco Polo with her brother in their above ground pool? Like nobody's going to catch on?

      That female friend is me! That is entirely me.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't eat meat, unless it is 1) a cheap taco from a fast food joint or 2) one of a few certain chicken dishes. Chicken dishes are classified as acceptable or not based on some vibes that I get from them, and not from any concrete system, except that they certainly cannot be cold. I don't like the majority of sauces, and I have more than once asked restaurants to just make me some plain pasta with butter and salt on it. Any dish with too many flavors or too many textures is disqualified (Dr. Pepper is A-okay - I know it has twenty-one flavors or whatever in it, but I perceive it as one flavor). If a meal has more than one component (i.e., a piece of chicken, a piece of bread, and a vegetable), those components cannot touch each other, and must be eaten in whole one at a time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, when dudes see me at a dinner table, they are like, "I bet I have no chance with a vittles bitch as nasty as that." I eat like the main vittles bitch in all the land.

      there is one thing that I resent about my South-English upbringing: I now have overly-high standards for fish and chips, and I have developed an affinity for shepherd's pie, peanut butter and cucumber sandwiches, and sunday lunch. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The two latter items can be produced quite easily, but it is damn-near impossible to find a really good fish and chips in the states

      Way, way, back in the day there was "Picadilly Circus London Fish and Chips" in Lafayette, Ca.  Owned and operated by English folks and the F & C were absolutely delightful.  Years went by.  They sold it to some non-English.  The quality went away, and that was that.  Long gone now.  So sad.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, you are right.  Other than that bump in time, I find nothing special in the Fish and the Chips hereabouts.

      I agree, but whereas we get free dental care, thus meaning we have normal functioning teeth, the Americans pay crazy money for all kinds of aesthetic changes, they go in a lot more for teeth whitening treatments and the like whereas we blow the money on other stuff.

      It's true that basic dental care is expensive enough for a lot of Americans, but saying that rich Americans who appear on TV are the only ones who go for aesthetic changes is ridiculous. They have like $20 teeth-whitening packs at every drugstore, and I promise you the middle class is all over that shit. People pay for their kids' braces to the detriment of their kids' college funds. Having just spent a few months in England, I feel I can say with confidence that the average American's teeth are whiter and straighter than the average Brit's, though I have no idea about actual health, which may be better in Britain coz of your health care system.

      Whiter, sure. Straighter? Not as far as I can see. <br/>

Straightness is an aspect of dental health. Whiteness is not - human tooth enamel is subject to natural variation in tone between individuals.

      I know the food because I'm half-obsessed with cooking.  I know the country because my work keeps making me go there.  Honestly, it's the second nicest place I go regularly (I prefer Switzerland, but who doesn't?)  The British are crazy-nice, don't mind the whole Bush thing as much as most of the world, and have highly entertaining media.  Also, it's beautiful country and great history (which most locals know, unlike my unfortunate home country).

      Here's the thing, I've never actually read the comic, this image showed up one day on the LJRIG forum on Portal of Evil and I've been meaning to see if it was any good since then.  I couldn't find this pic again on google, no matter how many variations of the words "zombie" "baby" and "cannibal" I used so I finally found a torrent with the entire comic inside. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm reading the comic now and its pretty good so far. <br/>

      oh, awesome, I didn't recall it being from the sandman core series, if you're liking it I can't recommend the rest of the series hard enough. It is nice that mostly the individual volumes can stand on their own, but when you see the whole thing unfold it is a thing of beauty. <br/>

I'd wager your local library has it in stock, I also have some of the scans if that's what you're into.

      It is more playing for laughs the contrast between the man's decision making (porterhouse and baked potato with everything ordered in 5.6 seconds of conversation with the waiter) and the woman's non-decision-making.  (She does not know what she wants.)

      Not to sound like an aged hag, but could your food preferences possibly have anything to do with your being still almost a teen?  I grew up thinking plain noodles with butter was gour-may eatin'.  (Cf. "U.S. White Girl* Disease", aided by a home diet of basically potatoes and peanut butter sandwiches.)  In my early 20s, I adventured into more exotic cultinary territory and discovered that the pleasure of eating outweighed my longstanding preference for monochrome untextured foods. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*Except I am sure it is not merely a girl thing. Some girls have a lot food-related hang-ups, yes.  But some boys can be the pickiest eaters you ever saw.  My roommate's boyfriend, who won't wat anything that isn't flavored by a lab in New Jeresy, is a great example.  Think of all the dudes you know who will choose Cheez Doodles over smoked gouda.  Vittles bitch, indeed.

      Oh, almost certainly. I have a singularly unrefined palate, which, like a small child's, only likes very sweet or very salty things. I want to fix this, though!

      I think sweet wines are cloying and you don't want to be somebody who goes around ordering awkwardly long bottles of riesling for the rest of your life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe a mulled wine to start? Or for liquors, hot toddies? You know, the sweet evened out by the spices and a little sour lemon kick. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another favorite of mine was salty dogs. Mmm. Now it is time for bed and I want to stay up and drink. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Otherwise, I think there are lots of very salty or very sweet foods that can be good gateways into more complex flavors. Let's come up with some. Like a reading list, only, you know, eats.

      Sweet wines are nasty, but I've sent many non-wine people along that road and they eventually end up sipping Cab and looking down their noses at sweet wine within a few years.  It's a good gateway, but I've known very few people who get stuck in the door with it.  Your lambic recommendation below is really good too, I've seen people swear by that as a first-timer drink.

      Yeah, I would recommend fruited wheat beer or lager rather than lambic. Lambic has a pretty odd taste. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, it depends how sweet you're talking as far as the wines. A sweet riesling can be very nice in the right circumstances (when it is very hot, the wine is either not very cold or very very cold, and the wine is unusually good) but that is rare.

      You know, I've been trying for several years to get into wines, just so I can look more culture at dinners, and I just can't. Even "sweet" wines taste so acrid after the first sip or two. I've sort of given up on enjoying wine and am working on drinking it without making a "WTF!" face afterwards. That's real class there.

      You are charming. <br/> 
If it's not too weird an experiment for you, would you mind if I gave you some suggestions? Good gateway foods? I feel like I came from a similar place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If that's acceptable, my first suggestion would be the Framboise Lambic, a raspberry beer that does not taste anything like beer. It has no traces of bitterness, or hops, or anything else that makes a beer a beer. It's fizzy like champagne, and sweet, and tastes just like fresh crushed raspberries in a glass of very sweet champagne. Nothing about it suggests alcoholic content except from the label. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, you get to drink it out of a champagne flute, if you want, which is always fun. <br/>

      Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat gets a huge freakin' second from me. I love that stuff. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Others in the Hefeweizen/Belgian White category that you might like if you like Leinenkugel are Blue Moon Belgian White, or Sam Adams Summer Ale, or UFO Raspberry Hefeweizen (serve all of these with a slice of lemon, except the Blue Moon which should be served with orange). If you can get them where you live, Magic Hat's Circus Boy, Hocus Pocus or Single Chair Ale might also be beers you'd enjoy. Allagash White is also tasty. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you can get your hands on some Smuttynose Hanami Ale, do it; it's not anything like the other beers I just mentioned but it tastes like cherries! If you like blueberries, Maine's Seadog Blueberry is good. Also Long Trail makes a good Blackbeary Wheat. <br/>

Whew! <br/> 
I do love me some fruity beer.

      I bought shitloads of this when I was a kid.  I remember going to the BevMo in Oakland with about 8 bottles of the Lindeman's framboise.  Cute checkout girl asks if I'm throwing a party, and mentions how much she liked the stuff, which in retrospect was probably a great intro line, but I totally missed it.  Still, 8 bottles of beer was a good consolation.  Tasty!

I even put it with my corned beef and hash on occasion. <br/>

      Just as a personal rule. if it's not on the steak when it's grilling (salt, pepper, garlic, maybe some lime on a strip or skirt steak) it doesn't go on at all (exception for mushrooms). Basically, ketchup goes on burgers and not much else, I feel that even fries are better put with mustard.

      ive gotten into the habit of brushing on a mix of Sriracha and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce while my burgers are cooking, and after doing so it is essentially unnecessary to get any sauce up in (with an exception, perhaps, for a very mild and basic mayonnaise for extra moisture). Bufalo Chipotle sauce also works wonders with basically any cut of beef, ive found; haven't tried it with steak yet (mostly out of incredible respect for steak).

      I have found that the key to a good burger is to add minced garlic and onions, a tablespoon of stone ground mustard, some crumbled bread, and an egg. Then you fry them with a little bit of BBQ sauce or tamari. The result is glorious!

      It would be "Jesi" if "Jesus" was a Latin second declension noun, which it's not.   It would be "Jesodes" if "Jesus" was a Greek third declension noun, which it's also not.   "Jesus" is just the English version of the Greek version of the Aramaic name "Yeshua," so the plural can be nothing but "Jesuses."

      The dots/marks  <em>are</em>  the vowels! I mean, you don't really use them in regular writing, since by the point you are fluent enough to be writing and reading stuff you have to just sort of figure out what is meant by the context if there is a word that can be either of two word depending on the vowels (I've never heard the marks called any different) For example:[IMGS OFF] means big, and [IMGS OFF] means grew. So if you came across this word in a hebrew book written without vowels (As most of them are), you would basically make the brain connection yourself depending on whether the word is used as a noun or a verb. <br/>

      So whose side are you guys taking?  I think I am actually siding with T on this one - he works hard to create a fancy menu and then Beef bitches about the "carbon footprint" and calls him a prima donna and a vittles bitch within the span of 2 panels.

      Beef has a right to be a bit piqued. That menu is ridiculous. It's like taking a joke too far. Teodor KNOWS that Beef comes from a poor background. No need to make his wedding any more uncomfortable than it already is for the poor guy with a bunch of fancy crap he knows Beef is going to have trouble with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, Beef's response doesn't make any sense whatsoever. He's a guy who eats  <strong>Hormel Chicken Thighs in White Gravy.</strong>  That has just as much of a carbon footprint as any other food, probably more. Then he gets ridiculous about the whole thing with the whole vittles bitch slam.  <strong>What the hell, Beef.</strong>  This is not optimal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Overall: undecided.

      I gotta disagree here. What the hell, Beef. I grew up kinda poor too, which is exactly  <em>why</em>  I jump at the chance to stuff my face with fancy food (as long it's the kind that has meat in it rather than some vegan arugula bullcrap). You don't "understand" food, you freakin' eat it. <br/>

      They're both being douchebags, which is interesting because I have heard lots of different comments on assetbar all offering different candidates for which character "is" Onstad. Some have said Roast Beef, others Teodor. Now I try to avoid this line of critical argument, but it's possible that Onstad puts a little bit of himself into all of his characters (some think that this is what all writers do inevitably) and what we're reading is an inner anguish put on the page. But again, I don't think psychoanalysis of the writer through his characters is credible criticism so I'll get off that point.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As a dude of relatively moderate Circumstances there are often times when I am left bewildered by the references in the comic, and am thankful for posts like those of hedonismbot up above. I still have no clue what an Alpo Bar is and as of writing this I don't care enough to find out. But I can see through those unfamiliar details to the characters underneath and I am certainly worried that Onstad will follow one of Kurt Vonnegut's 8 rules of writing fiction and take Roast Beef to school in the car of pain.

      I think finding Onstad through the characters is an interesting way of looking at the characters.  For my money, it's T that is the closest--he's mopey, but not clinically depressed, came from a comfortable background, has good ideas and is creative but not to his own satisfaction, etc.

      I'm more with Teodor. I think weddings should have plenty large carbon footprints.  On the other, cut Beef some slack because getting married is stressful, especially with his family background.

      I really dont know what the stuff on the menu is or if the areas are even famous for the foods theyre associated with. <br/> 
Like, does Nazareth really have great almonds? I figure it would be more famous for Jesus, and stuff.

      Almonds seem associated with Nazareth in my head, although I have no idea why. I don't think they taught us principle exports of the Holy Lands in Sunday school. And the Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan is famous for very high-quality fish, although I don%u2019t know how Teodor expects to import it. Myceanian beef and Welsh Lobster have me puzzled.

 <br/> 
In addition to this there are a handful of things that are so cool that people think they can be cool for saying they aren't cool, some of which follow: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nirvana <br/> 
Pulp Fiction <br/> 
The Original Star Wars Trilogy <br/> 
The First Matrix Movie <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you meet someone who says they hate these things, know that irony has crushed their soul, and there is no fixing them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some of the bands I mentioned don't get links because their videos and live performances were so self-disgracing that it completely ruined the actual music.  I didn't even go into the indie bands, bands from as far back as the 60s, bands which were awesome until they broke up, or have continued to be awesome to this very day, and rap.  I didn't provide links to every one of the movies because I couldn't find scenes for all of them that weren't big spoilers.  If you are ever a lead singer in a band, you should act like  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101017235413/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zhaSnNQ9hw">this</a> . <br/>

      Historically Greeks only got meat when they sacrificed. <br/> 
Otherwise it was fish and bread mm-mmm. So eating beef all the time, shows just how god-fearing yet badass (I mean where are the cow's coming from eh?) the heroes of the Iliad are. <br/>

Personally not read it, though I did flick through the Odyssey (flick said with greatest irony) recently.

      The Iliads a bit of an anomaly, given that it depicts an aristocratic society in an imagined bronze age, for example despite the coastal nature of the greek camp, they never go fishing or are mentioned eating fish (this was Homer's crazy way of saying it was long ago), also the homeric heroes spend any time not fighting, either feasting or sacrifice, at one point they even throw a pig into the sea as a way of sealing a pact. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Iliad's well worth a look, i'd recomment a prose one though, theres only so many things you can ryme "pumjesticles" with.

      I am fully aware of the anomalies. The introduction to my translation of the Odyssey almost put me off reading it, it being a good half of the damn book (including the post-script by another waffling academic). But it mentioned both Iliad scenes and Odyssean scenes. I do think you have to treat them both a bit like 24. Like, when do we ever see Jack Bauer on the crapper. <br/>

(also, 24 is a 45 minute show without ads.... so theres 6 hours unaccounted for every series)

      Whose translation were you reading?   I personally can't stand Lattimore.   He tries to imitate in English as far as reasonable the syntax of the ancient Greek, which just makes for confusing sentences you have to read two or three times over.   I much prefer Robert Fagles' translations - they're more straightforward, and preserve the power of the text through simplicity instead of long-winded metaphor.

      I'm most fammiliar with E.v Rieu's prose translation (penguin classics edition), I've heard Fagles' one is meant to be good though. <br/>

A good introduction can really help with the text, particularly with all the technical stuff, but i know what you mean about a bad introduction. Not tackled the Odyssey yet, just did a course on Anicent greek literature so I'm having a break from anything thats over 2000 years old (except for Exodus,which i have bloody exam on tommorow which shan't be too fun as Exodus is largely a book about furniture)

      Okay, since I'm a reasonably know-it-all-asshole about food, and I haven't done many good deeds, I'll throw my view on what the fuck these things are.  First off: the locations.  It's a thing among pretentious restaurants that they tell you where the food comes from, as though you know good locations from bad.  Second: the quoting.  It's a thing that people 'reinvent' concepts in food by using something in a totally abnormal technique.  I'll explain it in three. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Three: The hamachi 'ravioli'.  Hamachi is a nice Japanese fish food enough for sashimi (raw) service.  He's saying he will shave off two squares of hamachi, then serve a quail yolk on the inside of them (taken from a recent Iron Chef I bet) and seal the edges, making a sort of ravioli.  Cook quickly, then squirt some mousse made with chives and fish eggs (a Wolfgang Puck thing) and serve in a one-or-so bite dish.  This would not taste good in reality. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Four: the 'prosciutto'.  Prosciutto is made from cured pork, and he says he'll do it with duck (hint: not fatty and too red for great curing).  He'll serve this with a mashup relish of peaches and Basque flavors (paprika maybe?)  On top of it all would be a VERY sour vinaigrette (Yuzu tastes kinda like grapefruit).  The texture of this dish would be awful, and he would be slapped for calling it a salad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Finally: the duet.  Beef and lobster are a classic, if overrated, pair.  The barigoule is a slow-stewed artichoke dish, and braised almonds just means almost cooked slowly in a flavorful liquid.  The stew and almonds might be okay (never done those together), but would have little to do with the beef and lobster. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All in all, this is Onstar making fun of pretentious food.  He's spoken against it in the blogs, and this is EXACTLY the sort of shit a 20-something protochef would cook up to prove himself.

      Yeah, you're missing something. Molly is really bad about paying down her debts, evidenced a couple of strips back when she borrowed 50 bucks from Teodor to buy three fresh lobsters from the Stop & Shop. Teodor has been trying to collect ever since, but she keeps trying to skate on it. This is just a little dig, his way of gently getting back at her, because she "welshed" on the lobster. <br/>

      Look, I am trying to cut back on responding to inane internet dipshits but its important to me that you know that you are just as annoying as anyone else who whines about what they think the rating should be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Onstad doesn't care what people rate his comic as.  Know how I know?  Because I don't care what the rating is and I am not a little kitty cat with a nebulous pink fart for a brain, and neither is Onstad.  I barely ever rate the strips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So the next time you think the echo chamber of internet retards needs input from the wind tunnel of vacuous, comic-strip-rating concerned lurkers, take a look in the mirror and recognize your over-prominent forehead and bugged out eyes as indicators that the internet doesn't need to hear from you. <br/>

      Was that a huge slam on Edwell out of nowhere? I can't really tell. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As a rule of thumb, Assetbar starts to suck the moment that it becomes self-conscious; that is, when it becomes the main subject of conversation rather than merely a forum for conversation. Just as the majority of mainstream media coverage is now devoted to what is going on in mainstream media coverage, so Assetbar risks being dragged down into an infinite morass of self-reflection and becoming mere simulacrum. This is precisely the goal of trolls who have no interest in the things most people were originally talking about and so have continuously tried (successfully, it seems) to draw attention to the medium itself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, a community of any sort is at its strongest when there is an assumed cohesion that does not have to be made explicit. For a brief while we could implicitly assume that most of us were (for the sake of rough description) reasonably intelligent 20-30 somethings who were somewhat left of center politically, slightly nerdy but still not complete social outcasts, and possessed similar interests like deadpan absurdist humor, video games, British comedy, and indie/alternative/punk music. There was a general shared understanding of what references people would get, and that no one was going to first-post or type like a YouTube user. But as soon as each one of these expectations is challenged and you're forced to defend it explicitly (and, in the process, become fully conscious of it for the first time), you realize how arbitrary and narrow these expectations are, and sooner or later the whole board is bogged down with arguments over the relative merits of this or that, and suddenly our imaginary house crumbles around us and we're left staring at the exposed wires as we see ourselves for what we truly are - a bunch of strangers arguing over the Internet. But at least for a time we were able to pretend that we were somehow different. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This post of mine here is not part of the solution, it is part of the problem, as most of my posts probably have been many times over. It's just that I've only fully realized this now and am trying to articulate it.

      Well put.  Once the majority of conversation got to be about axes, clits, that fucking Cake song and the adventures of Pumjesticles, the community became something different.  I don't really think it's worse, though many might disagree. <br/>

      Personally I only rate a strip when I feel strongly about it, that is a 5 or a 1, because otherwise I don't want to be sitting there wavering among those other numbers and ultimately going with a 3 which seems to be to be a useless number. The echo chamber is itself an echo chamber of people voting it 5 because it is an Achewood strip and people voting it 4 because it is an Achewood strip but did not make them laugh and then some other people actually rating it as good/mediocre/shitty.

      All this pro-ketchup talk from a pig reminded me of this Reading Rainbow book: <br/> <br/> <br/> <strong>Mrs. Pig's Bulk Buy</strong> <br/> 
Mrs. Pig tries very hard to cook foods her piglets will enjoy, but they never taste her food because they put ketchup on everything they eat. While Mrs. Pig is at the grocery store one day, she comes up with a plan to solve her problem. The piglets are delighted when Mrs. Pig stocks up on ketchup, their favorite food, until they realize it's all they will be eating. They soon tire of ketchup for every meal, and beg their mother not to buy anymore the next time she goes to the grocery store.

      Articles, both definite and indefinite, are among the many things the Russian language lacks (like copula and gerunds). Regardless, the newspaper in question is English-language (run by a burnout from Berkeley who moved to Moscow). So both Pogo's correction of the link and his linguistic statement were correct, but irrelevant to each other.

      Yea, dude. The only time you would say "one codpiece" is if you were actually pointing out that there was one codpiece and not two or three. Other than that, you pretty much have to figure out from context whether you're talking about a particular or general thing, and sometimes it's intentionally vague. Overall it has the effect of sounding more poetic. "Codpiece is put on, mayonnaise jar is opened." <br/>

      I might be reading way too much into this comic, but I wonder if Tedor made that menu subconsciously knowing that it would go against the grain of what Beef wants, and then he jumped at the chance to make a mountain out of a mole hill, because subconsciously, under the surface, there is this conflict between Tedor and Roast Beef whereby Tedor wants to bone Beef's fiance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or maybe I'm reading too much into this...  But then again, I've been going back and re-reading strips, and man, this comic can deliver one-liners sometimes, and other times, it really is that deep and premeditated...

      Before I get the chance to regret this post: <br/> 
I waited for so long to be among the first of viewers and assetbar posters, then I forsook my duties for much beer and vodka/mountain dew. Now I am behind the times, and I would almost regret this decision except for the fact that I have had many Good Times in the real world that is not contingent upon internet updating. <br/> 
As much as I loathe the fine flavors of mountain dew, it is a good choice for those who want to be drunk and awake simultaneously. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My feelings on my own asset will be negative once I'm sober, but the hell if ya'll care since I ain't got no sense of social sense anyway.

      You know how when you approach a small animal, like a squirrel or a weasel, that has found some delicious food, and it wants to run away from you but at the same time eat the food? It will dance madly around the morsel, eating as fast as it can while still trying to keep out of your imagined, horrible grasp. <br/>

This is the process Beef's mind goes through when considering both carbon neutrality and a cammer 427. He can't bear to part with such a burly and manful ride, so he takes hell of effort elsewhere to offset its prodigious emissions.

      <strong>PLEASE EAT HEALTHY</strong> <br/> 
I am shocked and appalled at the dietary tales being told here.  Carbs and fats, no veggies, no minerals, no vitamins!  The long-term damage being done to your growing bodies saddens me.  Please try to at least chug a V8 now and then, and try a salad, too.  If nothing else, take a multivitamin with your rice and ranch.  With the proper diet, you can become a randy, disease free 59-year-old like me with the mind and energy of a late adolescent.

      I got this one.  The fat in milk is pretty much the worst fat you can imbibe.  The small amount in whole milk is still significant due to the awful nature of the lipids themselves.  Further, at your age, you really shouldn't be growing much anymore.  You need to drink plenty of milk, as osteoporosis is a concern you should deal with early, but growth is pretty well finished. <br/>

      This reminds me of two things: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. A story I read in elementary school in which an American military person during, I think, WW2, had a date with an Asian girl. The man spent days learning to use chopsticks and the girl spent days learning to use a fork and knife. In the end, maybe it didn't matter? I can't remember what happened. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. When my grandparents were young and newly married, my grandma asked my grandad what he wanted for dinner that night, and he told her he wanted chili and rice (I don't know, I guess his mom used to make it?). Grandma didn't know how to cook rice so she called her mom and asked how to do it, but neglected to mention that there was going to be chili on the rice. Her mom's method of cooking rice involved putting sugar on it for flavor. So that evening Grandad received sugary rice and chili for dinner. That particular dinner was not a success, but here I am anyway.
