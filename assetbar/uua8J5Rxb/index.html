      I don't think it's past its expiration date. Take a close look at what you can see of the last digit in panel 3; that loop doesn't look like it could plausibly be the top of anything but an 8, 9, or 0. If it were a 2 or 3, the right side would already be starting to curve in more, and if it were a 6 we'd be able to see the end. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In other words, if it's expired, it's at least a year older than Achewood itself.

      No, no, no, nothing like that. I've just been studying it for the past three years or so. I'm nowhere near fluent. I started taking it because I wanted something more challenging than Spanish, in which I actually am fluent, but it turns out that Hebrew is motherfucking KASHE.  <br/>

      Ford is correct.  <br/>

Have you never experienced a morning in which the first words out of your mouth were,  <em>"FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK?"</em>  The last time I woke up very late for work, I basically broke everything in my room looking for a goddamned belt. I was throwing everything looking for this belt. I'm pretty sure I ever threw the belt, itself, a few times. <br/>

These sorts of things happen on these sorts of mornings. <br/>

      Relax, paperboy. Bet the whole story idea started by noticing just how easy real world examples of the above products would be to confuse, not the other way around. It is likely the MOST plausible part of the strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And Three Amigos was intentional camp. The expectations are a little different. It is actually harder to write something that works as well as that movie does while remaining firmly planted in the most obvious and unlikely circumstances than it looks. Not your cup o' noodles? Don't blame the movie! As camp goes, it was first rate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To the rest of you, I must confess feeling >cough< uncomfortable with Monkeybone making an entrance in comment on a strip about penis medicine. I'm at a loss for words....

      Do not worry, someone with depression would not react so quickly & with inspiration to solve the problem of non-rent-money.

      At the risk of being pedantic, you actually opt out of a class action, not in.  If you've ever cashed one of those $1.35 checks you get with a little booklet of boilerplate legalese from your bank or mortgage lender or insurance company, you have waived your right to opt out of the class and sue separately.  Even though I should know better, I always read those booklets, generally when slightly drunk, and always cash the checks.

      Like a Mr. Show sketch, this strip has at least two distinct turns.  First the gruff customer realizes that it tastes like dog penis medicine and then upon seeing the label determines that it is in fact just a "crazy-ass name" of which he approves.  That is masterful, that is just straight up excellence.

      The set-up and resolution of this strip strike me as a uniquely Achewoodian take on a well-worn sitcom formula. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By this I of course mean dog dicks as a comedic device, as best represented by the episode of Friends where Joey accidentally glues his hands to a rather gregarious Corgi's excited member while trying to build a model airplane.

      On the topic of making the rent, I have found a large mouse - nay, a  <em>small rat</em>  - in my home.  What I need from you all, is to help me decide on the method of the rodent's demise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
- A standard mouse trap that, given its size, may just catch and break a limb, making it go into shock and eventually die from starvation <br/> 
 <br/> 
- The anticoagulant poison that makes it bleed internally non-stop until it creates puss-filled pockets inside it, caused by invading flows of its own blood <br/> 
 <br/> 
- The poison that makes it shit itself to death <br/> 
 <br/> 
- Capture it, tie it up, put on some music and cold shoot it in the face <br/> 
 <br/> 
- Trampoline and a ceiling fan <br/> 
 <br/> 
- Use some kind of dark magic to bring to life a cartoon mouse, which will then ram a stick of dynamite up its ass <br/> 
 <br/> 
- 19-hour Simple Plan Live DVD marathon, eyes propped open with toothpicks <br/> 
 <br/> 
- Scream at it until dead <br/> 
 <br/> 
- Catapult/trebuchet out of town <br/> 
 <br/> 
Voting starts now.

      Something I discovered to my eternal discredit is that if you use poisons - either the shit yourself to death ones or the internal bleeding ones - then poor Mickey will most likely run off behind your skirting board and die, creating a huge mousey oder throughout the house as nature takes it's toll, often with an infestation of insects and occasionally, if you leave your windows open, scavengers. <br/>

      I have some experience in this arena.  I can only advise you on what you should not do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We had rats (big, honking rats) in our house when I was a kid.  My mom got the Have-A-Heart traps, with the idea that we'd release the rats into a field somewhere far from any houses.  (Uh, Biff, rodents do live in the wild.  What do you think hawks and owls eat?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
The first time we caught a rat, I was curious, and I picked up the cage to look at it.  Unfortunately, the trap was designed to work with gravity.  As I tilted the cage upward, the latch swung free.  The rat bolted from the bottom end of the cage and flew out of the raised end with a bang, straight at my face. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lesson 1:  Don't tilt the cage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The next time we caught a rat, I was much more gingerly while carrying the cage.  My sister drove the van out to the edge of town; I had the rat in the cage by my feet, keeping it level at all times.  When we got to a farmer's fallow field, I cautiously stayed in the van while placing the cage on the ground.  I had to reach down pretty far, so I held on to the door handle to support myself.  The door did not swing wide open, luckily, because it came to rest against a fence.  Unfortunately, it was an electric fence.  The instant the cage touched the ground, a jolt of electricity shot from my left hand, up my arm, through my chest, down my right arm, and into the cage.  I jumped and hollered, the rat jumped and made a horrified shriek.  My sister laughed and laughed.  When I finally did get the cage open, the poor creature wobbled away unsteadily. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lesson 2:  Do not use a Have-A-Heart cage and your own limbs to electrocute a rat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Later in life, I was renting an apartment with a roommate, and we ended up with mice.  My roommate heard that the most effective way to catch them was with glue traps, so we got those.  Then we heard this terrified shrieking from the kitchen; we had caught a mouse.  Its fur was all glued down; there was no way to get it free.  It would not be able to eat or drink, as its jaw was stuck, and it got more stuck the more it struggled.  The only way it would stop suffering was if it starved to death or had a heart attack.  My roommate refused to deal with the situation; she said I should get rid of it.  So I did the most merciful thing I could think of.  I put the mouse, glue trap and all, in a paper bag.  I took it outside, and dropped a heavy cinder block on it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lesson 3:  Do not use glue traps unless you are a sociopath or like having nightmares. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Good luck, o Chinned One!

      I will do no such thing.  I Have-No-Heart. <br/> 
 <br/> 
An interesting thing develops in my psyche in such circumstances.  It is strange that this is the only scenario in life where it is perfectly socially acceptable to plan out the painful death of another creature and its children.  I do not deny that I enjoy it a little too much.

I pussied out and bought the blocks of anticoagulant poison, which I strategically put into 5 areas in and around my house - thus allowing me to deduce, via their rate of consumption, where the rodent hideouts/entrances are. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I awake today to find three of them no longer there.  They have been dragged away to their lair. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>THEY HAVE BEEN DRAGGED AWAY TO THEIR LAIR</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Given this level of thought, I surmise I am dealing with an advanced civilisation that, given the age of my house, has existed far longer than I have.  I imagine great underground citadels, blinking with stolen energy.  Possibly  <em>are</em>  the escaped rats of NIMH.  Why they decided to run from the farm in Kansas all the way to Australia is anyone's guess, but I distinctly recall finding a miniature red cape, so perhaps the Frisby's have come with them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I feel no remorse for the royal fucking that their civilisation will endure due to all the blocks of poison they will be dragging off to feed their young.

      The sad truth is, you do not harbor the Rats of NIMH beneath your house. That poison shit just  <em>does not work</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
We once had one of those big Norway rat motherfuckers mooching off us who liked to frequent my room in the basement. We called our pest control service to deal with it, and thus began a comically tragic tale of feral tenacity triumphing over superior technology. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The first method tried was a glue board. I can only say that the board did, in fact, stick to the rat. It stuck to him all the way back up the shelf and into the opening around the ventilation pipes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The next method was the poison. We were assured that rats "ate it like candy" and that the teeniest bite would result in certain, painful death. This shit was like a 4-inch cube of modeling clay. The little bastard would really have to work to get his teeth into it. After a week of still seeing a very alive rat, we figured he just hadn't been eating the stuff. The pest control guy comes to check things out, and there is this itty-bitty chunk of poison the size of a Micro Machines car. Goddamn vermin feasted on it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end, we finally caught the sucker with some long-expired Weight Watchers entrees in a live capture trap, and it was off to the gas chamber for him.

"Hey! ... Where are you? ... Huh?... We need you to show up; we can't do this job without you. Listen, we can't do this job without you. Ricky's breaking down, we can't keep him on any longer. We lost the- we lost the drill! Um... There were guard dogs, we weren't expecting guard dogs. Uh... Yes., please. Please. (beep)" <br/>
