      I just realised that the faces Phillipe makes in panels four, six and seven show how innocent and corruptible he is: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Panel 4: Naive amazement at the novelty of hearing cussing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Panel 5: Identification with the noble rage and catharsis that comes with cussing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Panel 7: Now a seasoned connoisseur of cusses, Phillipe knows cussing as epic as T's when he hears it, and responds with appropriate acknowledgment of its brutality.

Innocent and corruptible, indeed. <br/>

      I will deign to answer that question ('cause I had to look it up, too).  <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em>  by Thomas Pynchon. I feel bad for never having read him. I was in a band called The Whole Sick Crew and I never even got around to reading  <em>V.</em>  Guess I should spend less time doing things like this.

      Wouldn't there be motion lines nest to Philippe's had if he were punching the air?  Like the motion lines which indicate Teodor quivering with rage? <br/>

No lines = No motion = No punching air <br/>

No motion = Philippe imitating the behaviors of the adult he is currently admiring. <br/>

I see this guy being the sort of person who makes slang out of everyday words by cutting them in half. Like, "The communication obstacle constitutes a grave threat for our business. We need to reimagine our goals to produce more gain," he'd say, "The comms obst really brings primo heat on the HQ. The const factor is no good, my man.

*That's if Onstad didn't use a fake name - which would be unlike him given his known proficiency in creating the most awesome of fake names (see Great Outdoor Fight) - however, I would assume the possibility that he used the dude's real name to be higher, given that he  <em>actually</em>  got one of these on All Hallo's Eve, and it was  <em>actually</em>  enraging toward him.

      Yeah, in  <em>Vice</em>  the other month or whatever, there were those pictures of those kids hanging out at the beach, and some company like Lost or something had gone down there with some stencils and some paint and stencilled these kids up, "Hi! I'm some twelve year old girl, look at my sweet stencil! Yeah, I know! I let some sleazy mid-twenty year old halfway down my pants so he could spray this shit on. Hold on, I think that's enough of you talking to me, the people at the company said that I should be careful who I'm seen in public with."  <br/>

It would have been nice to see T down there getting his rage on - instead it was some photographer taking beautiful photos of these stupid kids.

      2 of those things (tattoos and shaving) have already happened. I just want to know the exact wording of that marketing pitch. "Whereas other, outdaded advertisers try to convince people that famous and/or sexy people use their product, we will convince the public to buy our shit by showing that it is a favorite of lunatics who shave billboards into their own heads.

      I love that the recent spate of BBcode cock-ups has resulted in a generational and growing fear of BBcode in general, to the point that we are increasingly side-stepping it, quivering at the thought of the resulting embarrassment of the cock-up.

      When I was introduced to computers and e-mail, I was told it was rude to comment on other people's typos.  I think the same goes double for BBCode.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Did you know that certain characters get stripped out of your BBCode when you post a comment to AssetBar, so proofreading doesn't fix everything?  For example, if a URL contains a search string, the plus signs don't get through.

Is that a righteous otter flipper-fist I see in panel 6?!  Amazing. <br/>

      The otter hand is a complex appendage. A paw with both webbing and claws. I don't know if you could call it a flipper, though. You may be confusing Philippe's hand with the Incan God of neck-ties.

      Comments on earlier posts have referred to it as a flipper, so that is why I referred to it as such.  True, otters rather have paws though.  For grippin' and crackin' those shells open.  Still a-freakin-dorable!

Your mission is to find the ONE person/group out of the 100 something he has listed, who he specifically says "did not do cocaine." The prize is... well I guess all I have to give is one chubby, but there's also a lot of glory involved because this is on the internet.
