      Not Chris Ware because he would probably use Roast Beef if he made a guest strip, as that is his way with the depressions, also he would have displayed a better use of pacing.

Oh, and above, I wasn't suggesting that Woodring might have drawn the strip (though I think I'd like to see Frank in among the Achewood cast, as long as he didn't bring too much horror with him). I didn't notice that the strip was done by a mystery guest artist. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Was it ever revealed? Ware is still looking quite likely.

      I meant to answer St Elmo's question "Has Onstad ever done a good color strip with his name on it?". <br/> 
 <br/> 
The two linked strips have a couple of Ware-y elements, but they look much more like Onstad to me; unlike, say, The Old Cement Bridge. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realise there are four colour strips in a row, starting with Cement Bridge, which is a direct Ware homage. To me, Abraxas seems half-and-half, and the two linked strips seem to have returned to being entirely Onstad (albeit with a couple of Ware motifs). <br/> 
 <br/> 
At any rate, they're good, they're in colour and they have his name on them.

      Dang. Put another tick in the "5 is not high enough" camp. I know it's a cozy little mystery as to who the artist is, but I'd wager that it wasn't really Onstad. Though so much of it perfectly matches his style, I think there's enough here to suggest that this was just a perfect representation of his style. Or... a collaboration? Eh? Ehhhh?

      I like trying to figure out what Cornelius is writing.  I don't expect he'll get far asking Lyle to submit a three-page proposal the next time he wants to create frightening scenes around the house, nor will he care that he's wasting materials for crafters everywhere.  A rare instance where Corneliuse should lighten up (though this is obviously not canon, it doesn't seem to run against it very much).

      I love the fact that there is a bottle of achewater there. Awesome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also I don't think this is secretly by Onstad simply because the colour is too calm. Whenever Onstad has colour it is never this calm.

      Its a decent strip though not amazing when looked at more closely.The colors work and are very nice, however it is hard to figure it out at first what is going on. There are too many odd things going on while the strip has enough mystery as it is (did Philippe wet the bed? What is the deal with the yoink?). Also the letter at the end ruins the mystery of it, it would be so much better if it ended on the note of googly eyes and liquor, we can tell its Lyle from the shadow. But it is "drawn" well and the idea of going around drunk one night characterizing everything in your house with googly eyes is quite entertaining. All in all an very interesting strip though not on par with the great Achewoods. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hopefully that helped kinda

      Actually I think Cornelius' letter is the icing on the cake, in that it not only adds familiar Achewood charm to a foreign strip, but shows Mr. Bear with those eyes glued to him, which I think is a riot. <br/>

      I know people think this and that is cool, eyes on Cornelius are funny.  <br/> 
But I get a bit serious with comic reading sometimes though as I make them and I try to figure out how a strip works/doesn't work, overall this strip inspires a confusing humor that is just beyond completely getting what is going on, the last panel gets rid of this, I would prefer that it had not.

      I like this strip, but to me the letter is the weakest part; I don't think "submit a three page project proposal" is a very Mr.Bear thing to say. It's more of a Pat thing to create false systems of authority, Mr.Bear is quite the opposite, he cuts right through bullshit. Still the basic premise and artwork are great.

      The deal with the Yoink is that the cord to the glue gun got caught on the door, causing an already unstable Lyle to fall to the floor and pass out, and his bottle of Achewater to land... wherever the hell it is in the next panel.

      Not trying to be a prick, Tekende, but I only lamed you after your second comment, because even a cursory glance through the other comments offers a slew of reasons why people enjoyed this strip. Personally, I enjoyed it because it blends the completely plausable notion of Lyle being a drunk prick with a prank that one would not associate with the style of Achewood- it is the blend of an outside idea with a certain level of familiarity that makes for a great guest strip, to me. Many others have left better reasons in their comments. <br/>

On a seperate note, I am wondering if anyone else thought of 'Beauty and the Beast' at panel two?
