      Thanks for the tip on the spaces, and for the corrected version.  <br/>

For the record, I just kept the default text because I like how it says 'this is a link'. But on some level I may have known and had given up already maybe.

Double-checking - the original link actually uses plus signs to represent spaces, and assetbar messes up the conversion. <br/>

so far I have gotten it so when anyone mouses over my avicon and my status is displayed, what happens is that user automatically rates the strip as a 999999 (which shows as a 5) and also the user automatically lames the above comment by achilleselbow.<br/>
it was a real bitch getting it to work without crashing the browser in an endless series of recursive redirects. but I put in that effort for you guys. because I am nice.<br/>
ignoring me won't help because I'm going to be creating lots of accounts that do the same thing so there will be ample opportunity for everyone to mouse over affected accounts.<br/>

I removed the rating thing out of the script. yesterday's strip's rating is screwed, but the damage is limited to that. It's just lucky it didn't crash the database with a buffer overrun or some such.<br/>
it'd be nice if you could give achileselbow 9999999 lames, but, it looks like lames are probably more of boolean type variable (lame OR chubby OR spam) so I'm not gonna even try to fuck with that. as it is I'm pretty satisfied with it.

      It's nice to know that all this hax0r fuckery stems from a sort of playful ingenuity rather than any real malice. Lately I've come to think of you as a kid who, on seeing the other children playing happily in the sandbox, barges in and starts pissing on the sand. The other kids flee to their mothers, who mutter under their collective breath about things like parenting and Ritalin. But now I realise that your goal was not to stop the other children from enjoying themselves, because you're still there, sitting cross-legged in the wet sand, building sandcastles. You plunge your grubby little fists into the mud and cram handfuls of the urine-soaked dirt into your mouth. You smile; a beaming, gritty grin. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will try to remember you this way.

I was trying to say that I used to think of wim9k a.k.a. alreadyinuse as a vindictive little shit who pisses in the Assetbar sandbox because he hates the idea of other people having fun. I have now adjusted my opinion and think that he just likes playing with his own piss, which is, to my mind, a far more positive way of thinking of someone. In any case, his antics are only a minor annoyance. Clicking "ignore" is no great hardship. My butt is unhurt.

      well kids it's been funny <br/> 
the following users have conjured up the script which auto-lames achilleselbow: <br/> 
dangelder, liams511, nice-on-water, autrepoupee, rowboat, amp269, utv, fancypants, psykeres. <br/> 
(the comment in question is towards the top of the strip previous to this one.)  okay maybe more people conjured up this script, but only the above users actually had any lames to give. <br/> 
hey but I don't really hate you achilleselbow, I'm just bored.  I know you don't care about people laming you and neither do it, it was just one of those things that had to be done because it could be :-)

      wow - if you log out of assetbar, and then click 'discuss', on the sidebar it will show you the highest rated strips of all time. (if you're logged in it only shows the highest rated strips that you haven't seen yet.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
and it appears we have a new winner: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Highest Rated <br/> 
» The Carcinoslippery Slope. <br/> 
» Ray gets sort of stoned <br/> 
» The Math. <br/> 
» Spy-Ware <br/> 
» The Mountain and the Motorcycle <br/> 
 <br/> 
that's just wrong...  <br/> 
I've reprogrammed the script to give "The Carcinoslippery Slope." a -99999 rating... so if you mouse over my avatar again you can vote it back in the right direction, thereby giving all the other strips their correct ratings relative to each other without "The Carcinoslippery Slope." usurping the rightful place of "Ray gets sort of stoned." <br/>

      okay, I fixed it... damn.. I had to really load in the 9s... -999999999 and such, to get yesterday's strip derated back to the relative obscurity it deserves.  the downside.. it is now undoubtedly the lowest rated strip ever.  I removed the rating thing out of the script.  yesterday's strip's rating is screwed, but the damage is limited to that.  It's just lucky it didn't crash the database with a buffer overrun or some such.  <br/> 
it'd be nice if you could give achileselbow 9999999 lames, but, it looks like lames are probably more of boolean type variable (lame OR chubby OR spam) so I'm not gonna even try to fuck with that.  as it is I'm pretty satisfied with it.  Dr. Manflesh would be proud of the animated gif I think.

      To be honest, though, I'm sure that the premium editions probably aren't that bad.  We're just pretty much neglected.  Poking around the free parts of the susbriber area, it seems pretty nice.   <br/> 
I think that Onstad should keep premium and either have a forum or a better messageboard system.   <br/>

      personally I get, in some but not all respects, a good vibe from the Assetbar people from what little I've seen of them via their industry-facing web site and from what I've been able to infer about them from their assetbar UI.  They seem to have some sort of vision and some technical capability.  they may well be using a secure and stable platform, but their ad-hoc interface to said platform is riddled with classic security problems which they've been sorting through as the need arises.  But I mean, security is a moot point here.  Assetbar is not Face Book.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
You never know, the Assetbar folks might key into a good idea and invent the next twitter, but I don't think that this is something that Onstad should be hoping for...  He needs to invest in technology to interface him with a community (and create that community if necessary), and this is generally a different sort of endeavor than providing venture capital for some folks who think they can/will come up with such a thing...  Onstad should not be in the venture capital business... even if Onstad isn't paying these guys anything, even if Assetbar is paying Onstad, Onstad is still giving Assetbar considerable publicity.  "Onstad uses Assetbar" is a lot of good will that these guys can channel. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I'm gonna criticize Assetbar, I'd say that these guys are trying to invent the wheel, and while this particular wheel may not yet be fully invented, it is quite probably a sort of thing that is going to spontaneously invent it's self, and it's ridiculous to expect that any given small company can stay on the cutting edge, can keep on the crest of this wave of wild convergence and this exponentially collapsing information float, without falling off along the way...  No... 90 percent of startups like Assetbar are destined to be bit players, (if they don't go bankrupt entirely that is) contributing some small piece to the puzzle of the emerging information infrastructure, in many cases being bought up and absorbed by larger companies who in turn only play a bit role... <br/> 
Onstad, as does any artist, needs to stay on the cutting edge, needs to ride the crest of this information infrastructure wave, without falling off.  So really, I'd say that Onstad's strategy should not be to bet his chips on this or that innovative company or futuristic technology, but rather, to invest in developing his presence in the existing players, in the existing technologies, such as they are... meaning develop a presence on facebook, twitter, and whatever the fuck all it is the kids are using to coordinate their exchange of STDs these days. <br/>

      Pat was so worried about Beef (and knowing Beef, Ray) looking at his mail that he had all of his mail forwarded for a month (with a week before and after the trip just in case Beef might be a bit too diligent) to a PO Box. In order to make it look like he wasn't doing this he also subscribed to a number of other "safe" periodicals just to throw them off the trail. <br/>

Beef is picking up the mail that Pat wants him to be looking through, not his real mail.

      Dear Assetbar: <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I was at a barbecue with my roommate and some other people, all of us having been friends since high school, when we got into a theoretical moral discussion. One of the questions that arose was what you would do if you had a retarded child, to which another friend and I both responded that we'd give it up for adoption. This caused my roommate to flip out and call us both selfish, immature, etc. After this he sat silently poking the fire with a stick for half an hour before suddenly getting up and leaving without a word. He's been ignoring me for two days now. Is this normal? <br/> 
 <br/> 
P.S. Having known him for 10 years I am reasonably certain that he has no retarded friends or family. <br/>

      Are you asking whether it is normal for him to react this way when you have a disagreement? You would be best qualified to answer that. If you are asking whether it is normal theoretical ethical discussions to devolve into personal antagonism then yes, it definitely is.

      Dear BiB,  <br/> 
This is probably a stupid thing to say because outside of Assetbar you're in all likelihood a real person and presumably a decent guy, but don't do the thing that we do on the internet, where we just stick to the moral high grounds we think we have because when incorporeal our rationalizations make sense.  <br/> 
Maybe you can try and tell him you're sorry you said something he found offensive and take it from there? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus it may be time you have that talk when he tells you he is your retarded brother.  <br/> 
Also, if this happened anywhere near MacCarren Park, 10 year friendship or not, it's perfectly normal, and your buddy is going through his brooding poseur phase.

      It's quite possible that your friend had no idea, after 10 years, that he would differ so entirely on something he found very important morally. I've had that moment before and have discarded friends for it. Hopefully that's not the case here.

      Really? That's crazy though. I have friends who are anti-abortion and friends who are hardcore Zionists. I have friends who are  <em>libertarian</em> , for crying out loud. I wouldn't be in a serious relationship with someone who differed on basic moral issues, but do you really need to hold your friends to such high standards? Besides, this thing came up so randomly that we could easily have gone another 10 years without it ever being mentioned. Craziness.

      If any friend of mine had voted against Prop. 8 (removing the constitutional right of same sex couples to marry in California after the courts determined that it was, in fact, a constitutionally protected right) I would not speak to them again. I can tolerate some things and various disagreements, but when you vote to take someone's rights away you are just the lowest piece of shit on the planet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This case just sounds kind of fucked up though.

      proposition 8 type of stuff is not about someone being a piece of shit.  It's about someone having their wind warped by religion and culture to the point where that someone's mind is programmed to believe that shit is actually mocha-almond-fudge ice cream with sprinkles and marshmallows.  Many many many people's minds are warped in this manner on a variety of issues (gun ownership, gay rights, birth control, abortion, foreign policy, immigration policy, workers rights, etc.)  Someone's mind may be warped on only some of these issues, so a person could for example support gay rights, or at least not actively support taking away gay rights, yet still have their mind warped on other issues.  This does not mean the person is a piece of shit, it just means the person's mind is infected with a virus.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you don't ever talk to that person again, you are just helping to socially isolate that person from ideas that might, in the long run, be inhospitable to their virus, or that might, at the very least, mitigate the damage done by their virus. <br/>

      Cause self defence by mean of gun is nowhere self defence. You give access to something that can end a life to everybody. I expect few people to have the necessary care to use them "for self-defence". it's way easier to shoot whoever threaten you, or you believe threatens you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, if you have ready access to a gun, you won't take the time to think it over. People act rashly under anger.  It is not a panacea, they can still buy a gun on the black market or use another weapon, but i know that this delay can make some people realise what they wanted to do and make them realise how stupid it is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Frankly, i never understood why you would need a gun to defend yourself in the first place. Unless your a policeman, a hunter , a park ranger or whatever, you hardly will encounter anything threatening.

      I see your point and it's one I've heard many times before, but sometimes you have to give up. Someone who has been indoctrinated into a belief system since birth isn't too likely to change just because you're friends with them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You do what you can, but at the same time you have to be willing to let go. Not to mention why in the hell I want to hang out with these people when we are so diametrically opposed. I mean, we just wouldn't make for very good friends. I'm not planning on inviting Fred Phelps around for a casual picnic or anything under the assumption that he just needs some good friends to change his mind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not to mention how both sides would likely feel this way. Are they going to suddenly cause you to change your mind and realize that you're wrong and sinful? Are they going to somehow minimize the damage caused by you thinking people deserve equal rights? <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's also about the dividing line between thoughts and actions. They are entitled to their opinions, but when they start using them in an attempt to make everyone act like them or they actively oppress someone else who disagrees they have crossed the line.

      Well, in my case, there were other preciptating events definitely. If he was a nice guy in all other respects it wouldn't have been a problem. But he was a racist, used the moniker "gooks" without irony, and there was nothing I could say that would bend his opinion. He wasn't THAT close a friend obviously. I just realised that I don't want to be around people that are that diametrically opposed to me, it's too much work and life is too short. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm just saying, maybe this dude has been slowly slipping out of your friendship circle for various reasons for a while, and those comments were the main precipitation. Maybe he's going insane. There's many reasons and quite frankly me postulating all this shit and drawing an analogy between my friend and yours is probably useless unless you fill out your story a little more.

Elbox, maybe you should assure him that you simply feel unqualified to raise such a child and adoption would be the kindest option for the poor tot (I'm assuming that's your reasoning and you don't just hate retards).

      Dear BIB: <br/> 
Does your roommate nurse grudges in general?  If so then perhaps he should seek counseling;  maybe he is a lunatic.  Irrespective of your roommate's psychological footing, one possibility is that it is starting to dawn on your roommate that he is thoroughly perturbed by one or more aspects of your personality and/or ethical makeup, and,  your theoretical waxing about 'tarded babies was, for your roommate, evocative of these simmering sentiments he is nursing.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
In any case, it would seem that your roommate needs some distance in your relationship.  There are times when one's pattern of interaction with another person slowly becomes a sort of amalgamation of routine and habit with each person's role in the interaction eventually becoming a sort of cliche stereotype of that person.  This happens when one or both of the individuals in an interaction changes substantially, but one (or both) of the individual's respective interests in the interaction does not change.  I.e. you're way into punk music and dick avacons, you meet a charming young fellow who fits the bill, you develop a man crush and you both spend endless hours together fascinated and entertained by your respective interests in this realm, until, eventually, gradually, somehow, on some level, for your buddy, this  <em>isn't enough anymore.</em>   Your buddy changes, and he wants you to come along and explore his new interests (e.g. country western and vagina avacons?) with him, but clearly, this can never be, because you're a dick man, and you always have been, and always will be, and your buddy is naturally upset and mad at you, even though it's not your fault, he basically hates you for being you, and it's basically only a matter of time before he secrets a 55 gallon drum with fertilizer into your studio apartment and detonates it while you're asleep in an honorable murder-dorkicide, because he loves your interaction the way it once was, and he never wants to move past those fun times into a frightening new reality of making new friends and growing up and possibly even growing old and boring.  <em> (Thelma and Louise costumes and makeup optional.  I just didn't throw those in there because I don't know what kinda relationship exactly you're talking about here and you weren't too specific)</em> <br/>

Also, while we're on the topic. I have recently been thinking about the concept of The Least Watched Porno Ever. I don't know what that is, but you've got to think in such a large industry, even the ones that aren't amateur pornos have got to be ones that people just don't watch. Sure, if you're a porn star who's just starting out, nobody watches you do your thing, but when you start to gain notoriety, people start going into your back catalog. But if you never hit it big, in fact, you are the one who hits it the smallest,  <em>then it is basically like you just had private sex with a stranger you don't like for no money</em> . Man that would suck.

      I still think that a viable business could be constructed for porn star fantasy sessions. You pay the company and in turn they let you pick out your co-stars and film you performing. You are then provided with a complimentary copy of your completed film. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically I am wondering how this would not be a way to make prostitution more or less legal. I mean, aren't there some producers who shoot and star in their own films? They are paying people to have sex with them in order to make the film. How is this significantly different from prostitution except they're making money by basically visiting prostitutes? If, instead of payment for sex, if it payment for the filming of your very own porno and you receive a copy of the tape (thus proof that there was a good to be produced and not just the sex act) this would seem to skirt the necessary laws.

      Haven't you ever wondered why most porn is made in Florida and California? This is because these are in fact the only states that make a legal distinction between porn and prostitution. In fact, I'm not even sure about Florida, because there was recently a case where a producer of orgy films was tried on some charges relating to prostitution. So yes, people see your logic - unfortunately, they're using it to push the other way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The moment I lost my childhood innocence was the moment I realized that our society does not consider porn to be a legally protected basic right.

      Yeah, I forget the exact case, but I read some interesting articles on how California has legally defined porn production. <br/>

Agreed that it ought to just be a basic thing. Of course, I also strongly support legalized prostitution.

      At the same time SoCal is basically the ideal place for the porn industry as well. You have the resources and overflow from the mainstream film industry as well as weather very conducive to spending a lot of time outside nude or wearing scant clothing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even if they passed all the right laws I don't think North Dakota would suddenly explode with porn production.

      In Britain it would be the other way round. The act of paying or receiving payment for sex is legal (although as soliciting and pimping are illegal it is more or less impossible to practice prostitution on a commercial basis) but production of pornography would render you liable for prosecution under the Obscene Publications act.

      I thought it was legal to operate as a prostitute basically through ads and Craigslist and such. You just can't, y'know, open a brothel or solicit on the street or such. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The whole anti-porn law thing always strikes me as weird. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A similar case is Japan where prostitution was legal since, well, just about forever IIRC, but was then made illegal post-war (and I wonder what prudish occupying country probably rammed  <em>that</em>  down their throats). Except, and this is the interesting bit, they were very specific and it only applied to vaginal penetration. Oral and anal sex are totally legal to sell in Japan. Showing genitals though? Hell no! That would be obscene! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess a big problem for me is also the concept of "obscenity". I just don't really get it. I guess I would need to massively overhaul my moral system in order to be able to any sort of word or image being capable of that sort of offense. Crass or poor taste, yes, but not so much obscenity.

      I've always held the simple principle that adults should be allowed access to whatever the hell they want to watch, period. If I want to watch a video of people cutting each other, shitting in the open wounds, and then sucking the blood/feces mixture out through a straw while swimming in gallons of jizz, and someone is willing to make said video with consenting adults, then it is no one else's business. No exceptions. I don't understand why this is such a difficult concept for people to grasp.

      Why is it that 'curvy' is so rarely seen as a euphemism for male adiposity? My mind somehow knows that 'chunky' or 'heavy set' are inherently more masculine descriptions, but I can't work out what is causing it to reach that conclusion.

      It more or less does. They both derive from the Attic Greek 'homos' meaning 'same'. 'Homosexuality' means being attracted to somone the same gender as yourself. I assume that the 'homeo' prefix in 'homeo-uroptic' comes from 'homeopathy', which is so called because it treats symptoms with very small doses of substances known to induce those symptoms. 'Pathos' is Greek for 'suffering' or 'disease'.

      The Greek for man is 'andros' ('anthropos' is also sometimes translated as 'man' but it is not gender specific). 'Homo' is 'man' in latin, but it is not the origin of the word homosexual, which is a term that can be applied with equal accuracy both to gay men and lesbians.

      This topic may have already been discussed in an assetbar thread; apologies if it has. The current Achewood business model seems based on having a loss leader cartoon which draws people to purchase items and subscriptions. Perfectly valid. However, I don't see why the website could not additionally support paid advertising. I know that some people don't like the idea of being bombarded with adverts, but I don't think anyone would really object to Onstad making a little extra dough. In a best case scenario Onstad might decide to end the subscription service and publish all new comics on the main site, to increase website hits and hence advertising revenue, resulting in happy comic writer as well as happy readers (in fairness subscriber archives should probably remain the preserve of those who have actually got their checkbook out, and can remain in existence as a treat for those generous enough to gave donated). It is possible that I have just woefully overestimated the amount of money that a website can make from advertising, or underestimated the number of people who subscribe. If people do object to tasteful advertising (i.e. no links to dogging websites) feel free to shout this idea down, though I'd be interested as to your reasons.

      I do not believe that the dogging trend has really caught on over here. A shame really. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For a comic where just recently the disgusting nature of tobacco-infused semen was addressed I do not think we need to worry too much about "tasteful" either. If anything I think it would be greatly enhanced by the right sort of advertising in that vein. An invitation to purchase the latest volume of Hot Tub Brawls, for instance, would doubtless be very well-placed.

      I don't really agree with the notion of the 'corporation' which seeks to homogenise the media it advertises in. Barring terrestrial television, most people choose which media they consume, and can be assumed to be tolerant of its content. By reading Achewood I show myself to be relaxed about depictions of the consumption of cannabis and pictures of rock hard cat cock. Therefore why would an advertiser try to restrict the creativity of the writer, when it was that very creativity that bought in the audience which the advertiser seeks to reach. The idea that money prevents restricts artistic expression would have been quite alien to Thomas Nashe or Shakespeare.
