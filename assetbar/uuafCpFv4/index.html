      Who said it was common? My last name is Scottish, which is because the slaveowners who owned my family in the 19th century were Scottish. I went to school with a black second-generation Caribbean whose last name was Chinese, which is because the descendants of Chinese immigrants actually make up a considerable portion of the population there (this was confirmed by my sister-in-law, who is from Guyana, who was explaining the cross-pollination, if you will, of Chinese and Caribbean cuisine). <br/>

Given all that, is it really such a stretch of the imagination that somewhere in Beef's lineage, a white Greek dude married a black woman?

      Not that there is any love lost.  The Draft Riots during the Civil War are one of the most shameful displays of racist rage (perpetrated by the Irish).  The Irish and Blacks being co-equal at the bottom of society should have been fighting the WASPs that oppressed both cultures.

      More like stop being such a  <em>lazy</em>  racist, sje. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You really think making hi-larious racialist humor is as easy as taking a simple N word and turning it into The N Word? <br/> 
 <br/>

A true master knows his tools.

      I just have a different idea of comfort from most people. I cannot understand wanting to remove your clothes and sit around in your pajamas or crawl under a blanket. It seems profoundly unpleasant and uncomfortable to me on what a number of levels. I also greatly dislike sweaters, most long sleeved shirts, and being "bundled up". <br/>

Turtlenecks are, of course, simply an abomination.

      What?! I love layers! I wear like seven layers in the winter! (oh and I think you can wear those ugly things over clothing). Man winters are hell of cold up here.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Allow me to give you a comprehensive list of what I wear in lets say -20 C  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nylons <br/> 
Tights <br/> 
A wife beater <br/> 
A t-shirt <br/> 
Knee-high socks <br/> 
Long sleeve shirt <br/> 
Jeans <br/> 
Sweater <br/> 
Another pair of socks <br/> 
Jacket <br/> 
Scarf, gloves, hat with flappidy ears, etc.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Keep in mind that I weigh about 100 lbs and do not have much body heat, so I gots to layer up) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, if you have to wear a snuggie, you might as well just go down to a homeless shelter and get a anrmy blanket and just wear it everywhere.

      This is one of the reasons why I hate cold weather. It is still unpleasantly cold here much of the time, but it's almost always in the manner that it is always tolerable as long as you have a coat. Still, I don't like having to wear a coat all summer.

      Snuggie is indeed the worst ever. Even moreso since the Snugglie was a baby-carrying device of the type that is commonly seen today on the chests of disinterested parents. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm told it was briefly a trend last year or so, but it horrifies me. There is even a Snuggie pub crawl happening with people wearing them out and custom Snuggie drinks and such. That is indeed a grand offense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was also informed that it's basically just a robe worn backwards.

      I agree though. It was a one-shot sort of thing. This shouldn't be a recurring character. It really doesn't add enough and it's already gotten stale. Really the only thing it can do is demand certain foods, threaten Beef if they are not provided or the wrong food is given to it, and occasionally comment on what it overhears about all of Beef's most private moments. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There just isn't enough there for a recurring character and even if there were, I wouldn't want it back.

      I'm quite surprised, frankly.  I trust you, however.  Is there a simple explanation for this?  Like something along the lines of Japan having urnaium radiation, which is less harmful than plutoniumn radiation, which Chernobyl had (I know Nagasake was Plutonium though . .. right?) or is it too long or complicated to get into it?

      The point I originally intended to make, which so eludes those ignorant of  <em>science</em> , is that they were two of a fundamentally different nature. The bang and flash of an atom bomb is a very different beast than the unleashing of a nuclear Prometheus from his chains (and the fissile matter is of little import). So, too, is the aftermath. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 The destruction unleashed by the Bombs was magnificent, but brief, and though it left us with many a fascinating tale and a terrible hangover, recovery was soon at hand. Chernobyl, however, was rendered a land of ghosts and broken souls, an over-grown wasteland unfit for the habitation of Man.

      Please read over what I said.  I'm not interested in which disaster is worse, but the explanation--if it's not too complicated--of why a weapon that is designed to kill as many people as possible only released 1/300th of the radiation that was released by a malfunction of a site that was designed (however poorly) to  <em>not</em>  release radiation. <br/>

No one is making Holocaust jokes here, and no one is saying or implying either event wasn't terrible.  All we are talking about is which area is worse off.  Like saying that WWII was worse than the Vietnam War because more suffering was involved.  IS that really such a horrific statement?  It's a true statement.  A true statement that doesn't trivialize a thing at all. <br/> 
And doesn't desensitize anyone anyway.   <br/> 
Yes, I guess if we talked about the issue in a certain way, it would trivialize, etc.  But all I was talking about was radiation released. <br/>

      Were in Chernobyl? How about  <em>Are</em> ? As in <br/> 
It's still sitting in there, ticking away.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
A ton of plutonium, and hundreds, if not thousands of tons of uranium;(semicolon) not the Mickey-Mouse quantities used on Nagasaki.  <br/> 
 The hope is that the unstable plutonium does not somehow decay/burn its surroundings to where enough of it somehow clumps together physically to unleash true hell on earth. Odds of that are  <em>probably</em>  remote. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But then, the engineers who designed and operated the original plant were true morons, and the odds of a meltdown were pretty remote until they deliberately initiated one, so in ex-Stalinist ex-Soviet Union, never say never. <br/>

      You're right, and the reactors at Chernobyl used bricks of graphite as damping material, so when they caught fire, all the nuclear stuff went up in smoke.  It warn't no explosion, it were an old-fashioned fire.

      It's a technocratic language game that never actually discusses the human impact of the tragedies. I'm saying that without humanizing the victims and talking about what happened in specific terms instead of abstract, scientific ones, you de-emphasize the moral horror we should by rights feel when thinking or talking about the disaster. We are being numbed to catastrophe. If you go back and read the discussion, there are numerous examples of this kind of callous rhetoric. <br/>

      WEll, I was finally convinced that rape jokes and racist jokes and so on are bad, because of trivialization, but I fail to see how anyone is trivializing it though.  I don't see why it's always necessary to include the human element.  I don't know. <br/>

It reminds me of the time that the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, in 1945.  What a horrible tragedy.  There was a bright flash of light, blinding those innocent souls, and instead of a roaring sound there was a deafening silence.  It was as if time stood still.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
The few that survived had to sacrifice greatly to make sure that others live.  Many people's skin was melted off, and shards of glass were imbedded in, glistening; there is no smell no wretched than the smell of burning human hair and skin.  They walked like zombies, with their arms(well, the ones that still had arms) out in front of them.  They couldn't see because the eyes had melted out of their sockets.  They were like zombies, and not one of them was going to live more than a few hours. <br/>

The young boy gave them the uncontaminated water, and as soon as he did, each one collapse.  It turns out that they were holding out for the water, for the final satisfaction that is hydration, before they could die in peace. <br/>

      And maybe the reason why your long narrative seems so disingenuous is because it's incompatible with the discussion you're tryin to have. Like, when you imply "can we go back to comparing the two now," it seems like there's no good way to incorporate a narrative about the scale of the human consequences because you shouldn't be talking about it in the first place. But maybe, you shouldn't be trying to compare two catastrophes in the first place, unless you have a very important reason (ie not just idle speculation). Like, you need to make a decision about advocating aid dollars - something that makes the comparison instrumentally valuable.

      Re-reading my earlier comments, I need to clarify something. You're not awful people if I'm right. That was a silly, hyperbolic thing to say. I'm just trying to make the argument that it's insensitive and frivolous, and that you should reconsider even having this discussion. Saying "you're awful for saying X" is just antagonistic and makes it seem like I'm comparing it to active prejudice or something. I'm really just trying to say that you're not using harmless, neutral language, and that you should rethink some of your preconceptions.

      My long narrative seems disingenuous because I wrote it to mock you, and because I was not interested in thinking the victims at that point of time, but you seem to require that I think about them, when all I wanted to talk about is why a nuclear accident which is designed to be safe released more radiation than a bomb which is designed to kill as many people as possible.  A scientific, non-emotional question.  It's like I'm asking "How many children are raped in Canada a year exactly?  How many in Great Britain?" because I'm interested in this, to see if the rates are different, so I can form hypotheses in my head over why this could be, and you're going "YOU ARE ENABLING A RAPE CULTURE".  I'm not; you're completely misreading my intentions and the way the words are coming out of my mouth (hands).  If I was going "Dude, like eight people were raped in my town of five-thousand.  We're, like, the rape capital of the world!", I can understand why this could be offensive and trivializes the matter.  Also, I am not as eager as you may think I am to discuss which tragedy is worse. <br/> 
I like to learn things, and what I was trying to learn (even though I don't really care right now) is why Chernobyl was worse than Hiroshima and Nagasaki in scientific terms.  When you suggest that only people who can do something about a topic should talk about it, I am reminded of totalitarianism.  IF I want to form a theory about the best way to spend AIDS dollars, there is nothing wrong with my asking questions about it, even though I have no say in the matter.  There is nothing wrong with discussing emotional issues even if you don't need to; it is not  <em>a priori</em>  wrong.  And in this case, what we were doing was not  <em>a posteriori</em>  wrong. [apologies if I'm using these terms wrong].

      Look, dude. Frankly, I don't think the conversation you're trying to have would be successful anywhere else. If you got a group of professional scientists together in a room and they were trying to figure out how Chernobyl happened, it wouldn't be surprising if they discussed the gravity of the situation by putting it into Hiroshima terms. And if they had to stop every five minutes to add the human element to their conversation, they'd never get anything done. Save that for the article in  <em>Scientific American</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Complaining about any perceived insensitivity of scientific language is pointless. It's not going to help the people that were effected that other people are talking about it "right." It's not like some racist who hates Japanese is going to listen in and think "Hey a bunch of smart-sounding people are talking about the atomic bombings as if the victims aren't human! I guess it's okay to kill Japanese people now!" <br/>

      Some of the most interesting conversations I've had were over the Internet, all of which did not result in going around in circles and ad hominem.

      No, I don't like the internet as a medium because of communication problems, notably: <br/> 
-asynchronous communication (the question/response or argument/response or comment/comment interaction isn't immediate and direct) <br/> 
-typing as a means of communication is less effective for how I express ideas, except when I have a lot of time to refine what I want to say, probably due to the informality, ability to continue explaining if I don't think I've expressed myself well, body language, and inflection <br/> 
-Physical presence (or at least voice cues) make it much easier for me to gauge your response to an argument, which makes interpreting the dialogue easier <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nobody said anything about "you guys are all stupid." I said you were horrible people, but I also recanted that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As to the original topic: I guess, ultimately, I'm too goddamn lazy to go round up the relevant nukespeak/technocracy sources when no one is receptive to the argument at all and everyone just thinks I'm a giant douche for presuming to criticize you.

      I dont know the documentary on the children on chernobyl made me cry, but the doc on the rape of nanking made me think "how the hell can people do these things and why things like this happen all through history?"  <br/>

I mean, take the spanish inquisition! what kind of a person does one have to be to not only stand by while people are tortured and killed in the worst way, but to actually cheer and be happy they are dead!?  <br/>

I dont think killing is always wrong. Self defence and certain situations are exception, but torture and  <em>amusement from it</em>  are so wrong, always. <br/>

      No way. Sweden doesn't seem too big on fetishes. I think Germany is up there though, probably #3, the Netherlands in at #4, and then England at #5. English types be hella repressed yo. Plus they have a storied history of being very into spanking fetishism in the Victorian era while Americans were more known for their rubber fetishes. To the degree that these were known, respectively, as the English and American vice.

      I was not aware that they were nymphomaniacs, but I was aware that they produce some of the finest dildos that are not made in Japan.

      I doubt she does.  I know she has bought clothes there, but not in a while, probably before you started working there.  She donates to it a lot. <br/> 
She lives in MA, so I doubt she's in Londonderry too much anymore.  HER name is Sue, though, and she's very tan.

Also fuck YES to this strip.  I want to rate it a "fuck YES."  "My boys down in renal" made me say "fuck YES" so that is why I want to give it a "fuck YES."  I like Nick the Stomach as a kind of sideline character.  Let's just hope there aren't major stories out of this because let's face it, a talking stomach would remind half of Assetbar of the Polly/Connie shackin' up episode and many didn't like that. <br/>

Actually, a story where Beef has to search for a specific kind of food across the country in a kind of "On The Road" meets "Fear and Loathing" type deal would be sick..

      Yeah, we haven't really seen Cornelius since that arc have we? That could be a reason why Onstad's updating is so sporadic lately. I think he would like to be able to deal with Penny's character in a fitting way without totally making her introduction seem like it was in vain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I, for one, hope Onstad doesn't delete Penny from the storyline. A lot of people seem to think she was irritating for some reason. I think the problem was that the first time we were meeting her outside of the context of her talking with Connie was the dinner meeting with Ray, and she just seemed to bring out all the snarkiness in Connie. In a way that seems true because here is this cultured guy Cornelius always hanging out with these Rude Dudes and does he ever feel like he has to vent his frustrations with the way they are? <br/> 
 <br/> 
It just shows how much the  <em>Achewood</em>  cast feels like dudes you hang out with. And if one of them has a new girlfriend everyone else seizes on her with eyes of jealousy and envy, both for the time she is taking away from the dude hanging out with the other dudes and the fact that the dude who gets to bone her and show her off is not you. I don't think Penny would piss off  <em>every</em>  other character in Acheworld. I think she just sees through Ray's occasional pretension. She might enjoy the company of the recently married and sometimes less tense Roast Beef, the skilled cook Teodor, discussing Blackberry Apps with Molly (I do not know that they would do this, I just did not want the one thing the two girls in the comic to talk about to wind up being the deals they got at Bed Bath and Beyond, and I figured a little bit of the consumer tech angle would have rubbed off Beef onto Molly by now), hell she might even be cool with Lyle because Lyle does not pretend for anyone. I don't know, I just would like there to be female characters besides Molly and Tina and I don't think Penny and Cornelius's relationship should just disappear into the wailing winds of retcon or be explained away with "Oh it was a May-December relationship that was doomed to not last because we have nothing in common." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry if this is a rant.

I don't know how he would do that, he's the creator, not me obviously, but she just seemed to be a sounding board for him.  Character-wise, yes, bully for Connie for finding a girl at his age etc. but she just didn't seem that exciting.  I welcomed the change and the story in general but she wasn't as dynamic as I had hoped.  I think Onstad can do great things with that if he ever revisits it.  I just don't want it to be Connie talking to Connie.

      This. Polly brought out the worst in Onstad's character writing; Connie in the later strips of that arc read almost like a parody of Cornelius Bear. ("Capital! Let us upturn a chair and leave the telltale tortoiseshell comb.") <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not convinced that Onstad knows where he's going with this arc (well, it's Onstad, so he probably doesn't -- he's said as much) but I'd rather give it the benefit of the doubt for a couple more strips.

      What I'm trying to say is that the writing in these strips isn't so bad that it's better to abandon it, and if you think that it's locked into the one conceptual idea, I have three words for you: "Ana-Tomix Car Concepts."

      This is very true.  We all know his penchant for stream-of-consciousness story building.  But I mean as it was, it didnt't go anywhere.  I enjoyed their meeting, but the dinner with Ray went nowhere.  A little but of surreality would help I think, but I have no idea how it could be done without reading like a parody of Achewood.  Onstad can pull it off, hopefully; I'd hate to see a character get Chuck Cunninghamed by a great writer.

      <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>This. Polly brought out the worst in Onstad's character writing; Connie in the later strips of that arc read almost like a parody of Cornelius Bear.</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
It only seems that way because that arc gave Cornelius a big batch of dialogue all at once.  The truth is that everything Connie has said for the past few years sounds like a parody of Cornelius Bear.  His  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413121649/https://corneliusbear.blogspot.com/">blog</a>  contains some good examples of vocabulary's triumph over substance.  I argue that the only problem with the Polly arc was that it took Cornelius's verbal style out of the realm of the one-liner (where he excelled as the literate foil to other characters' crudeness) and into a long form where his cleverness overstayed its welcome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The other problem with the Polly arc, I suppose, is that Polly matched Cornelius's style too well.  That made for some  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100413121649/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua2L4BZh">transcendant moments</a>  but didn't allow for any tension or conflict in the relationship.  Conversely, the Roast Beef/Molly dynamic has flourished because they represent different forces--sometimes complementary, sometimes conflicting, but seldom serving as mirror images of each other the way Cornelius and Polly do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Void America's opinion on the interpersonal dynamic between two cartoon bears is: more studied than the subject merits.  Just read the cartoon and have fun.</em>

But that Dawn was a terrible addition to a show that reached its peak in season 3 and then steadily went downhill from season 4 on (not that there was not much to enjoy then, but it was still a case of each season being worse and worse... even as the writing and characterization was generally excellent) meaning that for the majority of its run its best days were behind it.

      You're right, I forgot you liked Polly and not the stomach.  See, I liked the last stomach one, not so much the first, but only for the words: I don't really see a great arc coming from it unless Beef Pirsigs across the country for some food.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Always Visit The Right Man" was good but the first few panels were stilted to me and just add to the argument that a two-tier comic thrice or four times a week > twice or thrice updated 5 tier comics.   <br/> 
" <br/> 
The Sideburn Generator" was just a goof-off that I really liked, if only for "A SMILE FOR  <em><span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">ROBERT!</span></em> " and the strongly suggested leather cop hat.  I've stated my passion for one-off comics before, and I'm hoping Onstad would just trim most comics to a two or three tier and make them one-off goof-offs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My last favorite one would have to be "Phrase Out Of Water," and that was apparently old from the subscriber section.  Before that, "Because I Got Depression" might be the last really really good one and that's pre-Christmas.  But I do like these last few, certainly more than Ray's dinner party, and I'm banking on Onstad returning to form soon enough.

      I think if more emphasis were put on this side of Polly's personality, she might have turned out to be more popular.  The problem was that after her initial introduction, the first scene we got with her mainly consisted of her and Cornelius making fun of Ray for being Ray.  Since most Achewood readers like Ray, we're not inclined to like a character who not only makes fun of him, but also gets Cornelius, a character who we also generally like, to join in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, she seemed like she had the potential to have a fun personality, but then one of the first things we saw he do seemed to pretty much bring out the worst of it.  If we saw more of the fun adventurous ex-stripper side of her, and less of the snooty side that maliciously makes fun of Ray's mannerisms, maybe we'd have enjoyed her more. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Although the fact remains that she wasn't particularly funny either.  Not that every character in Achewood has to be inherently funny, but most of the characters have fairly hilarious mannerisms in general.  You can have a comic that's just Ray being Ray or Beef being Beef or Todd being Todd or Phillipe being Phillipe, and it can be funny just because their personalities are so entertaining.  Polly's background gave her potential, but she never really did anything funny.

      although she could have been making fun of ray in a good-natured way, as if to say to connie, "i realize your friend has set the dial to maximum awkward, but it's ok because i know that it is because he is a dude of exaggerated gregariousness and so i will overlook it and pretend to laugh at his jokes."

      ...which it seemed like she never did, if I didn't misread that arc. <br/>

Also, a plot with Connie dealing with that stripper-dom ie. ornery ex-boyfriend who is of the fighting spirit, threatening manager who lost a good worker, etc? Maybe?  Too plot-driven?  Too cheesy?

      I think maybe not ridiculous enough.  I mean, it would have the potential to be ridiculous and hilarious, but it also would have the potential to be like the rest of the Polly arc, where stuff happens that makes sense but isn't especially funny or entertaining. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't really have a huge problem with Polly, but the Ray dinner wasn't an especially great introduction for her and she didn't seem like she had the potential to be anywhere near as great as many of Achewood's other characters, even if there still was potential for entertainment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd be okay if she just played a similar role for Cornelius that Molly does for Beef.  The problem is that while Molly often brings out the best in Beef, Polly seemed to bring out the worst in Cornelius from what we saw of her.

      I fall squarely in the "shape up or ship out" camp in regards to Polly. I don't like the idea of having another female character just for the sake of having one. Molly is a very good, well-rounded character and Tina at least serves a clear-cut villain role. Polly is just....there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What it boils down to is that Beef's stomach had more funny lines in two panels than Polly has even yet mustered, therefore I hope this arc continues and I can't say I'd be bothered if Polly faded into the background.

      In all fairness it's pretty easy to forget what has happened already on the show. It's certainly happened to the writers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At this point we're lucky to even have a smattering of the original cast around and even the majority of them are stuck off in... well, in who knows where. This time-shifting stuff is just really screwing it all up. Like they decided to make this the new flashback/flashforward. The way that gave out so quickly certainly implies that they never planned things out. Not to mention how many times they apparently wrote in new characters because they liked someone's audition or how they wanted to kill off a character, but hadn't decided who yet. Doesn't speak to it having a solid arc or the early elements where all of these people are somehow related. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But yeah, you really need to be up to date. That is, assuming you weren't late to the party and are watching them on DVDs thus forcing you to always be a season behind and unable to watch the current season most of the time. I'm no up on the DVD schedule as I can't possibly imagine wanting to own or re-watch Lost.

      Meh, I started watching with the first episode because it sounded like the only interesting thing that season. I've been with it all along and while it certainly came out there it's really just the case that the show has deep problems, but I keep watching it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was hoping that Brian K. Vaughn would help fix it up, but no. I can't even remotely detect his influence on the show aside from that tiny bit of placement for  <em>Y: The Last Man</em>  the other day.

I Tivo everything so, no, I haven't yet watched the most recent episode. I'll probably get around to it eventually. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I love Brian K. Vaughn's comics work, but I just haven't seen any influence of his style into Lost yet. Oh, and if you haven't noticed just about every member of the writing staff is given a producer credit on many shows. Especially the Simpsons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If having negative things to say about Lost is something you have never heard before I cannot imagine that you have ever talked to anyone about the show or heard anything referring to it for many years.

      Those people are idiots then. Last season was starting to get better, but this season is a lot worse. The part where they keep introducing new characters almost every damn season and then killing off a bunch of them really is starting to bother me. It's barely even about the main cast at this point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For the past few episodes this season it's been basically nothing but new cast members running around on the island and everyone else floundering around in LA in the future. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The story has also lost coherence. I don't think they have a goal in mind at this point. I mean, maybe Ben does, but that's it.

      Gladi8orrex for February 21, 2009, as translated by Cpnglxynchos. Three (3) comments by Glad and one by Mattylite gladi8'd: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Part One, The Statement: <br/> 
i was talkin to my friend one time and i was on about crims* (as usual) and i said to him 'the world is so full of crime, dawg. everyone straight breaking the law.' and he says, 'true, true, but what i was forgetting (he says) was that overall, crims* are the minority.' and i said back to him, 'you have that backwards.' <br/> 
 <br/> 
we both lol'd at the joke oasis and continued to debate about crims. it was concluded that basically everyone is a crim 'cos of traffic violations.  <em>*shrug*</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
*criminals. <br/> 
Part Two, A Rebuttal: <br/>

      I love Italian food, but I have never had a cannoli. This is because wherever there are cannolis of any quality, there are tiramisus as well.

      While the chubby is indeed appreciated EXTREME AGREEMENT is typically best expressed by a resounding high-five while a nuclear explosion goes off in the background (remaining entirely dismissive of the very real and painful human cost and the tremendous suffering entailed to express your similarity of opinion) before a searing guitar solo kicks in. <br/>

      I feel I should point out that seikel is making a reference to the Patti Smith song "Rock N' Roll Nigger." The song has its critics because of Smith's apparent attempt to take a very specific racial slur and expand it's meaning so that it refers to all people who are oppressed, or "outside of society" as the chorus repeats, and unite them under the banner of rock n' roll. Another interpretation of the song is that it's hard to be a rock musician if you're a woman. You're treated as a second class citizen by your peers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The theme was revisited by John Lennon with his song "Woman Is The Nigger Of The World." <br/>

      Not entirely true, but yeah, I find it amazing how often I will things that are not good. I suspect other people just have really low standards or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, I am filled with a vast well of deep, serious, obsessive love for many, many things, but perhaps there is so much out there that I also run into a lot of the bad stuff too. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's all Sturgeon's Law: 90% of everything is crap. Of course, I'm also willing to take this the extra step that so many others lack and apply it to people. Assetbar is one of the few oases where the ratio is actually inverted.

      I've got nothing specifically against fringe (or, to use the coarse American term, bangs), but I do have something against the increased prevalence of it these days among unattractive hipster girls. <br/>

My greater issue is that she is merely not particularly attractive. I see people walking around every day of my life that are decidedly more attractive and deserving of my digital lust. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not even hate, I just... I can't see what you all are getting so worked up about. I guess it's like discovering your sexual preference. All looking at a vagina or cock and being "Man, what is the fuss all about? I just don't have any interest in that at all." <br/>

      I still do. It's not the jump to the next generation either. It's taking great games and putting them in 3d for no goddamn reason just because it was trendy and new and a great way to use technology that could barely manage to do it and made everything look really bad. Most of those early 3d games have really not held up very well you'll notice. The graphics look clunky and dated a lot worse than even early 80s arcade games or other heavily pixelated graphics. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I thought we were addressing this with how Metroid Prime was inferior. I've really got nothing specifically against Megaman on the Gameboy, but it wasn't particularly great. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, it's not always the case that a game is made worse. Prince of Persia: Sands of Time came out great for a modernization of the classic game. I just think a lot of people, primarily Nintendo, decided that everything now had to be 3d and abandoned 2d gaming. This was often a poor decision. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ocarina of Time is still vastly inferior to Link to the Past, which is still the best Zelda game ever made.

      Not true, have you played the new generation 2d Zelda games? They aren't nearly as much fun as anything else in the series. <br/>

Nintendo has all but abandoned Mario's platforming roots, but it is almost for the better. The Mario RPG's are leaps and bounds better.

      The Mario RPGs are great, but the 3D Mario games (haven't played Galaxy yet) are generally mediocre at best and have nothing in common with the originals. <br/> 
 <br/> 
New Super Mario Bros. was a great return to form though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I haven't played the... new generation 2D Zelda? You mean The Minish Cap? That's the only one I know of and it wasn't made by Nintendo internally. I keep meaning to get that, but no, not yet.

      Well that, the two Game Boy Color games (also from Capcom), and Phantom Hourglass. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Minish was good, the story tied together the Four Swords saga and the actual timeline very well. I've only played a little of the Game Boy Color ones so I can't judge, but Phantom Hourglass is boring as hell. I mean, a mediocre Zelda is better than the best of a lot of games, but it is just not that fun, which is a shame because it could have done a lot with the ending of Wind Waker and basically spoiled it with a "it was all just a dream...OR WAS IT?!" ending, which it ripped off from the much better Link's Awakening.

      I never owned a Game Boy Color so, uh, I missed that whole era. I was barely even aware that they started making games intended for it. I thought it was just doing crappy fake-color for pre-existing games for a long time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I thought Phantom Hourglass was technically more 3D and in the Wind Waker tradition. It's kinda on my list, but not a very pressing need. I hate that idea that I have to move entirely with the stylus and just tap to fight. Not my bag at all.

      These are all fair arguments, but none of them explain how you could possibly consider Ocarina of Time to be a less-than-stellar game. I might agree that it's not as good as Link to the Past (If I'd played that) but as a game it didn't suffer at all from the transition to full 3D. It had a great engine, pretty damn innovative and enjoyable combat for it's time, varied and entertaining dungeons and... well, I've never found the visuals to be lacking at all. I'm surprised that Majora's Mask brought enough to the table to qualify as an improvement.

      I disagree with you. I thought it significantly less-than-stellar and found it to suffer greatly in the transition. <br/>

This is all a matter of opinion though and there is nothing to be had in arguing about it any longer. We disagree on this matter and there is no way to reconcile it that I can see.

      These Beatles they make, eh, some good pop songs, yes? But are so great? I say not so much. The Who? Much better band. Better songs, all musicians acclaimed as beink some of best in their field. Beatles are not bad, I am not going to be sayink that at all, but are overpraised. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For me is findink TMBG to be more enjoyable band to listen to. Care much more for them. You have right to opinion though and I not think less of you for holdink it. As I say, they write some good song, just not best thing ever being.

      I just realized yesterday how awesome "Why Don't We Do It In The Road" is.   <br/> 
Also, Phish played the entire White Album in concert once, and that was only half the songs they did.  And I actually quite enjoy it. <br/>

      Fraternal or identical? My girlfriend has a fraternal (or as I typically say, sororal) twin sister. I maintain that she is the younger because she was technically conceived a month later (note to peoples: just because you're pregnant doesn't mean you can't get double pregnant sometimes), but was born first, albeit slightly premature, when her sister was born. <br/>

      I have both fraternal and identical twin cousins.  On the same side of the family (my mother's). <br/>

Apparently the national average is about 1 in 33, so 2 of 6 pregnancies (all my maternal aunt/uncles' kids plus me) is a pretty unlikely event. <br/>

      Not entirely. Apparently opposite sex fraternal twins are more common as well. That doesn't make any sort of sense to me and I specialize in genetics. Maybe if I diagram it, but I'm far too lazy. Still, odds should remain at 50% for both genders.

      Now, while on an instinctual, base level I fully understand that and can get behind it on an intellectual level I think that identical twins would be less interesting that two super hot, but non-identical people.

Maybe it is more of an issue of comparison. Like trying two different cheeses from the same region, but different producers and appreciating the subtle differences. <br/>

      That just means that birth control is a good idea. I think that is a typical opinion of all people. I presumed that not having children was a given. <br/>

I see where you're coming from, but in my mind a taboo is only given power if you let it affect your behavior. I mean, yes, it will still exist in the minds of some people, but if you don't go along with it you will still be free.
