      Wow. This is a pretty awesome object lesson in how things are offensive not due to what is said, but who is  saying it. It's also telling of a mild ethnocentrism, since pretty much all of us assumed that zefiel was white. Man, I could write a whole cultural studies thesis on this.

      there is a difference no matter what. when my dad (acentral american immigrant) says "mexicans will marry your daughter!" it pisses off white ppl and is pretty funny, when Rush Limbaugh says it, it makes white ppl mad and is racist, and the root of hate crimes.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't say zifel was a racist, just that where I live. I've ONLY heard strait up iron cross wearing bikers that hate the idea of happiness say this. for real.  <br/>

but yeah. pls post your thesis when your done. I will also read it. lol please include a P about how "white" is a race and "mexican" isn't

      Man, anyone can have a baby. That's the easiest thing to do. This is like repeatedly bringing up that you know what a bird is. Who doesn't know what a bird is? It's so easy to know about birds and to have a child, and I maintain that explicit genitalia isn't strictly necessary for either one.

      I have a story :(  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was getting down to some bidness, by which I mean being intimate. It was getting pretty steamy and everything, when suddenly, for no reason, JAIME THE SCIENCE FRIEND just popped into my head. Specifically him saying "I got no time for a ugly penny ! I was like, this is craaazy !" <br/> 
Understandably, I immediately started laughing uncontrollably, which spoiled the mood a little. I tried to put it from my mind but all that happened was that I thought " <em>Maybe ju an' me are amigos !</em> " <br/> 
 <br/> 
It took me some time to recover. Screw you, Jaime the Science Friend! <br/> 
It's still a 5 though.
