      He-Man was having trouble figuring out what ratio of land cards to use, all having just ten land cards in a sixty-card deck. <br/>

      Now I know why I used to lose all the time at that game. I wasn't figurin' out no curves or whatnot. I was calculating that the picture of the vampire dude on this "Leshrac" card was fucking badass and how on earth could I lose? Also this card has a hilarious goblin on it I am SO throwing it into my deck.

      If "Vintage" means "Moxes are restricted," then it's no wonder.  I don't really play any format, I just pay attention to stuff that Mike Flores says sometimes.

      Is draft 40? I might have forgotten that. It's not a format I play often. Moxes and lotuses are part of the reason the mana curve is so low in vintage, but it's also that it allows a selection of the cheapest and fastest ways to kick ass printed in the game.

      Yeah, it's that, too.  I like playing with the new tech they come out with, even though the old stuff is always going to be the best. <br/>

Attention Assetbar, I would like to point this out to you:  If you own a bunch of old cards and you have not played Magic in years,  <em>sell those cards.</em>   You will make rent.

      At sound of my door slamming and my Jessica Alba Invisible Woman poster falling to the floor, I looked up from my PSP. Preparing an angry volley of cusses for my intruder, I was stunned silent from the sight of He-Man standing in my room clad in sword, loincloth, and little else. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Timmy," he said in that mighty tenor that evoked both strength and purity. "You must help me. Skeletor challenged me to a game of Magic: The Gathering for the sake of Eternia and I, in moment of vaingloriousness, accepted the challenge. Timmy, mine is the art of the sword and the sorcery of Castle Greyskull. I know nothing of this Gathering Magic! Not even that floating wizard with the hat and the zero on his chest could help, forgive me as I have forgotten his name." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"But you, Timmy. Everyone knows that you are the Magic: the Gathering master! You must help me build a deck that will defeat Skeletor!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I paused my game and set the PSP aside. So the story of my victory at the Pawtucket Mall 5th Edition Draft Tournament had reached even the hallowed halls of Eternia.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"I will help you, He-Man. Though the training will be difficult and my explanations of Interrupt spells hazy. You must prevail! I will teach you." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Face radiant with joy, He-Man grasped my hand in thanks. "Thank you," he said. "Just let me put my cape on, as it is quite chilly in here." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"No," I said eyes transfixed by He-Man's erect nipples. "I think training would be best if you stayed... as you are." <br/> 
 <br/> 
With his blonde page-boy haircut fluttering in the AC breeze, He-Man winked at me.

      I once was having drinks with a group of people which included one person who worked with Sony's interactive entertainment group. I found this out when I made a rant to the effect of "Sony, when will you learn? We don't want your MiniDiscs (as useful as they may be in a studio environment), we don't want your Memory Sticks, and we certainly don't want your UMDs! Stop trying to invent new kinds of digital media and just use what everyone else does!" <br/>

I felt a little awkward about it but much less so when I realized that before the drinks arrived, she was playing with her Nintendo DS.

      Months and months ago, when I read this strip, I pondered the bizarre artifact in the second frame.  The above post made me wonder:  "Is that... a nipple?  It looks vaguely like a nipple.  Why is there a wall with a nipple on it?"  Only now did I catch the tiny unobscured fraction of the upper boundary of the photo, the subtly absent conclusion of the tilted vertical line.  A rarely seen close-up of Teodore's  paw.  Still disturbing.

      because panel 3 is not a picture. It just shows us what the real portrait looks like. The picture is in 4, of Teodor holding the portrait... which, when you think about it, is a strange picture to take. "Here, you hold my senior portrait, and I'll take your picture."

      I don't know if it's a big thing, but, yeah, you see it.  There's a guy I see around my town at different bars who looks almost exactly like Beef in the last panel, just not really chubby and with a goatee.  He often has a laptop with him, at bars, on Saturday nights.  His wife/girlfiend sometimes is with him and I don't think I've ever seen her open her mouth to talk (she looks very frail and intimidated).  He was the first thing that came to mind when I read that strip where Ray gets a fedora, and Teodor does the whole Honda Goldwing/Collects swords bit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The other week, while watching him for amusement from my table, I noticed he ordered two beers for himself, a Guinness (draft) and a Harp (bottle), with a second empty glass.  I witnessed him pour the Harp into the second glass, then (very sloppily) try to pour some of the Guinness out of his glass into the Harp glass, getting a lot of it all over the table and rug.  I then noticed that he never drank from this glass, and it sat there for the next hour, untouched. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After pointing all this out to my friend, she said "I wonder what that's about?"  I replied, "I dunno, but I betch you it's like some tribute to his dead father or something...probably the same reason that jackass always wears a fedora." <br/> 
 <br/> 
My friend asked his waiter before we left, and, yep, I was pretty much dead on in my assumption (the bartenders/waitstaff think this guy is a fucking idiot, also). <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is the kind of thing these guys do: they're huge nerds, but they try so hard, yet so awkwardly, to pretend that they're not, and in doing so indulge in so many odd habits and mannerisms that they've confused to be stylish or cool; it only highlights their social deficincies all the more.  He probably sees his version of "pour one out for your homies" as some masculine tribute to his dead father, while his dad is saying somewhere "I'd rather you just learn to throw a baseball more than 15 feet and drink the god damn beer."
