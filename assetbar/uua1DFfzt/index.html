      The fact that fish very possibly feel something analogous to "pain" does not surprise me, nor do I give a shit at  <em>all.</em>   I have long held the belief humourously espoused in this strip - if you are wanting to eat an animal, you gotta be willing to kill it and, in Western society at least, accept that it has died in an extremely horrendous and painful fashion.  Sorta like something out of a Clive Barker film.  That's how they die, and I have come to accept it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would kill the cow with my own teeth, I'm comfortable with this.

      The gf and I were out walking yesterday and saw some deer across a field. As we passed some bushes she told me not to pee in my pants if a deer jumped out. I claimed that if one did, I was going to move in close to avoid swinging hooves, choke it with my bare hands, it would have to go in the back of her Hyundai, and it would have to be field dressed in her backyard since I live in an apartment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That quieted her down, and I think it's because she was wondering how long I'd been thinking about killing a deer with my bare hands.

      The Anthony Bourdain story about seeing the pig slaughtered was pretty impressive on this point. One image that I can't get out of my head is him watching as a farmer walked up to the still-bleeding carcas, pulls up its tail, puts his arm in the pig's ass up to the elbow, and begins flinging shit out of the anus. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I never thought about where that stuff goes when you cook food. I, like Ray, perhaps, have always assumed that a glock is sort of like a magic wand that turns pigs into brisket and geese into fois gras.

      Hell, it is impressive.  What I got from Bourdain on the subject was, 'Wow, that's great.  Give me steak-frites or a bowl of pho.'  Its a neat parlor trick, something new to experience, an important part of the culinary experience, but its not what moves him.  He's a bistro, working-man's fair kinda guy, and that's pretty much how I feel about it.

      THE LONE GUNMEN. They had a spin-off series that lasted something like twelve episodes and I remember one of them broadcast in early 2001 centered around a government plot to destroy the twin towers using commercial airliners. Not even kidding. Actually, I bet they have it up on YouTube...

 <br/> 
In a foreshadowing of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the plot of the March 4, 2001 pilot episode of the series depicts a secret U.S. government agency plotting to crash a Boeing 727 headed for Boston into the World Trade Center via remote control for the purpose of increasing the military defense budget and blaming the attack on foreign "tin-pot dictators" who are "begging to be smart-bombed." This episode was broadcast in Australia on August 30, less than two weeks before the 9/11 attacks.[3]

      Heh. "Japanese Nihongo". Nihongo meaning the Japanese language. Ray does not so much turn a phrase as spin the steering wheel so hard that the phrase knocks over a fire hydrant and smashes into a thick concrete wall, the resulting fire all almost immediately extinguished by the gout of water from where the fire hydrant once stood, Ray all leaning into the airbad, comfortable but confused, all silently thinking "The HEll, man? The HELL just happened?"

      When I was a kid, my parents would send my siblings and I off to my uncle's farm when they got to fighting too much. Once when I was eight we spent a few days there, and Uncle Hobert (that really was his name) called me out to "He'p fix up some supper." I, in my innocence, went to help him. I was greeted by the sight of my uncle holding up a squawking, flailing hen by her feet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That was the day I learned the fine art of chicken hypnosis, as well as the truth behind the phrase "running around like a chicken with it's head cut off." Thus began my downward spiral into vegetarianism.

      The cow is immobile. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray is all kinds of grunts and gasps as he carries the stool over, sets it up right next to the bovine bro and climbs it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once up he looks around, surveying and appreciating the view, and pretends to the see the cow by accident. Ray gives him a neutral kind of nod, as if to say "Oh, hey cow, didn't see you there, 'sup?" then looks solidly in the other direction. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Moments pass by slowly as the inevitable approaches...
