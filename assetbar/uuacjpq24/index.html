      Pretty wound up about what's going on here.  Again, EROTIC LITERATURE CONTEST.  Are we coming to the end?  Is this it?  An existential, Bob Newheart-y, "it-was-all-a-dream" climax?  Or, like, fucking Hamlet style character slaughter?  Long story short, are we for realsies right now?

      I think from a purely rational, financial, a bit cynical standpoint, this isn't the end because Achewood is right now entering some sort of public consciousness (the GOF book only came out about a year ago, and the second volume from Dark Horse is coming out soon).  It'd be bad press to end the comic just as things were building up on that end.  I don't know.  I'm not that kind of cynical dude, but that's my rationalization of my own denial at least, and I'm sticking to it.

      or maybe he's pulling out now precisely because of those reasons. CH is a man with very marketable skills, and his minor fame would make it easy to make the transition to something else. from what i can tell, achewood really blew up for him unexpectedly and out of nowhere, and hes been riding this wave for awhile, and maybe he's had his fill. i cant say i'd blame him honestly.  <br/> 
i have to say, if this were the last comic, i would be pretty satisfied. <br/>

but also people have paid for subscriber content for a year and shit like that. it would be pretty dubious to pull the plug with no obvious warning. dubious, but sweet.

      I wouldn't say that he has the option of oblivion per se, it doesn't really seem to be a part of this (ignoring the part where it all seems so cleverly engineered to lead precisely to this point). I do, however, think you have a really solid thing going with the Bodhisattva (Beef isn't much a fan of Bodhisattiva, especially after  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415014002/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=06272003">what happened the last time</a> ). Still, I'm not certain that he delayed his own ascension to Nirvana in order to help others with achieving enlightenment. The general case holds though. Of course, this also seems to ignore him being the instrument of his own rebirth and fixing his own skipping wheel. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I have hella issues with the whole deal of Bodhisattvas and any other of the bits that take Buddhism into seriously deistic areas. I mean, yeah, if you look at the origins there's a lot of mysticism and cross-over from Hinduism, but it still seems pretty possible to get to a place where it's more philosophy and personal than a full-on deistic religion where you can short-cut the quest for enlightenment if you just pray to the right dude. <br/>

      If the usual thing is for that 'exit' door to reveal itself only after a long karmic journey of enlightenment, then it does seem cheap to just ride into Nirvana on a Bodhisattva's coattails. I suspect that the incommunicable nature of enlightenment (seemingly a really big idea in Zen) means it doesn't actually work that way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But how cheap is it if a depressed cat with a wrench can manipulate his own universal destiny by being a good hacker? Cheap enough for Achewood, I hope!

      Two monks were arguing in the Temple yard. The first said, "The housewife buys the apple peeler to cook for her husband, because when she feeds him she arouses him." The second said "The housewife feeds her man because to feed him arouses her." <br/>

Joshu said: "Pussy is the bomb." In that moment, the monks were enlightened.

      What  <em>is</em>  Beef's choice? At first I thought he went back to the Wheel instead of returning to life, but then I realized that the comic doesn't really show that happening. I'm not sure that he didn't walk through the door into the room with Molly, allowing it to close behind him. Are the last two panels supposed to be ambiguous, or am I just bad at reading comics?

      I think the idea is that Beef is facing a doorway which leads to  <em>nothing</em> , which is what he's always wanted. But then we flash back to the people Beef cares about, and Beef closes the door, presumably to crawl back into the machine.

      where does that door lead to your interpretation? Into his and Molly's room? Or onto the street next to the burning Escalade? <br/> 
 <br/> 
If those aren't flashbacks, I guess the strip gives us about equal reason to think the door leads to either of those places. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I think it would be mighty weird, theologically speakin', for the "exit" from the Karma machine to lead right back into life.

      That vent is the "soul tube", as it were. In the last strip we saw him falling into it headfirst, and if the machine were working right, that same vent would have dumped him further down, into whatever fate karma chose for him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I assume once Beef got the machine doing what he wanted, his next move would be to crawl back into that busted vent and get to wherever it leads.

      Well, yeah, that much is clear. I'm saying the third option is to crawl back up out of the soul tube the way he came in. Instead of going through the karmic machine, or facing the choice CH left him with the door (obviously part of a plan to see if Beef will give up and go home), he's going to make up his own rules.

      The exit door with Molly on the other side seems to me like something the average Joe going through the wheels of Karma never gets to see; Beef only sees it because the machine fucked up. I presume that he turns back a) because he is feels wrong cheating death and is ready to die, or b) is aware of T's and Ray's death and is going to rig the Karmic wheels so he can go save them. B) seems pretty likely, and as some folks mention below, the title indicates such a gamble. <br/> 
And who knows why the machine fucked up it the first place. Maybe everyone has the option of breaking out of the machine, but I feel its more likely that Beef is unique here. Maybe it has to do with the strange power of the Lash of Thantos. Or, maybe this is Achewood, and this sort of shit just happens to Beef.

      Really? It made sense to me. I personally saw it that he opens the door and find that it inexplicably leads to his bedroom with Molly. He looks back, to verify that he is in the room with the machine ("I don't remember any sort of wheel of karmic sorting here but Ray he might have just bought it from SkyMall and not bothered to tell me") and, yes, there's the vent he just crawled out of. He looks back at Molly and -- and here is where I seem to be different from everyone else so far -- walks  <em>through</em>  the door to be with her. The omniscient narrator flashes to Ray, things are getting fucked up for his friends who were on their way to save him. He doesn't know anything about this as he returns to the comfort of the one he loves. The door closes on his choice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I find these other ideas quite interesting and I can see where people came from them, but it's so wildly different from my own interpretation. Maybe with all his recent focus on cramming in tons of panels, especially tons that slowly describe actions, Onstad needs to work a bit on his visual storytelling. This wouldn't be the first time recently that things have been really unclear on a basic level.

      I would agree with that last point for most of the wordless story telling here EXCEPT that that last line of panels seems to be intentionally ambiguous.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's hard to draw a line between "This artist is poor because everything is not clear cut" and "This artist is a genius because everything is ambiguous and left to our interpretation," but I'd say for that last line, he does good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And have we all neglected the title?  I'm pretty sure the gamble is going into the unknown, because after stepping out of a karma machine, a gamble doesn't lead you to get into bed with your wife and go to sleep.  Or at least to me.

      the visual story telling is pretty phat if you ask me.  Onstad doesn't spell everything out in clear binary logic.  To be able to follow the strip to some degree you have to get instead the character's heads and get inside Onstad's head.  That's pretty refreshing in a society where 99.99% of all media is written at an 8th grade reading level which these days is probably equivalent to a 5th grade reading level of just a few generations ago.

      I can give you the question of whether he goes through the door or not. That feels like something that might have been intended to be slightly vague. But the degree of uncertainty about the room itself? I think it's a probable weakness if people are thinking it was supposed to be a door into oblivion as opposed to a door back home. That something is occurring in Beef's head seems, in this work at least, to be something that ought to be communicated more clearly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, this isn't a work with an unreliable narrator where we're not supposed to be able to tell if something is real or just in their head. It just strikes me that when this sort of ambiguity comes up maybe it could have been done a bit better.

      I kind of saw it as he's looking in on Molly, thinking "How did this door get here?", kind of like belgand's thought of a recent SkyMall purchase.  But then we notice his head drop down and his eyes closed, much like he does when he thinks "I don't deserve this."  Roast Beef probably still believes that Molly is too amazing for him and that he doesn't deserve her love for him.  The flashback to the Escalade is, as said above, more than likely an omniscient narrator who wants to let everyone know that Ray and Teodor are still in Fucksville.  Now, I thought that even though Roast Beef believes he's not good enough for Molly, he still walked into their room to be with her.  That's just the romantic side of me talking.

      I don't know, I have a feeling he has some sort of glimpse into the fact that his friends are in trouble and he needs to help them (by going through the vent rather than just joining Molly).  I really want to believe that he's actually planning on taking some sort of action rather than just resigning himself to "fate." <br/>

Also, why in the world would the door lead to Molly?  It has to be some sort of illusion.

      see, that's why I never found the Eastern religions appealing... they're all on about how complete disconnection from the world is good... but I  <em>like</em>  the world. There are sunrises and kittens and boobies in the world. If there was some clear difference between oblivion and ascension, maybe I'd be into that, but as it is it just sounds kind of stupid, like switching off the lights in the Louvre because sometimes the glare gets in your eyes a little.

      this is a myth about religion, that it is the abandon of pleasure and joie de vivre, be it Eastern Buddhist monks or Western Christian monks.  Sure you have some folks who take things to an extreme and divest themselves of material things.  This does not mean that they are disconnected or that they don't feel emotions or joy or whatever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You also have, in both the east and the west, folks who become totally wrapped up in the material world who are spiritually bankrupt and whose spiritual happiness hinges totally on access to material artifacts and whose relationship with the world is superficial. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You can find enlightenment in Christianity just as well as in, for example, Buddhism.  You can also not find it.  Most people don't.  Most people don't even come close to finding it.  Enlightenment is a cultural perspective.  It is learned from others.  (hint...  probably not from Pat Robertson...)  I'm sure you have some people who have achieved some form of enlightenment all on their own without the benefit of learning it from others, but with all the shit of modern life I think that this is increasingly unlikely. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Enlightenment is a cultural perspective which is congruent with and built on a foundation of a physiological state of mind... a balanced state of mind...  when you measure the brain waves and when you chart the levels of brain activity of the various parts of the brain, there are significant differences when comparing the brain of someone who is enlightened vs the average schmuck. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think that the average schmuck can begin to understand even on a theoretical level what it is to be enlightened.  That's similar to trying to understand what an LSD trip is like without having ever experienced it first hand.  I've never done LSD, but maybe I've taken some baby steps towards enlightenment.  My anecdotal experience is that in studying and practicing the psychology of a religion or a world view, I started out with an abstract theoretical understanding of what 'inner peace' is and how it should inform my behavior, and this abstract understanding I have turns out to be at best a rough outline, at worst a false illusion.  'Enlightenment' is a pretty comprehensive descriptor that implies the totality of one's world view and one's self-awareness.  The experience of being enlightened with regard to X Y or Z is, by definition, something which one can not begin to understand if one is not thusly enlightened...  Whatever abstract idea or model you might have about 'enlightenment' came from a source which it's self  <em>did not have a clue</em>  or, if it did, then you  <em>were not paying attention.</em>   Enlightenment in this or that subject, by definition, is not something which can be understood in the abstract, it is something which is either experienced, or is not.  Enlightenment is like riding a bicycle in that the theory and the experience are two different things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is it necessary to have random unpredictable emotional and ideological vagaries of the mind to keep one's life interesting?  I propose that it is not...  the world is already more than interesting enough in it's own right without the benefit of schizophrenic patriotic egotistical bureaucratic neurotic idiocy with which to interpret and engage one's external environment.

      sorry, didn't mean you in particular, just meant you as in us in general.  I meant when we get ideas about Western style or Eastern style enlightenment from people, those ideas are usually patently false, or, if the ideas are true, then we're usually ill-prepared to understand these ideas.  The problem with enlightenment is that it's such a radically different world view and physiological state of mind that you can't get there from here, at least, not directly.  So often we see descriptions of what enlightenment is, when all we can hope to understand would be descriptions of the intermediate stages, or rather, of what for one as a particular individual would be the next particular stage towards enlightenment.  Hmmm... I guess that explains why I love shows like the Teletubbies so much...  Either I've got a long long ways to go towards enlightenment, or I'm already there...  It's hard to say really... that one's a close call... <br/>

      The problem I have with religion (all religion) is that it has an unshakeable otherworldly focus. The Buddha, for instance, achieves enlightenment, and that means he leaves the world behind for some sort of oblivion/perfection. Insofar as other enlightened beings hang around, it's only so we can follow them. There's never any room for the people who want to hang around and make  <em>this</em>  into a better place, rather than going to some other place which may or may not be better.

      Once again, I don't want to be the dude who can't not talk about religion, but I gotta say that that's not what Christianity at least (and I'm sure pretty much every other major religion that manages to not self-destruct) is all about. Yes, the first rule is Love God, but the very next thing out of The Dude's mouth is "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Matt. 22:39 for all you who want to keep track at home). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Christianity ain't about judging, it's about loving. Sometimes...some would say quite often, but I don't think that's the case...it's extremely difficult to love some people, and sometimes we "forget" to love some people, and some people who call themselves Christians don't know that they're supposed to love every people, but that's the way it SHOULD be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now why it ain't that way is a whole different story.

Beef is imagining that these things may transpire if he is not there for Molly and for his friends... The "Exit" door represents nihilism, a state of mind with which Beef has often flirted.  "Exit" is turning your back on your fate, and is ceasing to exist.

      But does Beef even exist at this moment? He seems corporeal, tangible; if he walked through the exit, would he not be walking back into his world?  If he turns back and re-enters  the Wheel, does his life not begin anew, leaving behind his life as it was (the life with Ray and Molly)?

I thought the Exit door was an escape from Death, back into the Life he was just living, and, opening the door and seeing these two scenes, he's taking his chances with reincarnation instead.

      He's not 'imagining' anything. He's seeing what he's leaving in this world- his wife sleeping, and his friends about to be incinerated- and making the choice which way he's going. The ties that bind will likely pull him back to finish his life. <br/>

 When a person is in both worlds simultaneously, they are capable of what's commonly referred to as miraculous deeds and shit. Apparently Onstad knows something of it.

      I see people going back and forth on this, and after absorbing everyone's observations I'm coming down on the side of (a) what's outside the door is the Void and (b) Molly and the burning Escalade are third-person interstitials to help us orient ourselves in time, not things Beef is seeing either literally or in his mind's eye. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He chooses to turn his back on the sweet release of nothingness all on his own. He chooses to get on with being reborn, or perhaps to keep wrenching the karma machine, not because he actively knows that he needs to save his friends or stand by his wife but simply because true oblivion has turned out to be less alluring than he might have imagined. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Next I suppose we'll find out whether this means he's passed Cartilage Head's obscure test or failed it.

      What you're not noticing is the background difference. On the one side of the door, you have stark black background. On the other side, you have pale grey. <br/>

      I did notice that, but I guess I'm reading it differently. Do you see him as passing through the door or heading back the way he came? To my eyes the "inside" (where the karma machine lives) is gray, and the "outside" (the Void, or whatever) is black. To me it looks like Beef chooses not to go outside.

      I think we can both agree that he he chooses not to go into the black area, whether that be Void, or Life. <br/>

I hope your interpretation is correct. But it looks to me like he turned his back on the big, messy, beautiful thing called life and is going back to get raped by the karma machine for a bit.

      I was tempted at first to interpret Molly and the Escalade as "existing" beyond the door somehow because those frames share the black background color, but I decided against that interpretation. Mostly because it requires an extra step: explaining how Beef can "see" the crash he doesn't know about.

      Think about what're seeing as being shown partly through Beef's eyes.  Panel 1 shows the exit, then panel 2 shows us Beef looking at the exit out of frame.  That's a standard visual storytelling device, in film studies you'd call it a shot reverse shot.  In 6 through 8 we don't see Beef's eyes at all, then in panel 9 we see him looking out of frame again.  This suggests we're meant to interpret panel 10 as the reverse of the previous panel; a shot showing us what Beef is looking at.  Panels 11 and 12 definitely work this way since we see Beef looking behind himself and then a reverse shot of what he sees: the metal re-birthing canal that we know is located behind him.  So if panels 9-12 represent two shot reverse shot sequences then what's explains the panel with the burning Escalade?  That I dunno, but notice in the previous panel that Beef's eyes are closed so it would seem he can't literally be seeing the Escalade.  Either he has a vision of it in his mind's eye (Not unreasonable given the divine setting) or it's a cutaway shot which changes our POV for a panel.

      I am sorry to have to be the one to point this out, but Beef did not go into the room with Molly.  The door does not have a "closer thingy" up by the hinge.  The strip clearly shows the door still open with no Beef on the bedroom side.  The door is moving because we hear (see) the "creeee" noise.  The only way that door can be moving is if Beef is on the other side of it pushing it closed.  Besides, his facial expression in panel 14 foreshadows his decision.  He  <em>knows</em>  that he can not just go back into the bedroom like nothing happened.  It don't roll that way for such as...

      It doesn't need one. Doors can close due to their own weight or perhaps Beef pulls it slightly closed as he goes through. These are all reasonable things to happen. <br/>

Still, good insight and reasonable support to your interpretation.

      I think everyone is wrong. It seems to me quite obvious that the room with Molly is a peaceful afterlife, and the panel showing the car on fire is showing the cat's other choice: to go back into the room and have the chance to save his friends. He makes the choice to go back, and hope that peace can come later. He is not a cat to deserve a dying friend.

      I think that the 'gamble' Beef takes is: he stands on the threshold of returning to his life and the people who need him, and the obvious way to go is  <em>thattaway</em> . But he takes a gamble and does something else. I wonder if he has figured out how to work the Karma machine, and wants to hack some changes? Such as making Ray and Téodor not die in a car accident? I guess we'll find out.

      The more intense and dramatic this arc gets, the more justified it seems in its hijacking of the sapphic erotica arc. I was disoriented by the sudden shift at first but am becoming intrigued as to where this is all headed.

      But was the arc hijacked?  I mean, Beef being dressed in a poorly ventilated elephant suit MCing a lesbian erotica porn writing competition with a poorly (to put it kindly) prepared teleprompter script...  is about as meaningless as life can get...  The dude and his bride still live in Ray's pool house, don't they?  If they moved out then I missed that blog post or whatever.  But either way, this Karma arc is about Beef choosing to find and accept some kind of personal meaning in his life that is of his own conception, instead of just going along with the ideas, projects, whims and fancies of his friends, and instead of just being prodded forward in his world view by his own insecurities and cares rooted in his own ego.  This arc may be about Beef finally fully forming his own vision, a vision which is enlightened, which begins to transcend his own damaged experience...  Finally truly coming to terms with his own life and his own inevitable death...  That's something he has to do on his own, something which all too many fail to do, always choosing as we do to walk through that "exit" door at every available opportunity, escaping awareness through watered down mass market top-40 drugs, sex, and rock 'n roll.   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415014002/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YILBP7bnRMk">Sing fur sie Katie Couric.</a>

      I can agree with much of your analysis, 8 - the bizarre, Ray-centered situation Beef had been dragged into as the last minute MC of that contest was all-too typical of the kind of crap he's had to put up with in his lifetime of loyal friendship to Ray. It is a reasonable conclusion that the contest was only so much chaos and noise for the purpose of providing something from which to escape%u2026 a %u201Cperfect example%u201D if you will of his life%u2019s turmoil. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However I suspect that this much is only obvious with hindsight. At the time of CH's intervention I felt that events were becoming overly complex and directionless. It seemed like the contest was the %u201Creal%u201D story and that it was not being given a satisfactory conclusion. Now that this second act has sufficiently unfolded the direction is perhaps easier to see.

      I wish I could get away with making death threats.  that would be some killer performance art.  no pun intended.  Like, take a bunch of knitting needles and poke them through a chicken and send it in a box to Onstad.  Like, a cooler.  A small one so the postage is cheaper.  And put some dry ice in it too.  Maybe fedex it instead of mail it to avoid any kind of federal offense against post office rules of sending dead chickens.  It would have to be a feathered chicken though.  Complete with legs.  But cut the legs and the head off and put them in three zip lock bags and then tape the zip lock bags onto the chicken where the head and the legs normally go.  And write a message to onstad scrawled in magic marker on the inside of the cooler... like  <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em> {quote] "Dear Chris will you please autograph my chicken and send him back to me I am your number one FAN I made you who you are today I will never forgive you if you don't sign my chicken so I suggest that you do it</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
yeah that would be pretty impressive.  but that would probably not be allowed because mayeb it could be construed as a death threat against if not onstad himself then at least maybe against his pet chicken or something

      actually, neonfreon thus far is an enigma.  he has a dead guy for an avatar and he does seem a little socially maladroit.  Also I can't remember if it was further up or further down in the comments or if it was the comments of the last strip, but he said he didn't want to talk about himself and wanted to change the subject.

      also, AIU thinks he has used neonfreon's real-life picture as his avatar (a1u), and is annoyed at the lack of reaction from neonfreon, but hasn't directly stated it on assetbar.  He just posts a bunch of pictures of dicks/guys without shirts instead

      I'm not annoyed.  I did google for neonfreon and grabbed the first pic I found, but the chances of it being him are still pretty small, and even if it was, he still might not respond.  It seems you reverse engineered my stalking to see if you'd find the same pic?  I mean, seriously... if that's what you did, then you think like a stalker.  If you were a computer programmer that would be understandable but you're into literature and writing.  Doing a character study on hackers?  what gives? <br/>

      sorry about that.  I probably won't do it again for at least another few months.  It's interesting to me to fuck shit up, but it's pointless to pull the same stunt day in and day out. <br/>

I hope you can get a better internet plan and/or a better mobile device. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry America for clogging your cell phone towers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
if you tried to dial 911 and you couldn't that might have been my fault for forgetting how much AT&T has it's head up it's ass and how merely coughing on the line is wont to bring an entire cell tower down. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not to mention AT&T gives the government access to all of it's internet traffic so now there is a CIA hard drive somewhere in a secret room with all that garbage on it.  That probably cost $5 worth of storage space alone knowing how government contracting works, and that will wind up costing our grand kids $50 by the time the loan for the hard drives gets paid back to China et al. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That reminds me... I was going to ask if you're on an iphone...  if you are, fuck you for supporting a company that supports illegal government wire taps, if not, then sorry for fucking up your bandwidth.

      Actually, you reverse engineered my stalking.  I found that pick of neonfreon ages ago; you think I would've somehow seen that pic in your avatar and assumed, out of all the people on assetbar you hate (especially the guy you think I am), that it was neonfreon?  I knew who it was before you did.  I don't even have to try.  You're so predictable, it's pathetic.

      It is my pleasure to amaze you.  I still like to feel it is ambiguous though.  In the third row he is holding the door open, so you can guess it closes by itself.  There's Molly in front, there's the karma duct behind.  There's the blink of... resignation?  ...resolution?  Then the door is shutting and you don't see any of RB.  So to me that is ambiguous, he could have walked into or out of the room.  I think out, based on personality and story line and such.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
P.S. Sorry, I'm sure this is discussed somewhere in that troll jungle up there, I just didn't bring my machete...

      I'll probably be proved wrong, but it seemed clear to me that he closed the door without going through. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Facial expression was his sadness as he thought "no, not for me - back to death I go". He can't know about the Escalade, so it's not a resigned/resolved "okay I gotta do a thing first" facial expression.

      Wouldn't the upside-down Escalade on fire with at least one cat involved be considered a Schrodinger's box? At least in the context shown here? Even conceding that anything still in that car would be dead now, there is still the chance that Teodor dragged Ray out through those sealed, broken windows without our seeing. So then, would that box be the car, the entirety of the strip to this point, or just that particular panel?

      Fortunately I had a book to read as I sat here waiting for the page to reload, so I could hit "Ignore User" again. After a couple of iterations of this my laptop stopped choking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even more fortunately, there's still witty banter and intelligent discussion in here, both of the comic and of shoes and ships and the universe and everything. That sort of thing was why I created an account a few days back. <br/>

      I dunno, I wouldn't say "devastated". Hell, I wouldn't even go so far as to cop to the smoldering, teeth-grinding irritation that is a troll's catnip. Mostly this kind of crap is a vaguely baffling annoyance, like mild car trouble or a ten-second brownout in spring. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On another note entirely, it occurs to me on like my seventy-eighth rereading of this strip that Beef opens the door to sees Molly sleeping, closes his eyes, opens them again to see the burning Escalade, and then shuts the door . . . except the order of the panels doesn't quite support that, now I look again (seventy-ninth time?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
And as I typed this I initially capitalized it as "the Burning escalade". Which is totally a French/Caribbean fusion dish waiting to happen.

      Actually, the best part is that I ignored glad some way back in the archives, and so had to click just to see what you were responding to. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Wait, no, the really  <em>bestest</em>  part is that I didn't say word one about glad up there, not the merest hint of a mention, and in fact wasn't even thinking of him when I went on the engine-lights-and-brownouts tangent. But, meh. They say the ancient Greeks treated headaches by simply ignoring them until they went away.
