      I feel like there's not a lot to say about such an event. My grasp on the physics of such an event, of course, is not the mightiest, but the impression received is that that sort of thing would not leave a lot behind that had a consistency more solid than, say, air freshener.

      If I were to write such a thing, it would start much like this: <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the cool early morning sea breeze, I awoke to the sun peeking happily through my window. I donned my uniform and made my way out the deck, where the arrival and departure of jet powered aircraft was a common occurrence. This particular day, however, I was to have an unfortunate inquest with a rather foul-tempered F-14 and his posse, the Twin Turbine Opium Engine Twins. I cannot quite explain exactly how events transpired to contribute to my untimely demise, but I can expound upon how I came to enter and exit promptly through this marvel of -- *whircrunchCRASH* "OH HEAVENS" *whirhummmcrunchbzzzzzzz*

      And yet, believe it or not, the dude survived. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Luckily, the plane had just been shut off and the engines were spooling down.  They still had just enough suction to draw the poor flight deck sap into the turbine, and his body absorbed most of the rest of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Had they been going full-speed, your comment would certainly be horrifyingly accurate.

      Wanna know what I wish I could un-see? "Three Guys, One Hammer". Awh man... it's like... it's like it's worse than anything on Rotten.com, and it's worse than Two Girls, One Cup, but it's not as bad as One Guy, One Jar, or that one with the guy and the horse...  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But yeah, to spoil the video for you (Unless you really want to watch it, in which I implore that you take caution, as it is considered 'bad for the soul' by many), these two Ukrainian guys kill a guy with a hammer and a screwdriver and film it, and you see the human body do things that are pretty fucking terrible.

      I love the baffled look on Ray's face in panel 4. Its saying, "Why would my very good friend, Roast Beef, not want to look at this picture of a guy who got killed by a helicopter?"
