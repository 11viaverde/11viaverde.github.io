      "from circumstances" is the best line I've ever picked up from Achewood, I've been using it since this comic first ran. Wordsmithing at its best.

      Beef was probably treated as more of a runt than Showbiz <br/>

      I think it just goes to show that even the slightest change in circumstances changes a man so much.  Beef is who he is because he had Ray as his friend growing up, and unlike Showbiz didn't channel his depression through tequila and car stereos.

      What I love is that Showbiz is basically an impoverished Ray. Dude's got no ways, no means, and only a sign and some ketchup packets to his name, but he's always partying. Compare to Ray who has the same demeanor but has crazy luck and the Net Worth of Eurasia.

      I like to think that my cat comes from Circumstances. She was a rescue cat. They were going to put her down because she wasn't a cute kitten anymore. She says 'motherfucker'. A lot.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like to think that Onstad probably picked up Beef later, in private. Because privately is how you should snorgle a cat like Beef.

      It's actually affecting; it looks as though the mention of his upbringing has made him think about things he prefers to never think about, and at that moment he's about a hair's breadth away from a complete emotional breakdown. Fortunately he manages to rein it in.

      I love how, after Beef agrees that he went through a lot of shit, he pauses, as it to reflect on the fact that Onstad, as his cartoonist, is the sole reason he actually came from Circumstances. At least that's how I saw it.
