      He was totally distant from her for a long time.  Sex is an important part of relationships, and he was denying her that closeness.  Then he gets jealous and destroys something she loves when he stopped giving her love in the first place.  He failed to see the interconnectedness of love and sex.

      Sometimes holding hands, little pecks on the cheek, a light back rub (fully clothed) can be so arousing and so much more conducive to making you like and trust a person than sex ever could. <br/>

Of course, you could do all these things and at the end it could all still be a lie :(

      Agreed a million times over with the above comments. Sometimes a tender caress on the neck or turning to hold someone's hand is all the intimacy a person could ever want.  However, sometimes it's awesome to just get mad rutty. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Chester 5000 comic really, honestly touched me...the depth of emotion and caring, the passion, the dedication to each other...robot or no, that was pure romance.  As someone who lives in a similar environment as the Scientist and his wife, it quite honestly broke my heart in spots.  Intimacy both includes and far surpasses sex. Perhaps I'm a naive romantic, but I truly believe that if you have devoted love and true intimacy that includes sex, you will have the depths of all of the universe unfurled before you.

      You just secured a chubby for not spelling anything in there poorly. <br/>

      It's not like people were complaining for no reason. For the most part, people around here give reasons as to why they don't like something. It's not "thiz strip suckors!1!" or "I hate u, onstade!", it tends to be much more reasonable "I thought this arc could have been a little better" or "This part could've been resolved a bit more clearly." In fact, most of the response to the arc was very positive, it was just the ending that some people weren't sold on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A writer can't expect people to eat up everything they give them, nor can they expect them to be perfectly happy with loose ends. Also, writers are more likely than not to be less critical of their work than their readers, but only the most arrogant would assume their works are perfect and beyond criticism (like that bitch who does Anne Rice). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I'm mostly just saying. More likely than not, this is just Onstad being snarky, as men tend to be, not a case of "You peons don't deserve my genius!"

      <em>Laurell</em>  K Hamilton, but you're right: no author loves their own creations quite as intensely (and, perhaps, literally) as Hamilton. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I actually read through most of the Anita Blake series.  The first several books are laughably bad, and definitely show the signs of a novice author: stereotypical characters, mishandled plot constructs, forced atmosphere. But then, briefly, for one or two books, she's showed a lot of promise and they started to get almost... good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But by that point Hamilton was hopelessly in love with all of her characters, and the series quickly plummeted into the abyss of literary auto-lingus.

      I've no problem with long, intricate strips, and I'm happy with one or two strips a week, but the only parts of this whole arc I really liked were the one-liners. Maybe I've gotten jaded, but for me this strip exemplifies the inelegance of the whole. It's not particularly bad, but the storytelling has suffered... <br/>

      You presume too much. First, 4 months is a very arbitrary amount of time. By then, people probably wouldn't care about the arc either way. Next, Achewood has traditionally had an extremely positive fanbase. This isn't the sort of place where the people would suddenly decide one day that the strip isn't as good as it used to be, it would be, and was, a gradual process. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, how is pointing out all of the loose ends hyper-scrutinizing? And how is reading the whole arc, waiting for the arc to end, and then evaluating the arc "opinion making without any context"?

      I respectfully disagree. I just agree that it's obscure and difficult, but isn't that half the fun? <br/> 
 <br/> 
CH's accusations of cowardice are actually the stripping away of illusions. For Ray, it was the illusion that he's a stone-cool mack-daddy good person hero of the day. He was a coward who deserted a 'dying man'. For Beef, the illusion was that he romanced death and wished himself dead. He's morbid, but his curiosity and desire to fix broken stuff ruled the day, and the dying man he abandoned was himself, making it a nifty twist on the Cartilage Head routine, and putting CH in an interesting position as the Zen Master of performance-art mind-fuckery. He apparently does it to people for their own good, to wake them up about their own unhelpful assumptions about themselves.

      To clarify a little bit concerning my previous suggestions, I don't want every punchline to be "...boned?", but there is a beauty in that simplicity, and I think it's a greater beauty than that created by these huge grandiose plots. My favorite part about achewood has always been how realistically the characters interact, and even though that genuineness is still there, it seems overshadowed by all the circumstances coming down upon them. Even the zanier plots of yore, like Lazarus Loafer or Ray in Hell are all tied down by the characters' involvement and reasonableness throughout it all. What the hell was this? Elephant costumes (lol so randum XD)? Wheel of Karma? Lash of Thanatos? The characters seemed secondary to all the Big Things happening, when they should be the ones drving the action and plot. Ray in Hell had a hilarious and satisfying conclusion, making the wait worth it. This storyline meandered forever, and the conclusion is basically calling us all nit-picking geeks for wanting a more thorough explanation. Shorter strips allow them to run more frequently, which keeps the story moving and interest high, and shorter strips and story arcs are just naturally more satisfying. A short strip, at best, is a perfectly executed rimshot, but long strips are just rimshots preceded by a drumroll. It becomes harder for it to end satisfyingly and gracefully and make it all worth it. And I don't necessarily want all of them to be funny, but if they aren't funny, at least have them be for the sake of character development.

      Unfortunate, that the comment I was responding to has been lamed away. My post is now a punchline without a setup. A dreary soul on these "internets" we call home, pangs of loss haunting it like a phantom limb.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Soon, it will turn to drinking. Hoping the solution to the emptiness it feels will lie at the bottom of the next bottle, or perhaps the one after that. It will grow tired of interactions with happy people, finding such meetings to be nothing more than reminders of a former, now-unattainable life.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
My comment will fall out of favor with its friends and family, as they one by one recognize it as a lost cause and give up on trying to pull it from despair. My comment will be unsurprised, as this will only confirm its inescapable self-doubts.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
My comment will contemplate suicide, but will decide against it when it realizes that no one would mourn its passing.

      It's true though.  Any guy I dated had a cat and they were douchebags with mother issues and social/emotional problems.  Then again, maybe I just attract douchebags.  But!  They had cats. <br/>

I love cats though, but I think it's less creepy when women have cats.

      My favorite part of the "...boned" comic is that it's dramatic in a way I am familiar with.  I was baby sitting a slew of children and the youngest at three tugged on my sleeve when we were all eating pizza and the other children were distracted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He said to me, "Casey, did you know people are made out of *pauses and glances around and lowers his voice* booones?"  I smiled and told him yes, yes I did and he just nodded solemnly glancing at the others at the table who had no idea. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Years later I was baby sitting him and his older siblings who were doing homework as I was.  All of a sudden something is vibrating on my back and it's the little boy.  I go, "Where did you find this back massager?  You're so nice for giving me a back rub!" and he said "Mommy keeps it in her drawer I'm not allowed in!"  I had to quietly and discreetly lead him back to his parents room where thankfully the "back massager" was the only thing disturbed.  I did not look in the drawer I just made sure he put it back.

      After my grandmother died, my mother flew in from out of state to help her brothers clear out their parent's house.  While cleaning, they found my grandmother's  <em>device</em> , made the appropriate uncomfortable jokes, and disposed of it. <br/> 
When my mother left town, she had to change her plane ticket, which prompted a random luggage search in a separate room, with my mother watching from the other side of a fence.  Inside my mother's luggage, beyond the several pounds of cheese curds she was taking home (local delicacy), they found the  <em>device</em> , which my uncle had surreptitiously stowed in there when she wasn't looking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The cheese made it home.  The  <em>device</em>  was now TSA property.

      The only thing holding this arc together was the possibility of a brilliant resolution, and a brilliant resolution this ain't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like Lost. I don't like it anymore because I don't trust that the writers know what they're doing anymore. I think Onstad got into deep waters here and, instead of coming up with something amazing, copped out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, this whole strip seems like some sarcastic commentary on "oh you silly readers, you want a  <strike>logical</strike>  plausible ending, watch me play with your preconceived notions" to cover up the fact that Onstad doesn't have a fucking clue where this was going.

      Beef deserted his own dying self... I don't think you can complain about needing some guidance and then miss the main obvious focal point of the entire fucking arc. Maybe you just need to reread it? And pay attention? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, don't get me wrong, this wasn't my favorite arc of all time, but it was way more than a blind foray into pointless minutiae--it was a relatively deep look into the psyche of one of the main characters of the strip.

    <span class="comment-text hideable">
      How exactly did Beef "desert" himself?  In Ray's case, desertion meant leaving a man to die because he (Ray) was too scared to do something about it.  What does it mean in this case?  Is the betrayal that Beef lives after he promised to die?  But who is he betraying? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess what I am still having trouble with is CH's motivation.  Is he an existential bad cop, showing us our weaknesses and our failings? Or is he just a parasitic and vindictive creature, who relies on others for his subsistence, and then shames them when they bail on the admittedly creepy rigmarole he puts them through?  I'm inclined to believe he's the latter. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Either way, I still find this storyline unsatisfying.  As I said, if he's meant to be teaching Beef some personal truth about himself, I'm utterly lost about what that truth is, and I don't buy that Beef wouldn't ask the same question.  Sure, Existential Cop CH would have lied, but it bothers me that Beef didn't ask, because the realization (via the card telling him he is a coward) that this whole set-up was just an elaborate lesson for Beef falls flat; we never knew what to expect from CH, so we weren't surprised when he threw us a curve ball.  And if CH is a parasite, we don't know what he plans to gain from Beef's death.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the Ray storyline, CH's weirdness is a slow burn, and it seems innocent enough at first.  This storyline involved an elaborate plan that seemingly had no purpose.  Even if it hadn't been sabotaged, it's unclear what the result of this whole mess would have been. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, I guess my overarching question is, if this was meant as a look into Roast Beef's psyche, what did we see there?  What did it reveal about him? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Finally, I love that we're able to have a discussion like this about a webcomic.  The fact that Achewood is even deserving of this kind of analysis is pretty amazing and exciting.

      I think that the idea is that since Beef is so depressed, reincarnation is something he should want to do.  Like, 'if you hate your life, do something about it.' <br/> 
Onstad underscores this in the last strip, when Beef chooses to "flip the switch negative on today".  We're reminded that he's not a happy creature.   <br/> 
So he abandoned himself in that he chose not to take positive action to change his life.  Of course, that's an oversimplification, since there are good things and people in his life too, and he didn't know whether what he would be reborn as would have been good or bad, but it is, to my understanding, what Cartilage Head means. <br/> 
As for why Cartilage Head would do this to Beef . . . Who knows, maybe he felt he was helping.  Maybe he just wanted to reach out to one of his fans. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I'm probably largely wrong about all that, but that's the conclusion I came to.

      At the risk of receiving the scorn of one or two stoned hipsters  <em>on the Internet:</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Listen, as someone who reads and enjoys a comic strip for free on the Internet and has purchased merchandise based on this comic  <em>as is implied in the social contract herein</em> , I think Onstad knew he was just wandering about, waiting for something to happen.  He was like, "shit, Sapphic poetry content, where do I go from there" and at 2 AM one day was all "I GOT IT!" and suddenly Cartilage Head was once more with us.  A panicked creative decision that spirals into something worse: everyone who has (metaphorically) put pen to paper has gotten themselves into a situation like this at one time or another.  Most of us, however, don't do so publicly, in real-time, with a feedback mechanism available to their audience. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sir: you hosed this but good, but I appreciate the  <em>mea culpa.</em>   Walk it off, son. <br/> 
 <br/> 
LET'S HEAR IT FOR CHRIS ONSTAD, LADIES AND GENTS.  HUZZAH.  OBAMA '08: BECAUSE WE CAN.  CHOCOLATE LOVE, Y'ALL.

      I hadn't really seen it as a mea culpa, more as the (for Onstad) crude last gasp of an ill-fated arc. However, I think I like your interpretation better, so I'm taking it. I guess I'm trying to say "thank you"? <br/> 
 <br/> 
As an aside, I find it amusing that the protestations of devotion to and affection for the comic accompany any comment remotely critical of Onstad to the point where they become as predictable as the abuse which would ensue without them. Of course, sometimes the abuse ensues anyway...

      My biggest bugaboo: I wanted the man in seat Z-1 to be some kind of past figure for Beef.  Maybe not like Ramses meeting Ray at the fence at the GOF, but something like, maybe the homeless guy who asked him to write a letter for him in that one Christmas Eve strip?  Other than that I'm fine with how this all turned out.  I know you all wanted to know my Ideas.

      I thought this arc was going to turn out great, by the way, when I saw that one of the options on the Wheel of Samsara was "octocephaly."  Roast Beef would return as an eight-headed creature, with each head scornful of the one on its left and envious of the one on its right.  But then I realized that it actually said "otocephaly," and I felt really, really bad.

      When I was a student, I cut my hair with a cheap Bic razor, which only had one blade in those days.  I grab a hunk, then slice a hunk off.  Worked great.  Looked like shit, but that was the style.

      if someone with downs syndrome or some such similar thing started posting on Assetbar, how would you know?   <br/>

We can all recognize the stereotypical speech slur of downs syndrome, but is there a recognizable component to downs syndrome message board prose?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am tempted to join a downs syndrome support group mailing list to find out...  but I'm also lazy.  It's gonna have to be one of those projects for when I'm incredibly bored and have more time on my hands and the loli hentai chat room goes down. <br/>

      new question:  At what age is it okay to allow your daughter to revel in slutty femininity.  I'm not saying to actually fuck around but to do everything but.  Flirt and dress like a slut and so on.  How do you differentiate slutty femininity from 'normal' socially acceptable femininity.  If you want to support your daughter in her own individuality but one also also wants to provide a good healthy structure and environment for her growing up, where do you draw the line and say to her that she is okay being who she is and you support her or that she is a slut and if she doesn't stop it you're going to beat her?  (Or whatever form of discipline your MO calls for.) <br/>

      I sometimes wonder if any women get sexually aroused from giving birth?  Ya know... think about it... there's how many billion people on earth?  Every last one of them had to be given birth to.  Maybe minus a few where the mother was out cold on anesthetics for a c section or some such.  But then add a bunch for all the miscarriages and still births and so on that never made it into the general population.  So out of all those billions of bitches giving birth, you know at least some of them have to get mad horny as all hell about it.  All rubbing the bloody placenta all over their titties and such.  Are you still reading?  Why are you still reading this?  What the fuck is wrong with you? <br/>

      that placenta is for my use. that's right. i told that doctor that i wanted it carted out to me on a metal wheelie-tray with those chocolate-brown sporks and knives they have down in the hospital's cafeteria. that plan never came to fruition, as i was bedside when it departed but hellz yes i took that thing in my hands and tore into that mother (heh) like there weren't 15 mortified, yelling people actively becoming ill. i chortled and roared afterwards, pretending like i was a Tyrannosaurus rex complete with particles of previous prey still betwixt my teeth, pink lines of saliva running this way and that. i began stomping down the hall and around the floor's waiting room, opening and closing my jaws, chomping at other visitors and their terrified five-year-old sons. i felt charged with incredible energy. the street below began to blur. maybe it was just a psychological reaction to my new child. maybe it was the fact that MY new family had NO way of supporting itself or that i hadn't slept during those thirty six hours of labor. wait, was the nurse doing a James Earl Jones impression? the lamps slant. a snake rode a motorcycle seven mile-- <br/> 
 <br/> 
when i came to, i was in a bed next to my wife, still sporting my new half-red Hanes. i reached out to her and she handed our baby child over to me where i cradled it until the hungries struck. <br/>

      this, that which he mentions, in this explanatory statement, is true, meaning many commas may be utilized, improperly, not entirely unlike your typical, poorly-written indie film's script, making its contrived plot, at the very, very least, difficult to follow, much less enjoyable, what with the juxtaposed filmography of a billowing ex-Broadway ballerina, blubbering justifiably when subjected to bellows of an uber-objective director, which more often than not concluded in sobs from the primadonna, confirming the entire production and the lives of everyone involved are a sham and a mistake, if not a crime against the glorious, storied artform of film, as well as against humanity.

      Every time I look at the Magistrate of the Quarternary I can't help but think of  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415013836/https://pbfcomics.com/?cid=PBF233-Psychoanalyst.jpg">this</a>   <em>Perry Bible Fellowship</em>  strip. And that makes me happy.

      I knew the Magistrate reminded me of something, but until you posted that link I couldn't put my finger on what it was. A v-chub for you.

      I feel semi-vindicated that I'd predicted Beef's reincarnation as a Magreaux dog.  Not that any of it matters since the wheel was made from strew off parts of old K-cars.  CH can afford to tool around in a sweet Fokker tri-plane, but can he fashion a wheel of reincarnation that anyone who's ever owned a Ronco pocket-fisherman wouldn't reject?  Nooooooo.

      it's not like those machines are mass-produced. it can run all post-WWII tin with milky white paint and graying black. i mean, it's not like History needs it or anything.

      so I have this box of zatarains new orleans style chicken gumbo rice mix, and it comes with the rice.  Well, the rice it comes with is shit.  most american rice is shit, actually.  so I had to do my best to pick the rice out of the rice mix so I could put the rice mix in with some Basmati rice in the rice steamer.  fortunately the seasoning mix was not completely mixed with the shit zatarains rice so I didn't get too much shit rice mixed in and I didn't loose too much seasoning.  I should put the shit zatarains rice in an envelope and mail it back to them.  "here is your shit rice you assholes I would rather eat anthrax than this shit"
