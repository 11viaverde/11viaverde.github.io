      Actually, the cooking oil thing is genuine. People have converted diesel-powered vehicles to run on discarded cooking oil, which can usually be obtained free from restaurants. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, obviously it's only free because there's no demand. If everyone did it, it would become pricier --  but it would have to be economically and environmentally sounder than petroleum.

      It wouldn't be that much pricier. If your McDonald's and Burger Kings are already tapped, you can buy "feed oil" which is stuff that isn't high enough quality to cook in, so they feed it to cows. <br/> 
I once read a brief study that talked about using a kind of oil-producing _algae_ that could be grown in hydroponics tanks in areas that wouldn't support corn or whatever. <br/> 
Waste vegetable oil is actually one of the best options out there for a renewable resource. Or bio-diesel if you want it to run in regular, probably-more-efficient engines. <br/> 
Diesel is inherently less fuel-efficient when it comes to stop and start city driving though, so the actual ideal would be a plug-in diesel hybrid, using electricity for starting and diesel once the engine's ready to go into its narrow ideal RPM range.

      However, if you're talking about using feed oil or stuff like that on a large-scale basis you also have to consider the financial and environmental cost of growing, fertilizing, harvesting, and refining the grain, which in the US is probably corn and is supported by massive government subsidies.

      <em>I was looking for you when I first heard the sirens<br/>
The ambulances filled the streets<br/>
The masses screamed and called for help<br/>
You were no where next to me<br/>
The soldiers came to round up the living<br/>
And take them away to somewhere that's safe<br/>
But if I can't find you there's no place to save me<br/>
If you are gone then it's too late<br/>
<br/>
Night turns to dawn, and dawn into day<br/>
And the land overflows with the dead<br/>
Where did I last hold you in my arms?<br/>
What was the last thing that you said?<br/>
Some hide underground, others hide in a mall<br/>
I still drag myself through the streets<br/>
I life without love my love isn't a life to me<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe that love can rot away<br/>
So first aim for the heart, then aim for the head</em>

      In order to run a normal diesel engine on vegetable oil, you need to first separate out the glycerin, thus converting it into biodiesel. If you want to use pure, unmodified vegetable oil, you need to make certain modifications to the engine, otherwise the glycerine (which is the stuff they make soap out of) will make a mess of your engine.

      I have a truck I modified to run on waste vegetable oil back when hurricane Katrina screwed up all the gas prices.  The main problems with running on regular WVO is that it will loosen up all the gunk in your fuel tank/fuel lines, giving you hell of problems for the first hundred miles or so.  After that, you need to worry about any rubber fuel lines or seals.  While all tihs is happening, the only problem is making sure the oil itself is warm enough to flow like normal Diesel fuel. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would say that modifying your vehicle and filtering the vegetable oil for it (when done correctly. CORRECTLY!!!) is easier, safer, and cheaper than dealing with brewing biodiesel yourself.

      oil doesn't have glycerin in it.  Glycerin is a product of the esterification reaction (oil methanol lye) that creates biodiesel. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Normal cars can run on straight vegetable oil as long as the engine is heated up and the oil is not clouded (above 40 degrees, typically). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, if you do get fouled up, it is typically just the fuel filter, as it intercepts the large pieces before it gets into the engine. <br/>

      The point is basically that a hydrogen car is essentially an electric car with a fancy sort of battery. <br/> 
Water and electricity are available to every gas station, so it wouldn't be too hard to upgrade them to produce and compress hydrogen. <br/> 
And while burning fossil fuels at a power plant is more efficient and cleaner than inside a car, we can also upgrade the grid with capacity from nice, clean sources, such as solar, wind, hydroelectric (that's iffy on cleanliness) or, ideally, nuclear power (at least until we get solar satellites microwave beaming power to Earth).
