(Milk makes total sense though. Baby animals drink milk and grow up fast, therefore, if humans drink milk they will grow up fast. The problem is we were lactose-intolerant for quite a while there.)

      Likewise. The quality of the advice dispensed would more than make up from the horrible back pain from squatting on a cat-sized barstool for hours. <br/>

Besides, even if the glasses are cat-sized too I imagine any bar that occasionally hosts Lyle probably serves up some serious "make you go temporarily blind" hooch regardless of the volume.

      Cornelius just seemed like the kind of guy who would see marriage as an equal companionship - it's a fight, but ultimatley, the participants are  <em>both</em>  winners.

      Except that Cornelius is the one who came up with the analogy.  He might agree with that assessment of how it should be, but he also knows the way things are.  He suffered a decided loss when his dear Iris Gambol passed, even though it would be hard to count that as a win for her.  He has had decades of living with the memory of the happiness he will never have again.  If they both won, that's a bittersweet victory, at best. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, Cornelius' dear Iris is always referred to as his first wife.  Clearly there was at least one more marriage that did not go as well.  Then there are titles of the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101006174958/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=03262002">dysfunctional children's books</a>  he wrote, which indicate some domestic troubles.  Maybe not with a wife at the time, but in the romantic arena. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On a tangent, very little has been revealed about Iris.  We have the wistful adoration of Cornelius, a bit about their time together from  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101006174958/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=06092006">the Badass Games</a> , and   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101006174958/https://corneliusbear.blogspot.com/2005/04/i-do-adore-that-lauren-graham.html">this blog entry</a>  from Cornelius that describes her appearance.  Maybe we'll get little flashbacks someday, like the ones of young Roast Beef.

      a fair and insightful analysis of Cornelius' views on marriage.  the two 'dysfunctional' books always struck me as slightly out-of-character for Connie, though.  definitely 'Oscar,' a bittersweet coming-to-terms with weight gain, but it is difficult for me to imagine that he ever had a drinking problem, or would think it proper to write a book about a relationship he didn't enjoy.  perhaps because his badassery is so complete now, is why i have trouble.

      As with most, I imagine his is a badassery gleaned through an extensive history of mistakes. In fact, the amount of time he's spent in prison would corroborate that I think.

      The world would be a much better place if more of us had someone like Mr.bear to talk to. Maybe the reason old people now think the world isn't as good as it was in the old days is because they aren't being like old people were in the old days.

      Oh my, how lovely and utterly poignant.  5's for the entire Beef-considering-proposal arc (10's, if I could manage it).  It's been a while since I had last read these, and they've only gotten better in the fullness of time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The thing that keeps coming back to my mind reading through these strips again is the alt text from way back, when Beef imagines marrying the stripper Madison (?), which was something like "The sadness is that there is something wrong with everyone."  This may as well be Beef's motto, it seems to me, but goddamn if this set of strips here doesn't perfectly capture the rationale by which any number of folks (myself somewhat recently included), wounded by the petty and profound emotional ravages of life, force themselves to recognize a good thing when they've got it and fucking hold on to it.  It's truly a wonderful thing that a comic artist can also create characters so deeply resonant and affective.  If I were less worried about coming off a pretentious blowjob, I might even carry on about how Beef's gradual epiphany, which is still always marked by a knowing sadness, reminds me of the way I felt reading Don DeLillo's 'White Noise'.  No small compliment, I guess is what I'm saying. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry for the Emotions, everyone.  Be gentle.
