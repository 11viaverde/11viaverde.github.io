      I can't really tell if you're joking or not, because I hear people say this all the time and I always wonder if we don't just live in completely different worlds. I mean it just seems like something most people would be certain about by the time they finish puberty unless they're super-repressed. And the latent aversion to homosexuality in our culture is strong enough that I think the average guy wouldn't be inclined to 'experiment' unless he were fairly dissatisfied with straightness already. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm just speaking from experience, but it's not like I'm particularly sheltered - I grew up in a pretty diverse metropolitan area, my politics are pretty extreme left, and my group of friends is far from being composed of frat guys or meatheads. Yet somehow I've encountered and interacted with very few gay people in my life and social circles, and among the people I know well, I honestly can't conceive of them engaging in even mild experimentation at any point. I'm not saying all this as a matter of pride or anything like that - I'm actually genuinely curious as to whether my experience is that far from that of everyone else's here and why this may be the case.

      It flat out hurts to agree with alreadyinuse, but I totally do.  There is a very strong sample bias depending on where you are asking, both geographically and in what social stratum the subject lies.  Further, the reliability of each sample is highly suspect, as most 'did it once when drunk' guys wouldn't respond as such.  I doubt the 1-2%, but I don't doubt that's what the survey came up with.

      Scrolling through my Facebook friends, I count 31 people out of 325 that I know for sure have had gay experiences. 17 dudes, 14 chicks, but I know that 4 of the dudes primarily identify as straight but have messed around with dudes once or twice. I didn't count chicks making out with chicks at parties, which would up the count significantly. That is my field research, I expect the Nobel prize folks will contact me within the week.

      No joke, this is a serious subject.  Nice report, thanks for the link.  I was thinking of the exclusively homosexual partners statistic, which is 1-2% in your report.  My concern is that things are kept in context and that people don't think everyone is doing something so why don't I do it too and get involved in things they wouldn't otherwise countenance.

      So, let me see if I understand what you're saying here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You have a concern that people will do gay stuff because they think everyone else is doing it? Correct me if I'm wrong, here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So then does that mean that if I'm basically straight, but I get it on with another lady because it's socially acceptable, that's somehow worse than me refraining from getting it on with another lady because it's socially unacceptable? Or is it more like you're concerned that I'll get it on with another lady because I think all the cool kids are doing it, and then regret it afterward because it was gay?

      I'd say the latter. There's a pretty good short story by Sartre about that kind of thing (Childhood of a Leader). I mean to the extent that it would enable people who would otherwise be repressed and unhappy to feel normal and accepted, it's totally awesome, but beyond that, there's really no point in trying to convince otherwise straight people that they are part gay or whatever.

      There's also no point, to my mind, that convincing some people that other people who you don't know aren't part gay, when your speculation doesn't bear fruit.  There are about a bizillion reasons that I can think of that you don't have any friends that you think have engaged in homosexual acts.  There are so many holes in this logic you could eat a steak through it.  Or drive a flock of seagulls through it.   <br/>

Also, Sartre was a pedogog.

      But that is a silly thing to think. It is silly. Obviously folks shouldn't be pressured into having any kind of sex, but there's no reason to regret gay sex any more than straight sex just because it's gay. Plus I think the majority of people who would have gay sex just because the cool kids were doing it are open enough to experimentation that it will not be a cause for "concern." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Trying to convince straight people that they are part gay" in the form of the Kinsey scale is not trying to convince them to perform gay sex acts. It's just saying that numbers indicate that homothoughts occur in pretty much everyone, so don't get down on the folks who are really into it. And even if you take away the prescriptive aspect of it, I still think it is worthwhile to present a numerical truth about homothoughts, because truth is good and valuable and stuff!

      Yes yes, but engaging in activities and having feelings are different things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have always seen Male Gayness reported as 3-4% of men being significantly or purely homosexual. A lesser percentage of women are mostly/totally gay. 2% is the figure I learned in Psychology (so it must be true!!!!!! <--- irony exclamation marks)  <br/> 
 <br/> 
This runs counter to the culture's lesbian fascination and subsequent drunk-girl-on-dancefloor-making-out-with-female-friends-to-get-attention 'fauxbian' phenomenon.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, the idea of Kinsey's scale is that very few people are 100% straight or 100% gay. For example, I generally identify as 5 or 5.5.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even if you never act on them, even if you are so horrified by them that you repress them  <em>so hard</em> , most people will have homosexual feelings during their life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some will not but they're kind of uncommon. Just as it is uncommon for a gay man not to have had a few moments where he was curious, aroused, or even attracted to a woman.

      Oh man, listening to voice mail messages is the worst. It's like the pre-recorded message lady enjoys drawing out your slow torture. "You have...12...new...voice messages. To listen to your messages...press 1. To delete your message...press 7, etc," and the instructions get repeated before every goddamn message. Meanwhile I'm just mashing 7 repeatedly because I don't even have the patience or the stomach to listen through month-old messages of "dude, where are you" or "hey, call me back" or "son why is there an incomplete on your transcript and why did we get a bill for 10 overdue library books?" JUST GO AWAY

      The worst is when someone says "I love you" at the end of a month-old message. GUHHH. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm sure you can understand my joy when I got cut-off from my pay-monthly plan (with free answer phone service!) and had to switch to pay-as-you-go with a distinct lack of guilt-laden accessories. So happy.

      I hate listening to messages because I just know there will be a two day old message from someone who needed to get in contact with me  <em>right then</em> .  <br/>

This happened once with some very bad news, and ever since then I have the beginnings of a panic attack when I listen to my messages.

      I used to see moths as the classy, subtle one Lepidoptera family, with butterflies being the loud, drunken sister-in-law who can't stop making jokes about being fat in high school; but MOTHS DRINK THE TEARS OF SLEEPING BIRDS has shown them for what they really are...vampires. That is nothing short of horrifying.

      Unfortunately, I think that the icon is one part of it (see if you can find any of miku224's posts - classic case of being pretty and everyone liking you no matter what you say, even though the dude was justifiably cool in and of himself without the crazy-good avatar), while the other part is that pictures always garner more chubbies than text does on these boards. <br/>

      Damn straight. They are what I hate most about Summer. I've been looking extra hard for a nice lady lately, not because I am in a romantic sort of mood, but because I like having the option of having another place to sleep if I come home and find a moth or five in my personal sleeping room. That is what I like best about having a girlfriend in the Summer. And no I'm really not kidding. This is probably why the last one broke up with me.

      Man, you people are afraid of  <em>moths</em> ?  Moths are like the most nonthreatening member of the insect community since ladybugs.  Talk to me when you're having nightmares of the giant, splintering head of a praying mantis steadily expanding until it is beyond all comprehension. <br/>

      I am astounded by the level of hate for moths.  I've always thought of them as occasional pieces of flying dirty butterfly that must be shooed away a few times a year.  There's been this moth in my living room for about a week that I let in when I was standing in the doorway smoking and watching basketball on teevee late at night.  I've come to think of him as a very cheap and quiet pet that is slowly dying.

      I was trapped in a contest of wills with a moth all day last Thursday.  He would flap near me, I would sort of take a little bit to notice and make a grab a second too late, and he'd fly away again.  This happened about once every twenty minutes.  After each occurence, I'd stare at him, lurking over by the TV, daring him to come back over here.  We'd see who ran this place then.  I didn't get much work done that day, but when I finally squished that damn moth it was  <em>so satisfying</em> .

      Once walking to school, something fell on my head, and I assumed it was a little bud from a tree or something, and when I went to brush it off it STUNG me and I realised it was a dying wasp. So, I had to go to the nurse's office and get it seen to, missed registration and the beginning of my first class, so they called home and asked why I hadn't arrived at school and my parents gave me a bollocking for skiving off, which I completely didn't do. <br/>

 <em>Fucking</em>  wasp.

      When I was in third grade my class had hermit crabs in our room and I was holding one in my hand. And I was looking at him all segmented and crawling around in my hand and it was cool, the way the mechanics of its body worked, so I brought my hand up closer to my face so I could see it better. Then it reached out and clamped onto my bottom lip and would. not. let go. I was crying and it hurt SO BAD and the crab wouldn't let go, and I ended up having to dunk my head in the water cooler.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I... I wish I had not thought about that. That's not a good memory. My feelings on this crab are: MegaCon.

      I'm imagining you flailing your arms, shaking your head, and flinging yourself chaotically about the room while the crap remains firmly fastened to your lower lip as you attempt to yell "get it off! get it off!" but can only a half-recognizable mumble. It's all very amusing.

Mid Hampshire Primary Care Trust constantly loans out items such as walking frames and sticks to assist people to move around and maintain their independence.

      "Jumping the shark" describes a point in a television series which marks the beginning of the end, and things can only get worse from then on.  It is a reference to the episode of "Happy Days" where Fonzie jumped over a shark on water skis in an attempt to revive the dying series.  Many people use it in other ccntexts to imply that an artist has reached his/her peak and has started to decline.  So when people say this thing about Onstad, they are saying that he doesn't have it anymore, and they garner many lames because they are wrong.

      I will not argue that fact, but take this quote from the above-linked article: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"[The term is used] to denote the point at which the characters or plot of a TV series veer into a ridiculous, out-of-the-ordinary storyline.." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I put it to you that boring and tired devices like tempting the soon-to-be-wed protagonist when he is of a character that is unused to being hit on by ladies is, in the context of Achewood, both ridiculous and out-of-the-ordinary.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As I said, I doubt this will begin the decline of Achewood, but it's not an interesting direction. <br/>

      But, if Achewood has shown a history of regularly venturing into the ridiculous and out-of-the-ordinary (dead-then-reborn characters, visiting the moon, heads of cartiledge, opening a subway), then wouldn't "jumping the shark" in Achewood be more along the lines of Dagwood and Blondie plotlines?

      I think it was just a literary device symbolizing that general quality that we all have that our partner does not and can not comprehend.  I don't think it is something to be taken literally as a defining aspect of Molly's character.  I think Onstad even plays loosely and ironically with these symbolic things.  As if he would have anything but a throw-away character in his strip who watches Dancing With The Stars.  As if.  Sheaaa...  Righttt.... <br/>

      I have heard it described as the best novel ever written.  I would recommend learning the language if only for this one novel.  I haven't read a translation, but I can't imagine how it could be translated faithfully.  I'm very fluent in French and I only knew 50% of the vocabulary in the book at the time I read it.  It makes use of a whole lot of the expressive capability of the French language... some of which simply doesn't exist in English, I think.  What can I say about it...  It is similar to Achewood in how trippy and surreal it is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
yeah.. if anyone wants they can feel free to lame you for my posts, but don't worry, I don't need any encouragement.  Sometimes I just talk to myself in an empty room even.  well later everyone.  I'm going to bed.  one more post before I go however.

      yeah like, take some of the most tripped out and fantastic and surreal Achewood strips.  Now imagine a solid prose novel of that, only more so.  cover to cover it is tripping.  Like some kinda LSD trip or something.  It almost creates it's own sort of code or language, and creates a world that runs by a different set of rules, one where sort of physical reality is imbued with and expressive of the emotions of the people who inhabit it, where inanimate objects are almost alive.  Some of the imagery and symbolism of The Matrix comes to mind, as far as the relationship with physical reality.

      99 percent of everything sucks. Most TV shows, movies, books, and most certainly people, suck. The odds of you not liking something that sucks are astronimical. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do not judge my friends for liking sucky things. I know I like some things that make people sigh and turn their heads. But not every meal will be filet mignon, and crappy bands/shows are the gas station cheeseburgers of media.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I'm trying to say is you don't need to be an elitest all the time. Do not let Coldplay be a dealbreaker for a hot chick for you.  <em>It is okay that she likes some bad music.</em> <br/>

Unless she only listens to bad music. Then she can go to hell.

      You probably miss out on a lot of good kisses.  Honestly, I'm very close to being a complete music snob, and it makes me sad to think that if I'd judged my girl based on music taste, I would have missed the best relationship of my life.  There are more important things.  It annoys me sometimes, but I can't imagine her without her silly Tina Turner, and her ridiculous 90s country albums...

      It's not so much about being an elitist as it is about being a narcissist. Basically I think I'm so awesome that, like spinynorman said, anything I like is by definition not lame. Aside from that, I generally overanalyze everything to such an extent that I can generally provide very specific reasons for how and why I like the things I like, which can generally be traced back to some basic principles, unlike the people who just say "i know it's silly but i just like it lol". So basically I'm so self-absorbed that I cannot bring myself to fully connect myself with someone unless they are exactly like me in every way, except they should have lady parts and not so much facial hair.

      I myself like chicks, physically, but I really dig gay guys on an emotional level.  It's hard for me to find a chick I'm compatible with on an interpersonal level, but I really dig gay guys on an interpersonal/emotional level.  I've taken it as far as having a crush on guys & making out with guys, but never really got past that if you're counting bases.  I just don't see that happening either.  I think too much TV and net porn has warped my gay mind into being straight.  Or maybe it was just ego-dystonic heterosexuality all along.

      I don't mean to be impolite but that was kind of sucky it was a guy talking in cliches and not very creative.  Don't get me wrong it was not a whole lot better or worse than much of what is posted here, but the difference is that it was non-interactive.  It was taking humor that we all have and packaging it up in a slick little production package and then ramming it at the general public with a massive marketing campaign.  Sort of like if dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately cleaned up his act to PG13 standards and then mounted a massive marketing campaign. <br/> 
 <br/> 
or wait maybe it was a viral marketing thing but either way as a viral marketing phenomen it would only be successful because of how much Microsoft and Television has lowered user expectations.  That is why dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately's posts will never become a viral marketing phenomen - because they aren't brainless mindless tripe that you see on TV.  If dr_manflesh_desires_anal_play_immediately's posts have no value, then TV is actively destructive and harmful, on the general spectrum. <br/>

that makes for an incredibly boring relationship. and i'm glad you admit to self-absorption and narcissism because those sorts of sentiments do in fact make you sound like a dick, even though i'm sure you're perfectly nice. i'm not saying you should necessarily be OK with it if your hypothetical girlfriend likes only things you think are shitty- of course not. but you realize that having such high standards for relatively trivial things like taste in music and television negatively impacts your chances of finding a meaningful relationship. and those things really are trivial. <br/> 
 <br/> 
if i've learned anything from high school and college it's that most of the time, people who like the same cultural stuff as you don't click with you at all. sometimes connections are in the last place you look.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i am confident in saying that i am pretty well-versed in music, film, art, literature etc etc, even if it makes me sound pompous, but i love watching vh1 reality television. i guess "i know it's silly i just like it lol." <br/> 
 <br/> 
sorry that was so long i just really object to that kind of attitude. i'm not sure how tongue-in-cheek you were being. either way, snowman has the right idea. <br/>

      I hope this doesn't sound snobby, but to answer your question eatmorekix, when enough of the country is dumb enough to elect someone like Bush, then, snobbery has got to be a part of your personality;  Every day of your life in your even mundane affairs you deal with a reality that is majorly influenced by idiots.  You may not dwell on it, but, a sense of relative snobism is still on some level a part of you.

      My understanding of snobbery comes from the fact that snobbery itself is relative.  Indie music snobs believe themselves snobby and knowledgeable, but people who have studied classical or jazz think indie kids know absolute shit about music.  They usually can't even explain the most basic parts of chord theory.  They just know who is cool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Same thing in painting, between collecting snobs and real pros.  Same thing in movies between "I only watch independent cinema" and people who have actually seen more than a thousand films.  Same thing even in food, between people who only eat food that costs a fortune and people who have traveled and studied. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The idea of 'most people's tast(sic) in things sucks' shows amateur snobbery.  It is nearly impossible to be a truly great snob in more than one field, as being a great snob requires real study.  Anyone who doesn't play an instrument at a professional level is an inferior snob to someone who does.  Basing a relationship around the degree of snobbery you have (it isn't about liking 'better' things, it's liking things you have similar level of understand of) is a great way of finding a shallow relationship.

      But that is the thing: most people don't take the time to actually understand the history of cinema  (for example) and appreciate what went into a movie, what it is referencing, how it was made what, movements it is a response to, etc. I try to at least acknowledge that there is a lot more to a movie than "I dunno I just like it", even if I don't know everything about film-making and film history.  <br/>

But sometimes I just toss all of this aside and like something because I am lazy and being so particular is tiring.

      Ahhh, if snobbery means "I like to at least analyze it at all and not just say it's cool because I'm an idiot" then I am totally with you.  Being snobbier than someone who refuses to think about what they view is totally okay, and I share it wholeheartedly.  If your relationship is based on love of actually thinking about art, then you probably have a good one. <br/>

On a related note, I think my tone above was more hostile that it needed to be.  I was airing my asshole on the internet, and that's not awesome.  Especially where I pointed out your typo.  That was stone cold-dick-in-the-eye uncool.  I hope we are still going steady.

      Although, I would like to point out that me and my boyfriend's relationship is not based entirely on snobbery (also also, maybe I should have used a different word than snobbery). I love him for a lot of other reasons also. Garg, why did I get into a lengthly internet discussion. I always feel like I am being unclear.

      I've found that the more I've learned about anything, the more prone I was to maintain a humble point of view. <br/> 
Each new experience reveals to you that there is infinite knowledge out there in the Universe, and it is ever-expanding.  To even think you can be an authority in any one thing (even a small, specialized thing) is to make a fool of yourself, and to ignore the infinity beyond your tiny realm of existence. <br/> 
Opinions are another thing alltogether, and can range from the ignorant ('All Republicans are money-grubbing assholes who hate minorities') to the slightly-more-well-informed ('my father is an asshole and a Republican').  But having an opinion does not necessarily make you snobby--thinking your opinion is the only correct one,  <em>does</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
PS - My father is a Republican, but he is not an asshole.

      union curves are the ultimate in voluptuous, but not in a smooth, perfectly airbrushed playboy pin-up way. they strain the darts on her uniform, breasts barely contained, fertile hips stretching tight the fabric across the lower belly. union curves can be found on older women who seduce younger men with cleavage, red lipstick and husky voices. union curves can be found on southern girls who didn't go to college and serve bacon to truck drivers. and of course, union curves can be found on flight attendants.

      That hurts. I dont know if you're just going for being funny, but I don't see how opposition to one thing would lead to that conclusion. I recognize the contextual role rosie the riveter and miller's poster played (which i fairly conflate from a historic sociological view), in that it was designed for a functional purpose and not for critique some 50  years in the future, but it bothers me that it's such a championed image when i can't help but interpret this subtext of "women must eschew feminine characteristics in order to be capable members of the workforce."  The verbal message i obviously agree with but the images (rockwell notwithstanding) seemed to delineate masculinity as a requirement rather than espouse the *capacity* for equality between genders. Although I will say there's nothing inherently wrong with the former, I do disagree. Were it Marie Curie in her laboratory, I'd have felt it more befitting apropos of empowerment.

      Oh no, I saw the original gladi8orrex comment. I was wondering where Edwell got the picture of a tie fighter for his strip. It's drawn in the style of Achewood, yet I don't remember there being a tie fighter in any of the strips, which means he must have drawn it himself.

      your avaton cals to mind Edward Gorey: <br/>

"They removed the child to the ballroom, whose hangings <br/> 
And mirrors were covered with a luminous slime; <br/> 
They leapt through the air with buzzings and twangings <br/> 
To work themselves up to a ritual crime. <br/> 
They stunned her, and stripped off her garments, and lastly <br/> 
They stuffed her inside a kind of a pod; <br/> 
And then it was that Millicent Frastley <br/> 
Was sacrificed to The Insect God."

      Interestingly enough, in Sloppy Stewardess Sluts 7, CP made his penis up to look like a plane.  It was a perfect circular reference.  All the 'actresses' had to do the pokey-pokey side-saddle for it, and he made WWII-era airplane strafing sounds during the moneyshot.  All in all one of his better works, though certainly no Ass-Puppet Basketball Team Banging Girlfriends 3.  That flick was all class.

      I hope he cheats.  Why?  Because somewhere, somehow he will have to be redeemed.  No one is perfect, not even Beef.  Everyone makes mistakes...even huge terrible ones.  Sometimes men are only as faithful as their options and with fame, Beefs options opened up. It would make him seem more real... sadly... then again... he is just a cartoon.  Therefor, he wont cheat.

      I need the moths card today.  There was a real big moth in my apartment building.  I mean it was as big as my hand.  I don't necessarily have big hands but a moth should not be that big.  A moth the size of my pinky fingernail is enough to set me on edge for a week.  And tomorrow we're getting a new couch, which means the doors will be open for a substantial portion of the day and the moth might go inside and go into hiding, and then wait until I'm playing video games late at night with the lights off, and then go all over the TV screen and I will freak and wet myself and it's not going to be a good time.  I'm not having a happy time right now. <br/>
