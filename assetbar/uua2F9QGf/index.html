      It wasn't like that at all.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
For hours she stared into the eyes of everyone who approached hoping they would introduce themselves as "Cornelius", that man who she elevated so highly, the man she can't get off her mind. She is plagued by confusion and loneliness but has managed to convince herself that he will show up for the concert. After a few hours, when people start leaving the concert hall, she finally comes to the realization that not only will Cornelius never come for her, but that no man will ever come for her. Her life becomes meaningless. The one thing she still loves in the world has slapped her across the face, so she leaves.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
She does not approach a bus with the intention of throwing herself underneath, she just finds herself in that position and realizes she has no reason to get our of the way. Stepping out of the path of the bus would be a deliberate move to continue living, which is something she can not bring herself to do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The bus driver realizes too late what is happening. The sound of screaming brakes is followed by an ominous thud, then another as her body falls onto the rain-drenched road. Her blood forms little eddies in a nearby puddle. Her thick eyelashes bat across dry, emotionless eyes whose last sight is of a dark, empty sky.

      Sure, that's really sad- but think of it from the road's point of view! <br/> 
 <br/> 
It felt the dull thump even through the endless amount of confusion and bustle that plagued it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The infinite drops forming streams and gullies along it grew colder. The old cobblestones had always felt for the rain, being composed of a similar sort of structure- hundreds of thousands of little pieces coming together to make something that, although very large and impressive in structure, was nearly perpetually dismissed as just a commonplace happening and no more. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The cars ran along it and ground their carefully designed tires along the rough surface. Each turn and creak changed the stone trail a bit- it felt itself eroding away year by year, and knew that the ubiquitous cars would be the end of the road for the road. Turning and squealing now disrupted the normal ebb and heave of the tides of human transportation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The sewers of Belgium rushed beneath it- pushing this way and that in the fecal tides running just below the crowded streets. The rain always the unfortunate side-effect of causing what was almost like indigestion for the road. Sloshing and churning, bubbling and crashing the sullied flow against the cramped old walls- if the road had been in the unfortunate position to have a gag reflex, there'd be shit-water everywhere. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But time slowed for the road, as it felt the old girl collide against its weather-weary stones. She lay, red life escaping through the fatal wound. It felt the many feet scurrying over to the scene. It felt the blood washing into the sever below to feed some forsaken fungus. But above all, it felt another tragedy join the long history it had seen as it slowly ground away. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Day by day. Month by month. Year by year.

      It's not even the fact that Rostropovich was an actual cellist. It's that Onstad chose a cellist who just died this year, which only adds to the pain and serves as yet another reminder that Cornelius' days are winding down fast. <br/>

Mr. Bear is probably my favorite character in Achewood, and I think it'd be pretty much impossible to knock him off his rocker, but if anything is going to do it this is probably it.

      note that the news item on the puppy is still developing.  the slide is so long, there was time to notice the puppy go down it, send a journalist to cover the topic, write the article, and publish it- the puppy is STILL going down the slide.
