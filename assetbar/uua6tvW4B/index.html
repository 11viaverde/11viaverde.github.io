      I think if that was the case you'd see Pat's reaction in the pink converse panel instead of in the next one. It would be fairly sloppy to delay a reaction during that much dialogue. Plus I don't think Pat would be too upset about them hitting a child, he'd probably blame the child for being near the road after dark.

      I'm inclined to think it isn't just the Heineken / wine thing, but that Pat isn't ever going to argue that someone is NOT dumb. To Pat everyone (but himself and the few famous people he likes) is dumb, and dumb people sicken him.

      You have to remember that Pat (alongside many,  <em>many</em>  other assholes) is on board with plenty of excellent concerns.  There are good economical and ecological reasons behind veganism (I don't happen to agree with them, but that's neither here nor there). It  <em>does</em>  suck that gays can't rent cars in Alabama. And having a conversation while driving (or otherwise dividing your attention) is proven to be one of the leading causes of car accidents. <br/> 
What I'm trying to say is that Pat is a dick.

      Yes, they can. The airport is pretty much the only damn place in Alabama where they have the titty mags anywhere but under several large piles of rock. As the point of entry, they're a little more cosmo than the rest of the state. <br/>

I exclude those extremely rural areas where there's so few people that the pretense of outrage has been dropped from the above statement, like where I went to college.

      This happened to me once, except that I got to be the driver, I didn't know where I was going, and "Ray" was the passenger who did, but wouldn't get off the cellphone. <br/>

He was telling a story on the phone about a time he was in the Army and he had sex on base with his (female) commanding officer. I kept asking which exit I take and then he said, "Wait, wait, wait... I CAME IN HER ASS!!!" <br/>

      What makes this strip for me is that while it could have ended with a snappy punchline in panel 3, or even in panel 5, it [i]didn't[/]. Which is what sets Achewood apart from the rest.

      I felt I had to revisit this strip to say: <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is wordy Achewood at its best. It is on the knife edge of being pretentious and bloated, but pulls it off. I think it's because Pat is the perfect foil for this conversation. Either way, a great strip.

      Wait - I think I've got it. The reason this works and, say, the more recent strips where Ray just sort of weirdly declaims about something is that Pat's presence and reactions make it clear that Ray is being dumb here. I much prefer the Ray who can banter with and tease Pat to the one who sits at his desk leaning back in his huge chair announcing his philosophy of life.

      Okay, someone needs to help me out here. Is it just me or is Pat nicer now? I mean. Yes, a dick be him, but he still seems to be a bit more stand-able. I mean maybe it's just that he has some back story now. Or that he's Gay and that relates him to a thing people I know are, well, a thing people I know are that isn't unpleasant (I KNOW WHAT I DID VEGANS!). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Actually, on second thought I think it's just he seems to be spending a lot more time with Ray. Less distant and all that, he's definitely no longer at the point of trying to shoot a man for a single insult. Also, I guess it aslo has to do with that people shouldn't talk on the phone while driving, f'reals.
