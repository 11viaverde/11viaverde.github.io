      ---'s third work in the famous 2008 "Blank Triptych" was controversial in it's use of positive, rather than negative space. The single, gaunt line proclaiming difference and absolution in the face of the post-modern morass of harassment and play. The frenetic scene of assetbar split open like a battle axe swooping through a young melon. -'s screenshot of his work was later purchased by donald trump for $80,000,000. Then he was eaten alive by wild gorillas.

      ATTENTION: If you're having trouble viewing this page, the culprit is not who you would think it is, but actually Dr. Manflesh. If your browser is barely scrolling, the easiest thing to do is go to another strip such as  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100112105750/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=10022007">this one</a>  and ignore him there.

      I'm sorry, but folks, if we have abided the good doctor's shenanigans this long, why should this be the time that our appreciation failed?  Is it because his comment directly affected us, rather than the supposed "other posters" that might be offended by his more "conventional" posts?  I say it is the height of hypocrisy to throw him to the wolves now. <br/>

      You know, this abortion of a post is a curiosity. There is a level in which it is impressive. He took the time to link every strip from 01 and 02. That takes dedication. However, the post is still shit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like a crap version of the famous "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte - 1884" by French Neo-Impressionist George-Pierre Seurat. You know the one, thousands of dots of color that when you step back, form an image of various social classes in a park in Paris. The painting is a stunning example of pointillism, and is considered by some to be the most remarkable paintings of the 19th century. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't care for this painting. It's nice, don't get me wrong, but get this. It took Seurat  <em>two years</em>  to paint his masterpiece. I look at it and think to myself " <em>jesus</em>  I would go blind twice painting just the border of this painting." What greatness could have been done in the time it took to paint just the grass in the picture. I find the laborious nature of the technique utterly distracting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mr. Quadruple Hyphen, you are the pointillism masterpiece that doesn't get better, no matter how far away to get.

      Giant, gleaming metallic vibrators roll across the blasted future landscape, crushing the charred remnants of civilization and as they search for survivors.  Overhead, flying robot drones broadcast high-density fan fiction directly into the minds of those unfortunate enough to be discovered.  The sheer amount of lurid, stilted prose causes the human brain to literally sever itself from the spinal cord.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
A ragtag band of freedom fighters, calling themselves the Ignorers, search what remains of the world for some way to end their nightmare.  Their hopes for success are but a dying ember in the charred wreck of the world, but still they search on.  They desire no more anal play forever.

Think of it as something like quantum indeterminacy - a theoretical construct that's useful in a particular field but gets taken out of context and dumbed down and distorted by the general public, who proceed to use it to caulk any gaps in their understanding of the world.

      I find comments like this obnoxious. I know philosophical people who work in restaurants and play in bands who are a HELL of a lot happier and healthier than people who work as engineers in offices, paying off college loans and buying little electronic gadgets to stave off the boredom of the meth-freals and maladjusted blobs that they spend their days with, under the strip lights amid the bone-rattle of keyboards.

      He didn't say he'd be an  <em>unhappy</em>  server!  I get where you're coming from, though.  My particular peeve is that it's immediately assumed you won't be able to have any job with a liberal arts degree. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A lot of companies are really just looking to hire people who have  <em>some</em>  degree, they don't care what it is, or where it's from.  If you want to work in an office, you can find a job doing it with any sort of degree.  That's the way it is for a lot of careers, outside of the specialized ones like: engineer, scientist, teacher, et cetera. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you want to work in advertising or sales, you don't need a degree in either of those things so much as you need a  <em>some degree, any degree</em> , a smile and a ribbon, and a really great interview.

      I'm neither personable, attractive, nor graceful enough to be a waiter. And I'd sooner drink a fire ant cocktail with my asshole than work in advertising or sales. The goal is to remain in academia indefinitely and be a professor, if I ever stop wasting time on here and catch up on all the work I'm behind on. Failing that, I can hopefully go back to journalism. So either way I'll be making less than a waiter. However, I will be able to look at my words in print, which, if you haven't figured it out yet, pleases me immensely.

      read the book _word play_ by Alex Frankel, Alex.  As described in that book, there is actually an area of marketing in which you can be successful by applying basically academic talent and creativity.  Before I read that book I thought advertising was something that couldn't possible interest me.  Now I see that in fact an intellectual understanding of language is central to some areas of marketing/advertising, and from reading this book I see language in a different way as well. <br/>

      Digs against the value of abstract education are nothing  more than efforts to disempower and disenfranchise the citizenry.  Obtaining a liberal education is crucial for the maintenance of democracy.    The establishment wants you to believe that we all need to be engineers or technicians.  It wants this because technicians are easy to control and manipulate.

      It was supposed to be a joke? You know, ha ha? <br/>

I'm sure you can get a job with that degree. You can also get a job with no degree. I have a friend who went to Stanford on a full ride and now does part time guitar lessons with a math degree. And I know people with no college who make hella money helping old people invest their money. I'm not one dead set on upper education as a be all end all source of happiness, let alone one that is telling you to get specific kinds. <br/>

      Oh.  I didn't catch that it was said in jest.  Sorry.  I just got back from three weeks of visiting family and old friends - mostly engineers who epitomize the disempowered geek type to a T - so it's possible that I'm oversensitive to the issue right now. I had lunch with two semi-employed engineers who had both either recently declared, or were about to declare bankruptcy on account of health care costs.  We spent the day discussing single-payer health care and they were firmly against it.  I was merely trying to offer support for the proposition that education has value apart from its ability to get you a slightly better job with a soul-crushing corporate overlord.

      Well, I didn't answer you only 'cause I thought some other good samaritan would happen by to do it for me. I was wrong. So here - it's a famous Pixies lyric somehow loosely concerning a famous Bunuel film. If you're inclined to find out more about one or the other, let me opine that, at the end of the day,  <em>Doolittle</em>  is far more worthwhile and entertaining than  <em>Un Chien Andalou.</em>

      Yes, I replied to the top comment so my comment can be seen, I'll admit it. However, I just wanted to make sure everyone knows that The Great Outdoor Fight hardbound book changed my life and I have now dropped out of law school and started training every single minute for my chance to rule at life. I know commenting like this is a douche thing to do and I apologize in advance to all who would like to chastise me for my douchiness (or dooshiness as someone below commented) and would like to end with a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson. "My name is Ralph Waldo Emerson, but you can call me Ral..."  <br/>

      Not to sound like a prick, but do you only look at Achewood through Assetbar, achilleselbow?  Onstad has had numerous comments at the top of the "main" page for months now talking about the extra things that will go into the book. <br/>

      I made the mistake of installing Firefox 3.0.1, and I am suffering through all manner of bugs and inconveniences because of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One thing is does do correctly is automatically display long titles, so I can see the caption thingies without installing a plug-in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What it still doesn't do correctly is show the whole picture when Assetbar puts a scroll bar under a picture, as the one above. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Does anyone know of any plug-in or tool that will show the far right couple of inches of an overly wide picture?  Or is it not a Firefox thing but an Assetbar thing?  Or am I just an inept mouser? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thanks for any help I get.

      I tried to reinstall FF2, and it crashed so hard I had to use IE to access the fooking mozilla website. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, FF2 gave me the same missing-the-right-edge-of-images crap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And when I right-click, I don't get the option to open the image in a new tab, I just get "View Image," which is fine, except by opening the image in the same tab, it resets all the yellow posts, and makes it harder to find the new posts.  This is not so bad when there are only 2 or 3 hundred, but when it gets up to 6 or 8 hundred, it makes Jesus cry.

      Geeze, there were actual musicians and girls in Beef's school who didn't spend so much time and money on their hair. At least we know where he got the mad skills he used when he did his hair in the Volvo of Despair. I always thought they came with curse. PS -- so Beef and Ray are about 32. I thought younger, like 28.

      I may share the same graduating year, but I probably wouldn't have hung out with Beef in high school. <br/> 
     Oh sure, we might have talked after a particularly interesting creative writing class, where he was really impressed with the passionate rage in the piece I wrote (which, incidentally, I wrote as a joke--just a long rant about something I saw on TV, to piss off my teacher).   <br/> 
     And we might have had mutual friends who bridged the not-quite-smart-enough -to-be-a-nerd- but-not-socially-developed-enough -to-be-noticed group and the "emotion hair" standoffs that smoked close to the back door, smoked so  <strong>furiously</strong>  at the 2nd-shift janitor, just  <em>daring</em>  him to say something, so they could reveal what they knew about the freshman panty-shot shrine that he kept in his small locker in the auto shop. <br/> 
     But we wouldn't have been friends, per se.  We wouldn't have had that much to talk about, and we would have been simultaneously embarrassed at our failure to connect with another soul that had felt so many similar things. <br/> 
    Not even music-- listened to what a lot of my friends listened to.  And I didn't bring too much to the table besides Weird Al, Monty Python, Dr. Demento clips, and the Christian rock that I thought was "pretty hard stuff".  I felt decadent listening to 'Kiss off', like I should say 'sorry' to God each time I heard it and enjoyed it. <br/> 
     We wouldn't have been friends, but I think that if we ran into each other at the 10-year reunion, the names would spring to the front of our minds immediately, and we would instantly brighten our eyes: "aww yeah!  I remember hanging with you at Greg's house that time we filmed that crappy Civil War re-enactment, and you totally wouldn't change out of that sweater with the leather stripe through it, even though it was totally not era-appropriate!  How've you BEEN, man?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
     But, then again, I was pretty vanilla.  All 6'4", about a buck-sixty, sporting a non-bowl near-pageboy that got me confused with the ass from the Encyclopaedia Britannica TV commercials.  Some of my senior pictures featured me on a Harley... <br/> 
 <br/> 
     ...but I hadn't earned it.

Outside with the tree.  Awkward kneeling next to the tree.  Touching the tree with one hand, both hands.  Trying to lean away from the tree while holding onto it or a low branch above it.   <br/>

      Well the Dead Kennedys are mentioned in his high school zine....and the dead kennedys rule...so  I will assume that he didn't grow out of them at that time. Still that mixtape is pretty much what I imagine Roast Beef would put on a mixtape. It's the kind of stuff Molly put on her youtube tape for him.

      Hmmm, in my first last year of High School I had the single portait taken that we could use on I.D. that was free if you bought the class pic. Those students not having the "nice" portrait done went through first and we where sat down and hap our phot taken and then moved on. So my I.D. had me looking surprised because my photo was taken as I was falling of the posing stool.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
For my second last year of high School (don't do drugs until you  <em>start</em>  university kids) I decided to forgo the portrait and class pic (it was a different school, my old one wouldn't let me back, though to be fair when they asked why I wanted to return I said I knew where the toilets where already). I was at this new school 'cause I had fucked up at the last one so while all the other students had special purple class jumpers I had only bought the minimum school uniform, white shirt and grey shorts from the school's second hand uniform shop. My best mate, who was also repeating his last year at the same new school had bought the same minimal uniform (although to be fair he had quit and got a job halfway though the previous year rather than just being a truant pot smoker like me). The night before the photos we were looking at old class pics from our previous school. He and I both admired a pic of a very cool schoolmate of ours who also sold us drugs. He had a a very cocky pose that incorporated a thrust forward jaw and a slight turn to the side. We both decided to try this pose in the class photo although niether of us told the other. When the photos came back we where there in out stark white shirts in a sea of purple. Both of us sticking our jaws up and to the side (too far, we looked ridiculous), looking like we had been hiding untill the photo was taken and then  <em>SPRANG</em>  up like masai warriors. It was generally accepted that we had ruined the class photo on purpose. No one believed us when we said we were just trying to look cool.

I asked my mother, but she was currently fishing a hotpocket out of the toilet, and she is not to be bothered when she does that, if I wish to eat.

      I remember buying some opium scented incense in college, assuming it was just a name that was put on the packet to make it sound cool. Then one of my mates came into my room and went "Dude, why does your room smell of opium?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I replied "To cover up the smell of weed?"

      drugs are awesome fun.  drugs can have side effects however.  You can shop at the balck market, you can shop at the white drug farmacy, you can shop at the helfud store.  I would say that drugs are only one tool to use on the path to self-enlightenment.  General education and self-awareness is another good thing to go after.  good luck!

      Achilleselbow's position on drugs: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically anyone who makes drugs their Thing is an extremely lame and worthless individual. This includes the pothead who won't shut up about Pink Floyd and what movies are great to watch when high, the drunkard who constantly feels the need to tell you what stupid shit he did or where he vomited last night, and the acid-head who prattles on about how eating a plant will expand your mind and make you see the face of God. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Aside from that, occasional casual use of drugs is no big deal and often enjoyable. A well-made Brandy Alexander is both delicious and a good conversation piece. A joint or pipe passed around at a party or while watching a movie with friends can make the situation that much more hilarious. And though it won't make you reach nirvana, a quiet day spent in a controlled environment after eating an acid tab or consuming quality shrooms (perhaps ground up and mixed into a cup of tea) can leave you with some intellectually and aesthetically interesting new impressions. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are also drugs like heroin and coke that are actually addictive and fairly damaging to your body, and, seeing how they don't leave you with any lasting impression beyond a temporary physical pleasure that you will feel the urge to seek again, are not worth trying at all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hope that helps.

      Nah, the best Office Space song is the one by Scarface <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Now the funeral is over and all the tears are dried up<br/>
Niggas hangin deep on the cut gettin fired up<br/>
Lookin for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie<br/>
An eye for an eye, so now your life is what you owe me<br/>
Look deep into the eyes of your muthafuckin killer<br/>
I want you to witness your muthafuckin murder, nigga<br/>
And since you wants to kill, then your ass has got to fry<br/>
But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die<br/>
We play the game for keeps and if you slept I guess you sleep<br/>
You sho nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep<br/>
Cause where I come from, yo, everybody's got a gat<br/>
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at<br/>
And if your shit is flimsy, then your ass is gonna bend<br/>
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end<br/>
I'm rollin through your hood, now my heart is filled with anger<br/>
You at your sister's house and now your sister's life in danger<br/>
(By a total stranger) with the ?kanga?<br/>
Niggas wanna bang ya and hang ya<br/>
Sting ya with one up in the chamber<br/>
Let's take a trip up Holloway<br/>
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today<br/>
We standin up for our own shit<br/>
And if you outside the click, then you die, bitch<br/>
It ain't no love in this muthafucka<br/>
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother<br/>
Because we real with this shit, so we stay true<br/>
And since we bang, we do what O.G.'s say do<br/>
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror<br/>
So I'm lookin at me vaguely<br/>
But I can't seem to fade me<br/>
I've got my pistol pon cock<br/>
Ready to lick shots non-stop<br/>
Until I see your monkey-ass drop<br/>
And let your homies know who done it<br/>
Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit <br/>
you muthafuckas know who run it<br/>
So when you put this muthafucka to the test<br/>
You gotta realize somethin, nigga: (you fuckin with the very best)<br/>
I've got this killer up inside of me<br/>
I can't talk to my mother, so I talk to my diary<br/>
I'm goin off on the deep end<br/>
I find myself face to face with myself while I'm sleepin<br/>
I see your picture in my head and my hand shake<br/>
You can run, you can hide, but there's no escape<br/>
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy<br/>
I got to get this muthafucka before he gets to me<br/>
So in your own blood you'll bathe<br/>
And I won't stop until I put this muthafucka in his fuckin grave<br/>
And I can say this once again<br/>
You can cry but you'll still die, there'll be no tears in the end</em> <br/>

      I saw a portrait taken of me in high school last month.  Sure didn't look like me.  I thought it was just a stock photo in the picture frame purchased from Walgreen's.  It turns out the pictures that my mother has hung over her fireplace for a decade are in fact me and my little brothers.  We had hair then.  I wonder if she's secretly ashamed that she gave birth to three totally bald dudes.

      I wrote a little aside about a day in the life for Roast Beef back when he was in high school, but I ended up pressing Backspace when the browser wasn't focused on the comment posting box. So it's all gone now.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry.

      In my senior yearbook, there's this picture of me sitting in a chair on stage, legs played, cupping my balls.  I'm not sure when this happened, or exactly in what context it took place.  I am extremely angry at the person who did the layout on that page, as I'm sure this was a personal attack on me.  Come to think of it, why did someone even take that picture?

Not really.  I don't know you.  But if it's any consolation, my friend went into a trashcan (one of the lidded ones) and hid until our other friend came so that he could scare him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So at least you didn't, like, smell.

Awesome.  On par with the book report I gave in front of my 3rd grade class.  Halfway through the report, I had to leave suddenly, to run to the bathroom.  Walking back into that classroom, and finishing that report...  That's life, there.

I gotta say, if you continue posting these shame spirals on YouTube, the  <strong>least</strong>  of your worries is going to be classmate rejection... <br/>

P.S. - Move somewhere away from the eternal tornado that appears to sit next to your school...

      Ray has taken on Beef's vocal mannerisms lately.  I think it started with his wedding speech.
