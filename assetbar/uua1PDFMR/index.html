      I considered it, but Omni brings value (when not dumping this shit on us). And I just love them dancing kitties!  <br/>

      "ouch" as in: <br/>

- being floated as one who may need to be ignored in the way alreadyinuse/etc. is ignored <br/> 
- "brings value often enough," which I read as "maybe not usually" <br/>

      For the record, you have your moments (don't we all?). But you are no alreadyinuse! <br/>

Let's try it again: I say "brings value often enough", you hear "at least as interesing as I hope to someday be."

      Just to set the record straight - comparing omni  <em>in any way</em>  to lateadopter is like comparing Fall Out Boy  <em>in any way</em>  to Fugazi - it's just silly silliness. One just got here and started spoutin' bullshit, all "troll-lite," and shit and one's been here since old times and has solidly and intelligently contributed to this place. <br/>

      I stand by what I said, if not by what you made it mean. Re-read, rowboat, and tell me what exactly you'd like retracted: That lateadopter brings value often enough that I don't want to miss it? That I loved the bit that everyone lamed out of existence? That bits like it are exactly what the comment section is for? Or maybe you'd like me to retract hoping someday to be at least as interesting as lateadopter? Omni brings value, but I have to heavily qualify it with "when not dumping this shit on us." Never had to say that about your old friend lateadopter. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Could I have said it better? Of course. I am a witless hack. But I stand by what I said.

      How do you know it was not the pain of your leaving that left her sitting alone in her room with only the lamp from the bedside table on the side you used to sleep giving her just enough light to see the cesspool of her life, blinding her into a period of suffocating introspection from which she eventually emerged still dripping with the dregs of the bodily fluids you left on her, she goes to the top floor of the tallest building around and looks out the window and down on the city and opens it and steps outside and both feet are sticking out off the edge and her breathing stops and she walks back but before she went she says "Yes, I never want to have to miss this feeling" and soon she is on the ground in her room again it is dusk and there are red bags under her eyes and her knuckles are broken from clutching a pencil and she dons a suit looks at herself from all angles side to side  <em>I did it</em>  and she never forgot your name, never once lied to herself, it didn't even occur to her to tell herself it was for any reason other than you so that when she was in that corner office with the fake plant in the corner and the computer running Windows XP on the mahogany desk and she saw your name on the caller ID she knew, she smiled, she lifted the receiver. And she put it back down.

      I wouldn't say her personality changed, but I never got to know who she really was.  Which just means it's best that I left.  If, over the course of six months, she is unwilling or unable to reveal any hint of the interesting person she could be, then I was probably never going to get to see who she was inside.    <br/> 
 <br/> 
And falseprophet may be partly right, in that getting dumped was a kick in the pants for her; but I don't think she smiled at the thought of me or that it ever would have crossed her mind to thank me for any of her successes thereafter.

      To me, the answer is easy.  You want a partner who is not just along for the ride.  You want a partner who has ideas of their own and is, if not your equal, then damn close.  While you can love anyone from any walk of life, it is much easier to LIVE with someone who is in the same walk of life as you.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sure, you can tell me about the hollywood meme that you cannot help who you love, but I found a nice balance where I have both love and a practical living situation in my life. I got the best of both worlds.  It is better than a hollywood ending where they hold hands in the sunset and then fight like cats and dogs when the camera turns off.

      Au contraire!  I mean, I do want to do Mike Lowell, but the others I just like to watch play baseball.  The Orioles bullpen has been tragic since the All-Star break and sometimes the defense is a bit - porous.  Boston's got a nice payroll, yeah, but they've also developed some impressive talent.

      I understand that the Sox are impressive. Evil comes in many forms.  <br/>

But ultimately, yeah - I can't imagine what it would be like to have to act enthusiastic for the O's season in and season out. I understand looking elsewhere for inspiration. But at least look outside your own division! That's just cruel. The Nats, for example. They're sure to lift your spirits.

      I was an Orioles fan until I moved from Maryland to the Boston area. It was easy for me to translate my fandom to the Red Sox because all the players I liked from the mid-90s Orioles left/retired, shortly after that 1996 Yankees/Orioles series when the fucking kid reached into the outfield and grabbed the "home run" ball from the outfielder.  <br/>

      Wow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, Penis, you bring up interesting and generally useless questions. You bring them up in a cogent, concise manner that shows a modicum of thought and expresses an honest intent to further human knowledge and awareness. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And you bring it up in the comment section of a comic strip where our main cat Ray may have just started down the path to matrimony blazed by his first mate Beef. Failing to see any connection or contextual application.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is it somehow (if loosely) connected to Tina having an MBA, so now she is qualified to work a sex line?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or did it occur to anyone else that she may have specifically taken a job on the callipygian cake-sitters line knowing that sooner or later... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I'm certain that any anecdotal information gathered here will be of no real use to furthering human knowledge of (or interest in) rape fantasies. I further suspect that there exists any number of professional, collegial or adult-oriented sites where raising these questions makes a lot more sense than here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, this is not the channel I tuned into. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(But since you ask, it may have something to do with quilt. People get really weird around the way sex can be sublime and degrading all at the same time. Both men and women may fantasize about raping and being raped while masturbating as a way of diverting guilt. On the one hand, it is being done to you, and is out of your control = no guilt. On the other hand, masturbating is so much less "sinful" than raping someone = no guilt about the masturbation. Yeah, I know, it's a bit over-simplified, but this is a comment section of a comic strip.)

      I don't know if I'd necessarily call Gurochan "worse" than the others.  For various reasons it's strictly limited to drawings, photographs are not allowed there. <br/> <br/> <br/> BTW penis (if I may call you that), you also missed the possibility of guys who fantasize about being raped, whether in the face or the hand.  I'm sure there's some Freudian explanation why they subconsciously want to experience it, but I couldn't say what it is.

      Cognition is the ability to think.  You can choose to use it or not.  Americans aren't predisposed to dumbness.  Students just don't care about their subjects. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, it is true that US professionals are just as good at their jobs as professionals from other countries.  That was because they chose to learn that specified knowledge well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The government doesn't put much focus on education, because, I think, they feel that it isn't a priority since we are already on top.  Which is a foolish thing to think. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kids are naturally apathetic.  But if someone pushes them a lot, then they work harder.  This society doesn't push a lot. <br/> 
What country are you from, if I may ask?

Whether America is close to the top or not is a matter of opinion.  To you, we would be if we had free health care, etc.  But that may mean higher taxes, and even if you only tax the rich high amounts, they are going to say that the country doesn't respect the your right to keep what you earn.

      Omni, I'm not sure what kind of "professionals" you're talking about - saying that U.S. has to "import" foreign workers because of American incompetence is beguiling to say the least.  Most of my non-American engineer friends came here for better opportunities in both graduate study and industry.

      Godammit, y'all makin' me pull out the  <em>statistics</em> : <br/> 
 <br/> 
The US is #1 in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://www.nationmaster.com/graph/edu_ave_yea_of_sch_of_adu-education-average-years-schooling-adults">Average hours of education</a> , #2 in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://www.nationmaster.com/graph/edu_edu_att_sen_sec-education-educational-attainment-senior-secondary">number of adults educated to the tertiary level</a> , #4 in  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://www.nationmaster.com/graph/edu_spe_per_pri_sch_stu-spending-per-primary-school-student">spending per student</a> , and the US has 31 of the top 100 universities.  I'm not saying this is the end-all-be-all of the discussion, but frankly I see a lot of discussion being pulled out of the proverbial ass.  If your going to make a claim as wild as to say that the US is less intelligent than most of the rest of the  <strong>world</strong> , let alone the rest of the first world, you are going to need something better than  <em>hurdy-hudry-hur roundabouts hurdy I-heard-this-somewheres hurdy</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, you could argue that we are less educated than much of the first world, but 1) I doubt there would be a stark difference, 2) education isn't exactly correlative with intelligence, and 3) ... there is no 3.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
P.S.  To think that out/in-sourcing has anything to with intellectual intelligence as opposed to vocational intelligence is bit strange.  You don't have to be well educated to be, say, a lab technician or low level computer programmer, and in many cases this is the case.   <em>That's</em>  a question of employment cost, not education.

      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_the_United_States">Wiki </a>  has more info on this. First of all, the 97% data relies partly on self-reporting and response to written surveys (which poses an obvious problem). Secondly, the main criterion is grade completion - it's assumed that kids who have passed third grade know how to read. Of course in practice this is not the case - kids get pushed through after being left back several times because their parents get pissed, or the school just doesn't want to keep spending money on them. Even if they do technically know the sounds that each letter makes, or even if they know a few hundred words, a large percentage of people are "functionally illiterate" in that they are unable to comprehend simple sentences, much less make sense of the kinds of information they need to function in the adult world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate]comparison[/rurl  you're all referencing, it's no surprise that countries like Georgia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and other former Soviet republics are all near the top. For all the faults of our system, education was always the #1 priority: it was not only compulsory, but completely free up to and including postgraduate level, and its quality was top-notch. By the end of first grade, I had learned fractions and multiplication and memorized several Pushkin poems; here, multiplication wasn't even mentioned until third grade and people were still sounding out each syllable when they read.

I always get jealous of people who learn so much so early, but then I realize that the reason I didn't learn how to read when I was 3 and learn physics in fifth grade or whatever was because no one tried to teach me it.  I think kids are smarter than educators give them credit for. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I learned what a verb was every year between first and eight grade.  Yes, a lot of kids forget.  Those kids deserve to fail out for not trying harder to remember.

      If you can't remember what a verb is by the end of grade 1, you should repeat grade 1 until you can (or at least, grade 1 English).  Seperating students by ability makes a lot more sense than by age.

      It only makes sense if your aims are scholastic and not social engineering.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In me grandpappy's day, you were required to go to school until you graduated the eighth grade or turned eighteen, whichever came first. He wanted out, so he moved up the grades quickly. This back-fired, since his dad was so proud he made him go to high school. He still graduated when he was seventeen, and got out a full six months sooner than many of those who had shared the eighth grade with him. <br/>

Anyway, back then it was about lernin', not socializin'. <br/>

      Well the point was about grammar, since gethen doubted that someone with an MBA would make grammatical mistakes in speech. I also don't think he's particularly dumb compared to the average individual, but he certainly falls short of the intelligence one should expect in a president.

      This is true, sometimes people who do well in school really aren't that smart (AP Psych class in mind) and the smarter people do only okay (myself).  However, I do think that you have to be at least of normal intelligence in order to get into Harvard.  I don't think someone with an IQ of 80(which people seem to characterize GW as)(assuming IQ tests are accurate) would be able to even get in. <br/>

      I'm with you there, GW is no 'idiot', and to write him off as such is to simplify what should be a complicated argument.  If you're attempting serious political discord, the "BUSH IS DUMB" approach should be in the same strawpile as "____ IS LIKE HITLER" or "____ IS AN ADULTERER". <br/>

      Actually, I think it's a pretty common problem. I remember our English dept. had some article posted in the office about a whole emerging field of teaching businesses effective communication, as in writing emails and memos in such a way as to be syntactically clear and actually have the recipient understand whatever message you're trying to get across. You would not believe some of the sample emails that were quoted - far worse than anything I've seen on YouTube comments.

      Now calm down little guy, okay?  Your Uncle Ray and Aunt Tina are very good friends, but we're not getting married.  I think it's time I explained this to you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is what adults call a "Strategic Marketing Merger".  That's when two big people, who like each other very much, want to consummate a union of two economically and demographically diversified marketing strategies, in order to produce a more stratified global economical offspring. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's why you saw Aunt Tina giving Uncle Ray the "special business handshake" in the backseat of the 'Sclade--it's part of the business model. <br/> <br/> <br/> ...I just totally barebacked that explanation of "The Birds and the Biz"...

      Except that "say" is a typical English dypthong ("AY-ee"), while "c'est" is classic French pure monothong ("EH"). Your French teacher must've been a Brit. <br/>

      I like it when I read the strips early after their posting, such that I can read the strip and all the comments and then proceed to get back to work satisfied.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I must say that this strip gets to me. I am rather like Ray: a well-dressed party  <em>animal</em>  with a keen eye for opportunity, yes; but we connect in a much more meaningful way-- our relationships with women.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sure, my busy days and nights full of drunken romps are prone to my share of womanizing, but dammit, do I ever want to settle down with someone. I too, have my eyes on a career woman. Her ambitions turn me on ever so much. Inasmuch as every time I go on a date with her, I just want to start a business and put her in charge of advertising. My ego melts for her like a popsicle in the sun.

      What is all the dogging on Tina?  I think she's alright, she's got a little more spunk and character then Molly, I appreciate that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Molly's cute and all, but let's face it, she's just sort of the pixie, striped socks type that every guy with depression wishes he could have as a foil.  A real Amelie.  Sort of Yawnsville to me, I mean, let me guess, she's going to be really sweet all the time and forgive any stupid misgivings.  Tina has enough of a tinge of skeeziness that will make her interesting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd prefer Ray and Tina focus over Beef and Molly.  As a matter of fact, we could go a couple weeks now without Beef or Molly and I'd be pretty much alright.

      You crazy kids and your wine-whine merger. <br/>

It bothered me so much, back in elementary school, when we'd be presented with a story with blanks in it, which we had to fill in given the clue of a drawing of a homophonic word (like a bee taking the spot of the word "be"), and for the intended word "which," there would be a drawing of an old warty crone with a pointy hat, and I'd complain to the teacher that the exercise was inaccurate because (for me, and for a remaining tenth of Americans) there's a phonemic distinction between the voiced and the voiceless labio-velar approximant, and she'd just sigh and tell me that if I liked words so much, why didn't I  <em>marry one</em> ?

      You know I had a teacher just like that in 5th grade. She would make us stand up to talk to her and there was this short kid she always made fun of. I used to see him crying in the lunchroom over a ham sandwich.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I felt sorry for him, but I didn't associate with him because I was a bit of a prick in elementary school. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I invited that teacher to come to an awards ceremony for me back in high school and she sent me a letter saying she didn't care if I had a 4.0 GPA and she drew a big middle finger at the bottom of the page. The Post Script included ramblings to the extent of how I got her address and why I thought she cared. <br/>

I've since managed to sign her up for some porn mags.

      I think that when she hired she was in stable mental conditions. Later on when she wasn't so sane, the principal was probably too afraid to fire her. <br/>

      i had a teacher in 9th grade. i was a good kid. cool. and i was smart and the teachers liked me. so i'd get called up to write something on the board frequently. i always cordially obliged. <br/>

well, i was wearing bermuda shorts (as was the SoCal style in the mid-80's). and there was a new girl in the class. long blond hair and big tits. i had a raging hardon. and the teacher called me up to the board. <br/> 
 <br/> 
i declined. she re-requested my presence at the front of the class. i re-declined and she became perturbed and insisted i come up. i did not.  <br/>

i don't remember how the rest of it went. but i do remember her not giving me any credit or just trusting me that i was not interested in coming up.  <br/>

      "Assetbar" is an odd name, now that you mention it.  I guess Onstad thought of each strip as an "asset," and this is a "bar" or "pub" or "place to discuss assets."  (The military speak of assets in terms of people and equipment deployed.  Then there are financial assets.  Not to forget female assets.)

      OK. Got it. Gore didn't invent the Internet (which has the nice alliteration of a catchy slogan), he "took the initiative in creating the Internet" (which has the distinct wooden tone that explains why he isn't likely to ever be president.) OK. Thank you for clearing that up. Because creating and inventing are such very different things. Good luck un-ringing that bell!

      You know, I can agree with that up to a point, but unfortunately, people have been needing to say this for about 90% of strips in recent memory. I think the main difference is that whereas older strips actually had funny or absurd situations in addition to Onstad's distinctive writing style, the recent ones focus exclusively on dialogue combined with mundane and everyday situations, basically just rehashing Beef and Ray's respective talking styles to the point that I think it's becoming grating and formulaic. Like for Beef it's 'let's see how many random unrelated analogies I can stick in to make this boring marital argument appear more interesting'. I don't think it's particularly witty either. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is just my attempt at describing why I've been enjoying it less lately. Clearly I've enjoyed Achewood in the past, probably no less than most of you, and if you look at the favorite strips in my profile, you'll probably see some sort of pattern.

      Achewood is a novelistic comic.  It has classic characteristics of the graphic genre, but allows for divigations of character and mood. <br/>

      I was just rereading some of the comments on the "Million Story Building"/Chris Ware homage strips.  Man, there were a bunch of crybabies on that one, people posting misguided goodbyes to a comic strip, heralding it as some kind of threshold into mediocrity, etc.."achewood will never be the same after this."   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I always go back and reread the strips after a few months or so, and lay off any decision until then.  I remember hating the Lonis Edison arc while it was happening, but now it might be my favorite. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But my overall gut feeling is that achewood hasn't been as good for about 1.5 years, but that time frame mysteriously matches up with the existence of assetbar.  Might be all the over-analyzing, or maybe the analysis is correct...

      The only way to make the name Gene work is to render it in the form "Gene, Gene, the dancing machine," but instead of dancing, substitute in an appropriate skill.  Gene becomes desirable as a baby name/basketball teammate/marriage partner by substituting in dribbling/dribbling/cunnilingus.

      But we are supposedly here to discuss the comic after all. And you seem to be under the impression that intelligence and humor are mutually exclusive. I would say that the earlier strips were actually  <em>more</em>  intelligent in their use of surreal juxtaposition and absurdity, or even just the cleverness of the punchlines. Just because you involve a character in a story arc that's not especially funny, that doesn't automatically make it "character development". <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are too many awful webcomics who use "character development" as an excuse to never write anything funny or original. Instead, they simply involve their characters in banal, drawn-out storylines, usually involving relationships, as a method of keeping you coming back just to find out what happens next to so-and-so. I say fuck that shit. I have a right to expect a webcomic to be funny, especially one that used to make me laugh uncontrollably on a regular basis, just as you have a right to disagree. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As much as people want to make claims to Achewood being on par with high literature or whatnot, it is still a webcomic - an especially good webcomic, but a webcomic nonetheless, and as such, it is subject to the limitations of the medium. I don't mean the actual comic format - after all, Alan Moore's work ranks among the best literature of the 20th century. I'm talking about the fact that it's a regularly running strip, which means that Onstad has to come up with something to post four days a week whether he has good ideas or not. It's an economic and conventional imposition on the art that dilutes both form and content. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If he actually wanted to write some unified, compelling narrative, which I'm sure he has the ability to do, he'd have to sit down and plan it out and have an idea of where it's going rather than making it up as he goes along without being able to change anything. Clearly he did this with Cartilage Head and possibly GOF, but the recent abundance of abruptly abandoned story arcs, pointless filler strips, and "character development" that doesn't actually "develop" anything shows that he doesn't usually plan that far ahead (plus he said so in an interview). This is why I'm generally not a big fan of story arcs in webcomics, unless they're particularly well-planned and organized, like Templar, Arizona. Otherwise, the style best suited to the medium is one where there is actually something worthwhile in every strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In any case, you're mischaracterizing the argument. It's not like people who've never read Achewood are coming here and being like "omg where are teh jokes?" The point is we liked Achewood before and now feel like something's missing. So either you think nothing's changed or you didn't like the old stuff as much as we did. Neither of those makes you a 'truer' Achewood fan. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Basically, Achewood's grown up. It's like an experimental avant-noise band who used to dress up like ostriches and defecate on stage while screaming non sequiturs gradually becoming a mid-tempo folk-indie rock trio that sings about life using some mildly clever metaphors. Some people might like this, I don't.

      i think the biggest reason we get major discussions of the comic's current quality is that we're seeing and commenting on this in real time. we appreciate a lot of the earlier strips in hindsight, because we have context and time to mull em over. The ratings of any comic that was posted after assetbar was created will always be a little skewed from what it may have been a couple weeks or months later, had people allowed it to sit in their minds for a bit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
my point: in six months, people reading the archives will notice none of the major differences in quality between now and then that we're seeing and fretting over. though they'll probably be saying the same kind of things to each other then. hindsight.

      Also, a lot of people are just forgetting how many of the much older strips just aren't that funny. We've developed all kinds of quotable memes on this board but here, I just clicked on random comic and got the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=12202002">introduction of Showbiz</a> . Now this is a character development strip from that supposedly precious golden age of 2002, people. The only thing remotely funny is that Ray shouts "DRY AS THE DICKENS." You see anyone make that into a meme lately (DO NOT START IT NOW)? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll click random again and see what I get. Okay, this time I landed on a pretty good one. It's February 1, 2005 and Ray is  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=02012005">still sort of stoned</a>  two days later. He thinks his lawnmower smells amazing and he wants to sell it on eBay, even wondering if eBay "gives an award for blowing people's minds." Add to that the random supplemental vignette of Ray writing his name in a dirty window grate and sliding away like Gumby on ice skates and you've got the recipe for good old fashioned  <em>Achewood</em>  comedy gold. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now I'll do one more random comic. Ah! Now this is a great gem that manages to have both characterization and silly comedy. It's Roast Beef  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=04192005">remembering what he was dressed in as a baby</a> . Now, it also happens to be from 2005. In my personal opinion, 2005 was a really good year for  <em>Achewood.</em>  I remember that was the year of  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=08232005">Roast Beef bangs a web site</a>  and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=02242005">Teodor's ninja antics</a> , two of my favorite strips ever. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I clicked random comic one more time and got  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=03282002"> another one from 2002</a> , specifically the scene when the cats are about to dance like they got ass in they pants, but then one more click and I'm in 2007,  <em>during the age of Assetbar, mind you</em>  and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=03272007">it is glorious</a> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
So yeah try clicking random comic once in a while and see where you go. You will probably land on more than a few strips from the olden days that just ain't that funny that you forgot existed. I mean the man puts out more than 200 strips a year, people. People  <em>do</em>  five way too much. It is a problem.

      Yeah, this has never been a comic that'll blow your mind every single day (excepting '05, of course). That having been said, I'm really in no position to comment on the current state of the strip, as I've been on a self-imposed Achewood hiatus since May. I've liked the strips I've read since I've been back. That's all I know.

      I liked the Red Meat system.  Each rating a user gives goes towards their running total, and the score of an individual strip removes that average bias.  An average rated strip ends up being a 0, and I guess it could potentially range from -4 to  4 depending where a given person's average vote is (using the 1 to 5 scale anyway).  If they only rate 5's, their votes aren't worth anything.

(I was explaining it because of  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231054858/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eL06dz1Ymg">this advert which is literally on TV</a> .)

      On an only partially related note, the brother of a friend of mine has somehow come to calling 7-11 "the sevvie." So there's a fun, British-sounding slang term that actually isn't British at all so you can have fun using it and not get punched in face.

      I thought he meant "ay-oont", like:  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Romanes  <strong>eunt</strong>  domus" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've heard most Wisconsiners say "Ant", but after hearing "Awnt", some became self-conscious about referring to insects around out-of-staters. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The "R" sound added to the vowel ending of a word (I believe) is mostly British-European inflection, but the U.S. East Coasters also might be prone to similar sounds. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If most Americans have the similar-sounding pronunciations for 'Advertise' and 'Advertisement', then how do the Europeans pronounce  <strong>'Advertise'</strong> ?   <br/> 
Is it: "I'm go to [ Ad- <strong><em>Ver</em></strong> -Tiss ] my prawn scones in the Examiner."?

      It is my impression that the "Awnt" pronunciation occurs only in New England.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, "Ideer" seems to me to be a Boston thing, even though the Boston accent is known for dropping Rs, not adding them. <br/> 
 <br/>

      There's a weird phenomenon in both Britain and Boston where they drop the R's from the end of words, but add R's when the words end with vowels. I think it has to do with not wanting to have to make the unavoidable sort of grunting sound that happens between a word that ends with a vowel and a word that starts with the same vowel. It is quicker/more efficient to say "That ideer always comes up" than "That idea always comes up." <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I don't really know what I'm talking about at all. And I say "ant" for both the insect and my relative, because I live in California, and we do not like vowel differentiation in California.

      And also that R-at-the-end-of-words-that-don't-end-with-R thing! I do not know if all English accents do this, as there are a lot of them, but when I was at Oxford, one of the first of many things that confused me culturally was the way one of the exchange program staff (Stephanie) referred to another staff member (Milena) as "Milener."

      That "unavoidable sort of grunting sound that happens between a word that ends with a vowel and a word that starts with the same vowel" is a glottal stop. It often is represented by a silent "H" or is implied in certain vowel combinations (try for example "uh-oh"). It is a muscle reaction of quickly closing and opening the vocal chords, and like any muscle, control can be gained practice. So, it isn't completely unavoidable, and doesn't have to resemble a grunt at all.

      As a native Bostonian, I feel like we're not so much into adding the extra R, but dig the hell out of some extraneous H. That would probably come out more to the effect of "That ideah always comes up." It's not hugely noticeable until you get into "gotta go, my Ahnt is heah. Talk to you latah" territory.

      I fear I agree. I never cared for her at all. And I like this new incarnation even less. At least the original Tina had the wherewithall to keep Ray in line, and she dumped him, not the other way around. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This one is pathetic, all taking on multi-year projects like a MBA and shit to win him back, like she's got no personal ambition and can only borrow his. Yech! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I like Ray not being alone and all, but please, Chris, give us some one worthy of his Rayness!

      I think we need to start a contending group, called the "Liebotters", who claim that every secondary character is actually Liebot in disguise.  It happened once, so it's pretty likely it has happened again and nobody realized.

      HOLY CRAP!! IT'S AN UPHOLSTERY BUTTON!! <br/> 
 <br/> 
In panels 2, 4, and 8, there is some round thing on the end of the toothpick holding device in Ray's drink.  Also, in panel three it is on Ray's cheek, just of the edge of the glass.  In my mind I filed it away as some weird ornamentation on the end of the THD, like a logo or emblem. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then, on the tenth or twelfth reading of the strip, I realized it is a button on the upholstery of the booth. <br/>
