      yeah um basically it is a Thing at the Onstad house. i'd guess that Todd never pays since he's like never there y'know all goin' to Hell probably around the time it's due, being hella frustrating but what can you do about it you know he was just made in a session of hot volcano/burrito action. can't expect anybody to have such as manners or cares about stuff like that when your first real act in life is murdering someone.

      Todd lives on the golf course, according the Achewood environs map.  He only crashes in a pissed-on t-shirt at the Onstad household every once in a while.

      I guess it says a lot about the books I'd prefer to read, written by the Achewood cast.  In order: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1)  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Harry Potter and the Difference Between Alternating and Direct Current</span>  by Roast Beef <br/> 
2)  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">H.P. and the Hanoi Hilton</span>  by Lyle <br/> 
3)  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Under The Etruscan Sun</span>  by Teodor <br/> 
4)  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">The CASE of the MYSTERY</span>  by Phillipe. <br/> 
5) Any of Ray's nonsense. <br/> 
6) Any of Cornelius' "low-yield" romance novels he makes to pay the bills. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Though his kids books may be worth catching.

      Sweat is one of Teodor's more common outfits, isn't it?
