It might be that it's nearly a year and a half later, and judging by the fact he's able to afford living in Ray's neighborhood his "plastic surgeon" who "reattached his face" was "probably" "good." Who knows where he got his chica eyebrows and bathroom dye job? Maybe he thinks that's sufficient evidence, since Ray won the Fight, for all of his peers to believe Ray's story.

      Roast Beef has such a quirky, off-beat, unexpected sort of genius. It's very endearing. I'd never think of a false advertising an ultra-patriotic free cheese sandwich as a means of ridding myself of pesky Christian fundamentalists and such, but he comes up with it just as easy as breathing.

      Hey, thanks for replying with some actual reasoning. That's dope. Anyway, I believe this strip is still within the standards of what we can expect of Achewood, since the comic has always shown a strong character development curve, and it has remained consistent with it. No one complained when Beef and Molly paired up, even if it was breaking the character stereotype of 'eternally depressed and socially incompetent'. A big part of what we appreciate in Onstad's work is how he managed to create endearing characters we can relate to, and then set them off to be free and grow.

      Not at all.  I actually found the last panel especially true to my own conflicting feelings on the subject.  I think that, when it comes to large life decisions, we all have our inner Ray, indulgent, impulsive, all jumping into the ocean with no life jacket, as well as our inner Beef, shy, scared, all running from any challenge or gamble. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess what I am trying to say is that it is basically a thing.
