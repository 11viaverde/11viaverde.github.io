      Where I go to medical school (somewhere on the atlantic coast), the pediatric residents keep a running list of actual names of patients that come through the hospital.  It probably violates some sort of HIPAA rule to even keep the list, but there are some hilarious-ass names on there, all of them real patients.  There is a pair of identical twins named Kenya and Kanye, Eileen Down, Queef, and my personal favorite, Steele Darke Cannon.  All of these are real patients.  I'll have to take another look at the list next time I'm in the residents workroom.

      Actually I knew a guy named Nam once, and he was from Vietnam.  I thought it was a gratuitously eponymous name given him by his adoptive family (who were French,) until I learned that it's apparently a very common name in Vietnam.  I can't recall but it may have some meaning unrelated to the name of the place, or the name of the place simply is expounding on the meaning, or some such.. I forget.. you know.. I can't keep any of that stuff straight, what with it being all ching chong wing wong and such.

      This is so subtlely stupid that it has always made me laugh more than those "out there" names. <br/>

My roommate had a white-trashy family in her hometown that really wanted a boy for their first child, and they were dead set on naming him Keith.  Their first child was a girl, but they were undaunted, and decided to name the girl...Keithette. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Their second child  <em>was</em>  a boy, however, and, single-mindedly, they  <em>still</em>  named him Keith.  So they had Keith and Keithette. <br/>

      I was working at a bookstore about 6 years ago when a custome was handed me a check for payement.  As I asked for a driver's license, I looked at the name on the check (first name changed to protect the innocent, barely, and b/c it doesn't fit into the joke): <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maria B. Cocks <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had a bit of a giggle, mentally, and then looked up to see her driver's license, which showed her full middle name.  Now, she must've been the type to take her maiden name as her middle named when she got married; but really, she shouldn't have.  Her full name: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maria Buffaloe Cocks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I struggled.  But then again, who wouldn't, with a buffalo cock?

      Isn't living in Tennessee great? When I was a lad, I knew an old married couple named Ibby and W.R. ... Cook, was it? I think they're both dead now, as they were 80 or so when I was in elementary school. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, W.R.'s name doesn't stand for anything. He was named after a friend of the family. His first name is literally just the two letters "W R". Caused him no end of hell on filling out forms, getting a driver's license, et cetera. They wouldn't give it to him without him telling them what the letters stood for.

      Anybody seen Teletubbies? <br/> 
 <br/> 
When my son was born a female doctor came onto the ward to do some checks and told us about a couple who had a baby boy born with jaundice the week previous. This couple already had a little girl who was with them in the hospital. They couldn't think of a name for the boy until their daughter, noticing that the child had a yellow tint pointed at him and shouted 'it's Laa-Laa!'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah, you guessed it. They named the poor bastard Laa-Laa. Fuckers.

      My point.  I just tried to think of the funniest looking corpse I could.  Plus I have Don on the mind.  I comissioned my sister to make a painting of Don Knotts making out with Steve Buscemi.  Because that is a painting one can be proud of.

      Yep! He is from a place called Harford County, Maryland. I wikipediad him because I am a wikipedophile, and out of curiosity and sort of to check whether the lady in the story was right to allow herself to be boned by him (on the basis of looking at a photograph only, obviously; I concluded probably yes). It doesn't have a pronunciation guide though - what a faux pas.

      I thought this would be a good time to mention something that happened earlier this week. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I went to go see Forgetting Sarah Marshall at a local theater, but it was so packed I had to park in the side alley. There was a couch beside a door at the back of the theater and it just so happened I parked directly in front of it. As I walked by I noticed it smelled strongly of spray-on deodorant, but I paid it no mind and hurried into the theater. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once it was done it was quite late and I was walking back to my car. I noticed, though, that there were several people on the couch, and in the hands of one of the figures was a coarse red ember that had to be the burning glow of marijuana in a small glass pipe.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Things became a little bit awkward. All three kids looked up at me like raccoons when you find them digging through your garbage. I nodded as I walked by and one said, "Hey." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I said, "Hey." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"What's up," he said.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Not much," I said. "You?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Not much." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Okay." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Cool, cool," he said.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
There was a good ten seconds of uncomfortable nodding as I ambled up to my car.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"So," he said. "Uhm... That an Achewood shirt?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I looked down. It was indeed my rabbit ambulance shirt, though I had forgotten.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Yep," I said.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
He nodded and grinned. "All right, man. All right." I noticed that his intonation matched the black gardener at the cemetery in  <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>  almost exactly. You know, the guy that says, "Hey, Baumer! All right! All right!"? Of course you do.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then I got in my car and drove off. It seemed a fitting scenario for an Achewood reference to bring us together.

      Yes. Here's how it works: <br/> 
 <br/> 
-Triple penetration in the groin area (yes, it's possible, look up Annabel Chong) <br/> 
-Double oral (two guys have to be standing close to her head at 45 degree angles) <br/> 
-Each hand used for a handjob <br/> 
 <br/> 
One of my friends suggested that an 8th person could partake via a footjob, but come on now, that's just ridiculous. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As far as I know, this has never been done. Somehow, the Internet has created things like swap.avi, but not something like this.

      This is because you, like me, live in Oklahoma.  There is not an ocean within fifty thousand miles of where we live.  Sushi made from fish that has been dead less than a month can be good.  It's mostly a texture thing, but the taste is pretty fun too.

      Are those people paying huge amounts for it? <br/> 
 <br/> 
The thing about sushi is that basically you need fresh fish (which is really expensive in england) which needs to be of the highest quality (arg), then you need it to be prepared by someone who has been trained to do all of the delicate cooking steps (flavouring, cooking, cooling, and storing the rice), and who has been trained to vet the raw, fresh fish for safety (fish have hell of nasty parasites).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even if it weren't fashionable and delicious, sushi would be hell of expensive, but it also commands a premium.

      I used to work in a French Fry factory.  Did you know that every McDonald's french fry is photographed while they are all on a moving conveyor belt tripping along at some 20 or 30 MPH or some such, and while they are still moving, a robot cuts out any brown spots.  They are then sorted according to length, with the ones that are too short or too long going to non-McDonald's products like the B-grade bags of fries in the grocery store.  Man, they got statistical models of how the heat from the oil travels through the fry as it is cooking. <br/>

      you might have been in a counterfeit McD or maybe they were serving counterfeit fries.  To save money so they didn't have to buy the fries from the corporate Franchise.  If you are at a sort of out-of-the way McD , always check to make sure it's legit.  One way you can tell is the length of the fries.

      But you're white, aren't you?  That's the only reason you love sushi.  If you were of a darker complexion, like myself, you would have the credibility to pull of a sushi-eating habit.  As it is, you'll have to stick with twinkies and pasta with a bit of ketchup on top, while you watch me and my colored brethren slurp down sushi and watch The Wire with guilt-free glee.

      I've never really understood that. I live in Austin and Tex Mex is plenty authentic. There are sought-after people paid tons of money because they figured out how to perfect Tex-Mex food. It's not Interior Mexican food, no, nor is Quebec- or some Vietnamese food genuinely French, but that doesn't mean that poutain isn't delicious. Nor does it mean that just because something was made along the Texas border and not in the Yucatan Peninsula doesn't mean it doesn't taste good.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm guessing you're thinking of something like Taco Cabana or some chain restaurant that dispenses meat with a contraption like a caulking gun. If you seriously think Tex-Mex isn't authentic, then you haven't had any before.

      You may be right.  Most Tex Mex I've experienced has been through crappy chains that brag about serving it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One I will not try, no matter what:  Carlos O'Kelley's.  All that makes me think of is corned beef tacos.  And yes, I know the most of the Irish haven't heard of corned beef and cabbage for St. Patrick's day. Somehow that makes it worse.

      give it up already, you are not going to make people stop calling them avatars.  We all realize that they do not fit the technical definition for the word "avatar", but many of them, like the one you just responded to, are not technically "icons" either.  An icon is a singular, static picture, so multi-frame gifs don't count.  You really need to find something new to bitch about, because your shit is tired.

      Becky. It's short for Rebecca. I was originally Becky, but I changed the spelling when I was like ten years old because I was so sick of having the same name as like a million other people I knew (this is still the case.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
The thing is, as I've gotten older I've grown to hate it when people spell their names in stupid way. This makes me a raging hypocrite, but I'm so used to my own spelling of it that I can't imagine going back to spelling it the normal way. It freaks me out when people spell it like that. So I'm stuck.

      I worked with a dude over the summer who was married to a Becci.  He was a cool dude, so I can only imagine she was a cool gal. <br/>

That same office employed a Sherry Bailey.  I was glad to find out after a few weeks that I wasn't the only one who had this overwhelming desire to walk in and sing the Four Season's song of the same name.

      Correct me if I'm wrong: I always thought a lot of those bikes missing front wheels were missing them on purpose.  I used to know cyclists living in a city that would always detach their front will and bring it with them into whatever building they were going into (if it was for prolonged period of time), so that no one would steal their bike.

      You may be almost right:  If you have a quick-release hubs and don't lock both wheels to a stationary object, you are asking to have the unlocked one stolen.  Some cyclists will lock one to the rack and bring the other one with (usually the front) because that may be easier than locking both.  And then, some of the bikes you are seeing belong to people who forgot to do that, and the wheel is stolen.

      I made the move from black to earth, but along the way picked up some ideas from the "ridiculously bright" bandwagon. Earth tones mixed with ultrabright pinks and greens are becoming pretty super common up here in the Northwest... <br/> 
Bike punks and art punks collide up here, and drink Pabst to  <em>In on the Kill Taker.</em>  What results, somehow, is a culture of hippie/artist/punk philosophies with strong overtones of party, and either no guitars or too many drummers. The Pacific Nothwest has evolved beyond its own black period of superheavy, overwack grunge, into an era of absolute weird. I am glad to live in such a time.

      I worked at an independent record store in college that was part of a series of interconnected "artsy" boutiques all in the same building.  One side had the record store, at the other end was a nice book store, and sandwiched in between: a bead shop  <strong>and</strong>  a hippie-style card/gift shop.  Luckily the clientele didn't mix too heavily.

      what's the bad news heccibiggs?  if it's something you don't want to talk about, could you just make something up instead to satiate my curio osity? <br/> 
 <br/> 
was your day like this?: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well Frank settled down in the Valley <br/> 
and he hung his wild years <br/> 
on a nail that he drove through <br/> 
his wife's forehead <br/> 
he sold used office furniture <br/> 
out there on San Fernando Road <br/> 
and assumed a $30,000 loan <br/> 
at 15 1/4% and put a downpayment <br/> 
on a little two bedroom place <br/> 
his wife was a spent peice of used jet trash <br/> 
made good bloody marys <br/> 
kept her mouth shut most of the time <br/> 
had a little Chihuahua named Carlos <br/> 
that had somekind of skin disease <br/> 
and was totally blind <br/> 
they had a thoroughly modern kitchen <br/> 
self-cleaning oven (the whole bit) <br/> 
Frank drove a little sedan <br/> 
they were so happy <br/> 
One night Frank was on his way home <br/> 
from work, stopped at the liqour store <br/> 
picked up a couple of Mickey's Big Mouths <br/> 
drank 'em in the car on his way <br/> 
to the Shell station, he got a gallon of <br/> 
gas in a can, drove home, doused <br/> 
everything in the house, torched it <br/> 
parked across the street laughing <br/> 
watching it burn, all Halloween <br/> 
orange and chimney red then <br/> 
Frank put on a top forty station <br/> 
got on the Hollywood Freeway <br/> 
headed north <br/> 
Never could stand that dog

      When I was 7, I had a TMNT themed birthday party, complete with TMNT plates, cups, cake, candles, and a Pin the Pizza on the Turtle game.  This would not normally be that funny, except for the fact that my sister, who is nine years older than me, has a birthday two weeks after mine, and we always had one large, unified family party for both birthdays, alternating who got to pick the theme every year, so my big sister got a TMNT-themed sweet 16 party.

      Giving rich people more money will help out poor people, because those rich people, who have heretofore been unwilling to part with any more of their wealth than they actually have to, will suddenly start paying their employees more, and the trickle-down effect is good for eveybody.  That is a brilliant economic strategy if I've ever seen one. <br/>

      I drastically oversimplified the concept, but the basic concept is that the money would start at the top, through tax breaks to corporations and the like, and gradually make it's way down to the workers at the bottom of the ladder, benefitting everyone along the way.  The reality, however, is that the "trickle-down" effect doesn't actually happen, because the money starts at the top and stays at the top, helping only the people at the top.

If we get any further into this we will all be lamed into oblivion, but I'm not quite sure what you're referring to. Under Reagan the deficit increased threefold and immediately afterward there was a recession and increased unemployment. He sure did a great job closing all those mental hospitals though.

      Aw hell, it's late and I'm bored. You know, I used to think there was some merit in nonpartisanship, until Bush happened. Now it just seems like a willful pose.

Anyway, all that aside, the last 8 years should have put the final nail in the coffin of Reaganomics. Enron and the subprime mortgage crisis were a direct result of deregulation, and now we're paying to bail out Bear Sterns. Seems like there's more sucking-up than trickling-down. <br/>

      Umm, no. Sarbanes-Oxley was passed *after* Enron. So that's not evidence of something being abolished and leading to people stealing things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, the whole deal with securitisation means that the division between US deposit banks and US investment banks wouldn't have made a difference to the volume of lending, which appears to have been ultimately financed in large measure from abroad. Even if it hadn't been, securitisation would have been used by the deposit banks to earn money on origination. So that wouldn't have stopped them lending money cheaply to poor people. <br/>

Yes, but not directly because taxes were cut. Rather because spending was  <em>not</em>  cut. This is the same mistake the Bush administration made: you can't cut taxes and still keep spending the same amount (or more) of money you were spending before. <br/>

      Ah but you forget...they do it in a way that causes them to profit. Now, because there are a bunch of poor people who don't have stuff, they are in pretty stiff competition for things like low-paid hourly jobs. Meanwhile, the rich are appropriating most of the value so created to their capital contribution. That's the thing about capitalism.

      I would just like to say that I have been reading Achewood for a good while, and as much as I love Onstad's work, I feel like this community adds a whole lot to it. It has been my pleasure to read all of your comments, hear your woes about assetbar, experience your chubbies, lames, hopes, and fears. I think I just said experience your chubbies. Regardless, I decided to participate in the discussion of this particular strip  merely to express that yes this strip was great, but your comments on it have been some of the funniest things I've read in a long time. <br/>

      I'm convinced the only improvement to the community would be a few posters who deconstruct the strip at a deeper level, like we had way back when. I recall some instances of dudes treating a specific strip with the care and observance usually reserved for Kafka or Hemingway, and when that was around my day always felt affirmed:  <em>I'm not the only one who sees literary genius here.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know, I would be one such dude, but I'd like to get some college learnin' in first. Ah well...might as well go for it.

      I think we have too much of that going on as it is, but that's just me. Unless you count retardo's "you're gay" 'analysis' of Onstad as some kind of Freudian deconstruction. Anyway, if you insist: <br/> 
 <br/> 
-Beef's deliberate commodification of his own stereotypical attitudes and utterances displays a self-awareness that borders on pastiche. <br/> 
-His dismissive response to the activities "trashy white people" is predicated on his own insecurities at formerly being a member of that subclass and thus represents a distancing through reaction formation. <br/>

But come on people! save your nostalgia for something a little less lame and cliched than the whole "Man, this forum used to be great before the jerks got here". <br/>

suggestions for other ill considered nostalgias: <br/> 
1.the 60's <br/> 
2.college <br/> 
3.the time before Al Gore got fat <br/> 
4. or the most popular one in eastern europe: pre 1991!

      Ahh, teletext. Whither went thou, my dear friend? This might be far too obscure, but I don't suppose anyone remembers the Paramount Comedy Channel's mailbag thing? It reminds me a lot of assetbar, really.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just with only four colours. And an editor. And only being available to Sky subscribers in Britain. I could go on... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I feel I should clarify my earlier comment. I wasn't complaining about people going off-topic and whatnot, just that my computer can't handle the sheer weight of comments. A complaint that seems pretty fucking pointless considering the facehandavicon saga that's just round the corner from this strip...

      I remember, though it was just about to move online when I found it, so I never got to post. I think you can still see the last few posts if you have the right tv/setup. All I remember is that some of the posters had met up and later married. <br/>

I also must contribute a bad naming:  No one will believe it, but I swear it's true:  An Iowa teenager several decades back, much in the news when the girl's basketball team made state, named Fonda Dicks.

      I think it was actually the kid's middle name, or he had a normal middle name, or something like that, so he wouldn't have to actually go by the name Kal-El. <br/>

So at least Mr. Cage (who, by the way, chose his last name based on the comic book character Luke Cage, the Iron Fist) was sort of practical about it.

      I don't remember all the names, but a number of them were obtained by using a K where there would normally be a C. So besides Kevin, Kyle, Keith, etc. there was also Kaleb, Kris, maybe a Konrad, etc. Which just made it more obviously intentional.

      I take issue with your misuse of the word "respectively". Respectively is only used to mean that the order of a list of names or descriptions should correspond to the order of a previously used list of names or descriptions. So it would only be used if you'd said something like "there was a kid with loose bowels and a kid who liked to chew on styrofoam - their names were Saddam and Hussein, respectively."
