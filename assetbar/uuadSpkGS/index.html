      It seems appropriate to be this way. I mean, think of the ring as Beef's honest-to-God affections for Molly, made solid. He overthinks it and works hard as hell on it, then gets crazy nervous when Molly surprises him, and she just likes it immediately, overlooks all of his neuroses, and grabs at it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Beef needs someone like Molly very badly. His life's very codified - he imagines interactions with others as taking place in a rigid system of rules which he's incapable of understanding. Molly, rather than thinking about the world, thinks about the people in it, especially Roast Beef, and she recognizes his sweetness and just blows right through all the silly complications he makes for life. She's much more instinctual. She may not know why Beef made the ring, but she knows she likes it and wants to wear it ight away.

      You know what?  That story gets better - in the sense that this version of the mnemonic, if it's true, is even more reprehensible... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've heard that mnemonic before, but the version I heard was "-Black- Boys Rape Our Young Girls But Violet Gives Willingly".  Can't tell you if one version of or the other is "authoritative" - and the guy who told me about it isn't the type to be proud of that kind of racism - but nor is he the type to sweep history like that under the rug. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I took a rather more mundane approach to remembering the color code - black is zero, because it's the absences of light.  Brown is one...  just because - and then the next six are the colors of the rainbow, in order.  And then I almost never have to deal with parts with 8 or 9 values, so I don't worry about gray or white.  :)

      Did you ever know anyone named Violet? I am curious about this. <br/>

Well, I guess it could have been any name beginning in "V"- Victoria, V... <br/> 
I am sorry to say that at this point I can't think of any more female names beginning in "V". Thank you for your consideration. Life jackets are located under your seats.

      Notice how Molly always has some interesting way to phrase bad things happening? For instance, Roast Beef isn't staring at somebody's chest; he staring at them so hard that he's going to stave their chest in if he keeps doing it. Some kid didn't get his hand ground up in a blender - and by the way, OUCH - he made a "hand-flavored frappucino".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe all that time she's spending around Beef is giving her a lot of practice in how to soften terrible events.  <br/>

Also, it's one of the sweetest strips in Achewood.

      a friend of mine got engaged in a very similar way.  He had a few extra bucks on him, and he said, "I know! I'll by my girlfriend a ring for no apparent reason!"  He then tried to give it to her, and she just squealed and said "oh, yes Johnny! I will marry you!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
needless to say, they are no longer engaged (in fact, he married someone else recently).

      I was sorting out my own marriage during the time of this story arc. I'm Canadian, she's never left Poland. She's not even allowed to visit Canada yet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Through the stress of planning an international marriage, combined with the language barrier and the mountain of immigration work hanging over our heads, we had a lot of fights and a lot of times where it looked like the whole situation was almost a bust. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, every day I was reading Achewood, specifically this story arc, and damn but if that didn't set my shit straight and prod me along the path of not being an idiot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is three months after that. We had an INSAAANE little wedding (30 guests, 32 fifths of vodka drained) and the immigration paperwork is ready and waitin' to be mailed off. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As Achewood fans we are all very happy to incorporate this stuff into our daily lives and lexicons. In retrospect I am grateful for this, because at a time when I had a dog-doodoo mindset clouding my view of my own wonderful situation, the example of these two comic strip cat characters made me slap myself in the brain-face and tell myself "MAN WHY YOU GOT TO DO A THING. JUST COME REAL, DOGG."
