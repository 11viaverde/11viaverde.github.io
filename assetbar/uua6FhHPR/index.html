      I've often wondered about that. Finally got around to looking...  there are lots of Firefox  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100110031955/https://www.kashifblog.com/2008/11/6-firefox-auto-reload-refresh-plugins.html">plugins</a>  that would work. Check4Change looks promising. <br/>

I'm sure there's one out there that will send an email once something changes. <br/>

On that note, I'm sure there's someone out there with a Blackberry just for getting these notifications. Running to a PC all spazzing out and sweating when they hear that special Achewood ringtone.

      A Craigslist ad where they are seeking another female or couple (NO SINGLE MALES) to swing with. She is very bi and loves oral, he is 7.5 inches cut. They love sex and are into just about everything (light bondage, roleplay, anal, dp) except scat and pain.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
We see the photos at the bottom. Them together at such as a family vacation smiling happily, the sort of photo you have probably seen in your own parents' photo album. Him, slightly paunchy and ever-so-slightly balding and his kind of chubby wife looking a bit too happy in that way that some middle-aged women do. We see her wearing that sort of supposedly sexy lingerie that has a lot of sheer fabric and maribou, but doesn't really show a lot of skin aside from where it leaks out at the edges, but is nonetheless crotchless with peek-a-boo cups. You see her splayed out on the bed, she is cupping her breasts and trying to lick her own nipple, her breast sags enough that she is almost able to accomplish this with some obvious straining. You see her leaning, nude, over the arm of a sectional, floral print sofa, the built-in recliner-style footrest has been left out as she bends down low with her legs apart, spreading herself before the camera. You see her being penetrated, reverse cowgirl. Even as a still photo it appears to be in motion. The time and date stamp is in the corner, two years prior.

      Sorry to go OT when the topic is first posts... <br/> 
but the continuity of the artwork is so unusual that it seems deliberate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Note that Vlad's body keeps changing shape all through the strip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In panels 1, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 13 he has rounded shoulders and extra 'lats' down the side. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In all other panels he has squared-off shoulders and a thinner torso.  <br/>

      I'm saying that, considering he lived in California, and we had a huge mortgage crash, and he just had to move, and he personally said he never thought he'd ever be moving, that it's likely his house got foreclosed or something. <br/>

      He did indeed.  It even mentioned it in the pleb section as well.  Trouble is, if the state forces you out, you get a touch under market value.  Market value of a house right now is less than market value of a book made of things theguitarhero has said here.  He got dicked on selling the house.  Then he buys a new house that costs very little, and is going to get a neat low mortgage, but still has to pay the zillion little fees that come from homebuying.  His current cash situation isn't great.  And good god in my pants, he must have absurd stress.  People should say nice things about his dick or give him some head or something.  If I had stalked him to his home, I'd send him a bottle of what's in your avatar

      I totally missed that. In my head he was upgrading his living arrangements to a huge house. He was making millions from the website and store and from the books - there's five copies of the GOF at the bookstore down the block from where I live and that's pretty much halfway around the world from California, so in my head Onstad was super successful and never had money issues. It was wishful thinking.  <br/>

      It kinda sucks that SCOTUS totally dropped the ball in the New London case a few years ago. I mean, they had a chance to rule against one of the more egregious abuses of eminent domain (taking land to give to a private corporation under the doctrine that the tax revenue will benefit the community more), but they didn't and they actually upheld it. To the degree that even Bush was, for one very brief moment such as the lifetime of a new element in a particle accelerator, right when he disagreed with it.

      I expected that, as obviously it's a strong statement. The Oscars are kind of bull (read: political) anyway, so I'm not sure why I actually care, but here goes: <br/> 
 <br/> 
I won't claim that Danny Boyle deserved the Oscar in the year he made the film Trainspotting, as I am sure I would meet much contention by trying to claim it had better direction than the English Patient or even the venerable Fargo (which was the runner up). What I would like to contend, though, is that given the man's talent at direction (my favourites are 28 Days Later and Trainspotting), and some of the unremarkable movies that have been nominated for Best Director in the 90s and 00s, it was either just horrible timing or politics that kept him away from the award. In the case of 28 Days Later, I think there was small chance of him even getting a nomination, even though the movie is a beautifully crafted atmospheric piece. In terms of direction, that movie succeeded in everything it set out to do, but I think that the Oscars are kind of 'above' zombie movies, so it didn't even get a nomination (forgive my disdain, but I think it deserved a nomination above Chicago). That being said, I guess I don't really care all that much about the Oscars, but I can say that I was happy to see a director whose movies I consistently enjoy get recognized.

      And if you're wondering why I can say that I don't care all that much about the Oscars and still make comments about who got nominated what year, it's because I decided to do a little research instead of making my reply COMPLETELY on personal bias.

      No, I too no longer care about the Oscars, but still care a bit about what wins and doesn't. I guess I don't afford them credibility, but I do judge them as a sort of cultural barometer and it's always a shame to see bad or mediocre things praised. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Though a fan of zombie films I really didn't care for  <em>28 Days Later</em>  and would not even call it a zombie film as it clearly has no zombies in it. The first half was OK, but it just went off the rails in the second half. I think the alternate, unfilmed ending mentioned on the DVD where they work for a cure would have worked a lot better and might have changed my opinion entirely. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would claim that  <em>The English Patient</em>  did not deserve it and that out of the nominees  <em>Fargo</em>  and  <em>Trainspotting</em>  make for a damn tough choice as each was clearly very well-directed aside from merely being an excellent film. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, personally, I see it as Danny Boyle having made one good film really. I notice nobody talks about how great  <em>The Beach</em>  was. I write the excellence of  <em>Trainspotting</em>  off as a fluke.

      Haha, well of course we differ on opinion. I know 28DL is not a zombie movie but it is sort of a 'zombie' movie. I agree that the plot derailed a bit but the other aspects of the direction certainly didn't, at least in my opinion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just to clarify, Trainspotting wasn't even nominated for Best Director, which I see as an omission. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unfortunately, I hesitate to comment on The Beach. I enjoyed it at the time, a lot, but I was also 12. I really enjoyed 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later even had its strong points (although I shudder at the thought of a 28 Months Later, I will probably go see it anyway). I also enjoyed Sunshine quite a bit, and Slumdog Millionaire, I thought, was a really good movie. If nothing else, it was massively entertaining to me, and the direction was definitely part of that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I plan to go back and watch The Beach. He has said since that he didn't like the way he treated it, and also that he would have preferred Ewan McGregor in the title role (I think he has a man-crush on Ewan). Even doing the movie with Leo NOW would probably make a big difference - he was a starlet back then; now, he actually has some acting chops (IMO).

      Agreed on all counts.  This isn't one of Onstad's best Vlad strips; he's been kind of on and off over the last 6 months or so when Vlad has popped up.  The Vlad-isms just ain't firing on all cylinders here.  Oh well. <br/>

Slumdog was saccharine and predictable.  Not horrible, but the love story was completely insincere.  It basically just set it up in a classic fairy tale fashion, and assumed you would buy it.

      Hmmm... I kinda thought they were doing a bit of a Bollywood Homage (proven by credits sequence) as far as the love story goes... fortunately I thought the rough portrayal of Indian life meshed in throughout made it a decent Pulpish type of flick. In that context it was pretty cool.

      I'll wait for the film version of  <em>Shantaram</em>  (if it ever gets made) for a rough portrayal of Indian life. I didn't make it to the love story, but I could see were it was heading. Thankfully it was a DVD and I wasn't in the cinema, so I just went into the next room and played Sensi Soccer.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
For those that care, I choked up watching  <em>Lars and the Real Girl</em>  so I have some kind of heart I think. Its just, what kind of Primary School teacher teaches slum kids Alexandre Dumas? I guess  <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</em>  was right, clumsy foreshadowing is a film killer.

      <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</em>  was mainly right about how good it was. Not best film of all time, but solid and fun film that I would definitely recommend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If this isn't enough to spur movie talk I don't know what else I can do.  <em>Tokyo Gore Police</em>  won't be arriving in the mailbox until noon or so. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I did not see  <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>  as it combined two things I have deep loathing for: terrible game show and heart-warming film. I'm not the type of person to like it so I just avoided it. I can't even properly get upset by it, it just seems like a trifle to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Finally got around to seeing  <em>The Vanishing</em>  (original, not American remake) the other day and it didn't do anything for either me or the girlfriend. Kept hearing about how disturbing it was, but it was really fairly predictable and neither of us was even remotely disturbed. I felt like it failed to accomplish the idea of both men being obsessed that it would later hear people talking about and, well, it again wasn't bad, but I felt it didn't live up to the hype and felt more like a sort of generic episode of  <em>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</em>  or such. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, we want to start some debate? I just started  <em>Babylon 5</em> ... <strong>finally</strong> . It took maybe one episode or so to get me deeply hooked.

      I can't agree to that, man.  The original version of that movie is something I never want to see again, for all the right reasons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Spoilers (?)  I think this is the first time I've ever written that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not predictable; it's inevitable.  It's not about the ability to "know what the end is gonna be."  But I'm sure you're aware of that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The perfectly non-chalant descriptions of the developing levels of sociopathy and the pedestrian way of presenting it all was just perfect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That movie will, perhaps sadly, disturb me more than almost any of the most unflinching real-life documentaries.  It becomes a real personal film; it doesn't try to psycho-analyze that much, really, it just shows what goes on, point blank.

      I guess one of the problems is that the ending did, well, nothing for me on any level. Add to that how I already accept the pedestrian nature of evil and well... it just didn't have anything to say to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's like it ran in all excited "Dude, have you heard about  <em>Seka?</em> " and I am busy editing a Seka fan-site.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would also disagree about the ending. I think it was intended to be seen, on first viewing, as a bit shocking and unexpected, but with an element of inevitability that both characters are aware of. Yet it can't stop telegraphing it from the very beginning. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can see what some viewers see in it and why they find it powerful, but for me it was just all kinds of seen it already.

      I don't have a problem with a fairy tale love story, it's just that the one in Slumdog Millionaire wasn't set up well at all.  There's no chemistry between the actors or even between the characters in the story, until about halfway through, it basically turns into "oh yeah, they're in love, by the way."  <br/>

Maybe this is a thing in Bollywood films.  Maybe it's one of the reasons I don't really watch them.

      Off topic, but this post reminds me of my criticism of  <em>Princess Mononoke</em> : The love story, such as it is, feels like it exists only because the plot requires it. There's no chemistry between the two characters and there's no reason for them to be in love, and no explanation for it either. Beautiful animation, but not Miyazaki's best work.

      I liked  <em>Spirited Away</em> , but  <em>Mononoke Hime</em> ? Not very much. I think the heavy environmental theme is part of it, but still... something about it just made me really not like it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It might just be, well, Miyazaki and I are not amigos. Great art and production quality, but not the sort of films I tend to be into. I mean, I also find Pixar to have a record that is far more fail/mediocre than win and I didn't like Disney as a child even. I think I may have been one of the few kids to grow up with absolutely no Disney tapes... or, despite having a VCR, any other children's movies. Just a copy of  <em>Stand By Me</em>  taped off HBO. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not saying that Miyazaki is just for kids or such, but that whole Disney comparison? I can really see where that comes from. Still, a thousand times better than Disney.

      Great. I enjoyed the film, but now that I've discussed, and I'm looking back on it... and really thought about it... well fuck, you're right. I actually did have the feeling mid-movie that the lead character was a freakish Obsessive Compulsive type that couldn't move on. "Romantic Love" portrayed that way is so horribly unrealistic and outdated. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So thankyou fineoakstructure for pointing out my ability to be lead around by the hand in a film and being sucked up in it and then later coming out feeling like I've been manhandled by a Bad Uncle.

      I do find it interesting that most people really wouldn't want them. I mean, you like the breasts on a lady, but just on their own (even taking away the disgusting nature of such a thing, maybe go with a rubber model or such instead) there's really not much interest. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, it s not just the woman. Look at fattybeaver's avicon... we love it. Just tits, bouncing away merrily, no woman in sight. Clearly the idea of breasts alone are interesting, but we still need to have the knowledge that they are attached to a woman, even if she is not visible.  <br/>

      I can accept that you can't just go with the flow and take new things and new ideas as they crop up. I sometimes have this problem with people because my brain will start going off on tangents and then re-enter the conversation much further down the line with things that no longer make any sort of sense or only make sense because of idiosyncratic meaning. In this case it's a fairly simple sort of thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For reasons I'm not entirely certain of I googled "Are you definitely going to die" probably because I didn't entirely get xiaomimi's comment and I wanted to see if I was missing some sort of reference. The first hit was  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100110031955/https://www.popeater.com/television/article/applegate-definitely-not-going-to-die/138886">"Applegate 'Definitely Not Going to Die'"</a>  about Christina Applegate's double mastectomy. It seemed interesting enough, got me thinking, and I applied it directly under what I was reading at the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can see how it doesn't fit with anything in any sort of obvious way and how that might confuse people and, in hindsight, maybe it was a bad choice, but hell... learn to just roll with it and stop worrying about if it makes sense all the time.

Slowly he folds his bulbous human hands over his expansive belly, and he smiles the empty smile of The Mouse.
