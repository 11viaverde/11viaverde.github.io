      This strip actually raises an interesting question. If interviews are to be believed, almost all of Onstad's income comes from Achewood. It's only inevitable that his mother and/or grandmother will, at some point, ask what his job is. When he says that he writes a comic, wouldn't his mother/grandmother DEFINITELY start reading it? Support your own child, you know...

      Hitler was very close to his mother, who spoiled him throughout his life, as he was her only son who survived.  It's hard to say what she would have thought of her son had she survived to see what he became, but it's difficult to believe she wouldn't have been proud.

      Yeah, most of his villainy only became apparent after his death. There's a good chance that his mother wouldn't even have known about the whole Holocaust thing as it was happening, and even if she would have known, who can say she wouldn't have supported it?
