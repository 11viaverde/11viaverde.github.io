      On the brink of cancellation, the experiment found emergency funding when the participants pooled their  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000403/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua6QFCpN">T-Mobile gift certificates</a>  and sold them to a wealthy benefactor for $100,000.  This mysterious patron declined comment, saying simply, "I've got some calls to make.  Dammit, fool, you don't interrupt a man when he's got calls to make."  One of the participants, reportedly named Patrick Reynolds, declined to take part in this trade.  Following a lengthy discussion in which an elderly Welsh woman beat him about the head with a dough hook, Reynolds dug deeply into his pockets and contributed $0.01 to the cause.  As the crowd dispersed, Reynolds was heard to say, "With interest, you understand me?  I expect it back with interest."

      Oh wifeybot and I are of the same mind, she's worked with dozens of kids over the years.  However, as you go through the next decade, keep count of the number of confirmed-kidless people change their mind.  From about 23 to 33 a strong majority decide to brave the awfulness of raising children.

      Agreed. When I was twenty, you could've asked anyone within a 300 mile radius, and they would've been able to tell you that I never in my life would have a baby.

      That's quite a piece of hyperbole there sir.  I don't believe that it is likely that every person who says "I don't want kids" will be immediately shamed by me into reproducing, and then subsequently abandon those babies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My point, which I wouldn't think needs much elaboration, is this.  Having and raising children is, in my experience, a fantastic thing.  However, it should only be done by choice. If you think you would be likely to abandon your child in the woods, or otherwise mistreat them, you should not have kids.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, if you don't want kids because you think it will interfere with your skydiving massage schedule, or your attempt to write the great american novel, then you are, in my opinion, making a mistake. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that's quite clear, so I am going to drop the matter now. <br/>

      Are you saying that it won't interfere with my attempt to write the Great American Novel, or that said attempt is a mistake? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean the Internet has shown us that people can be happy with a wide array of life choices and directions, even if they involve dressing up in fursuits and going to conventions. So it's very possible that a good deal of people who've decided not to have kids are just satisifed with their choice as you are with yours.

      I figured it was a case of in-Achewood-cats-aren't-like-normal-cats-but-a-lot-more-like-humans, so maybe it's just supposed to be one-baby-per-nine-month-pregnancy thing. So Molly's dad figured out she had enough time to crank out ten kids if she got pregnant seconds after she gave birth to each child. Of course, the clover would help her to have more.

      I respectfully disagree. It looks to me like Vlad will will walk from his flat straight to the reception, walk in and up to the bar (still whistling) and order a martini. He will drink it in one smooth gulp, and walk neither slowly nor fast to the centre of the dance floor. Then he will dance the hustle without cease, and irrespective of the music being played, until it is time for him to go. He will leave with someone's recently divorced aunt or godmother.

      Nice try but there is a definite stagger in the line of the grille. Falcons are straight across. You can see the step where the low beam headlight is cut off. That wrap around detail isn't falcon either. It still looks like a Mach 1 Mustang with the wrong shaped lights in the grille.

      The cutoff is odd, but I do think it generally matches the Falcon XB - and the stagger in the grille may be as a result of using a lower resolution photo as a source.  This is the only really good quality picture I found, I've resized it for Assetbar usage but you can clearly see the essence of all the details visible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess I didn't recognize it because it's an Australian model. <br/>

      I think it looks closer to a 71-74 Dodge Charger.  Quick perusal of the internets shows that a few may have had dual hood scoops, and the line of the hood is sharper, like Ramses' whip, above, than the Falcon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Actually, I'm changing my answer to a 1986 BMW 635csi with a custom carbon-fiber hood (explaining the hood scoops).  That would be cool enough for Ramses.   <em>Barely.</em>

      Whew, at least someone else guessed 6-series Beemer, so my 'car culture chops' aren't completely in doubt. But the case for the Falcon is strong...after all, doesn't Ramses have something of Mad Max about him? Great Outdoor Fight-as-Thunderdome? 3,000 men enter, one man leaves?

      The trouble with your theory is that people who buy 6 series are people who like to talk about cars. This goes  double for first generation 6ers. Ramses does not talk about cars. He drives them to significant places or events. He drives very fast, or at a more reasonable place if he so wishes. If they break down he fixes them himself. No police man will ever stop him. <br/>

      That's very perceptive actually.  You're right about the 6 series and its pull on the conversations of otherwise normal people.  I once took a break between depositions by having an hour long conversation about getting a 6 series restored with an Indian (from India and all) Jehovah's Witness.  It was a fascinating conversation.

      Quite untrue. Things in nature tend towards entropy whenever possible. The idea of a self-creating order is simply unfounded. However, that sentiment does not automatically mean a jump in logic towards a creator of all things. That, too, is unfounded. I say don't worry: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Just wait for the wedding, where the universe will right all this "order".

      For the record, they are shut up by dint of being lamed so often.  A high lame total limits how often an account can post.  poing well and proved that it is not due to wants that they post as infrequently as they do.

      I think you haven't been around for the past couple of weeks, so I'll fill you in - what you just described is exactly the problem - people keep laming 'it', so it keeps making new accounts because it cannot conceive of the concept of shutting up. Unfortunately, Assetbar's security is such that you can drive a stolen bus dragging a bunch of rusty bikes through it, so it can keep doing this indefinitely. It has itself suggested that people stop laming it and ignore instead, but of course that only encourages people more, and besides, it wouldn't stop it from making new accounts every so often anyway. The best thing would be if we had more people with spam marking privileges around, but judging from yesterday's strip, there was only one, and he quickly ran out of steam. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now that we've gotten that out of the way, we should note from now on that besides replying to it directly, discussing it as we are doing now is also a form of encouragement and should be avoided. We need to carry about our business of Glengarry references and hastily photoshopped buggery as if we lived in a better universe where abominations of its sort simply don't exist.

      Achilleselbow:  On the spam-marking thing, you all are making me feel like you are the leader of the Axe Gang and I am Steven Chow.  I can mark comments as spam, but you all keep saying to ignore.  Which is it?! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, the "it" thing is totally out of line; that goes to all you folks.  Use an epithet ("that fuckin' jerk") if you don't like him and want to insult him, but don't be like the serial killer in Silence of the Lambs.  You de-humanize yourself more than anything. <br/>

      True, but the fact that they've yet to register alternates (unless they're the same guy; you never know) suggests a strength of character entirely alien to you-know-who. Even poing and snick had the decency to give up after their lame/spam count got too high. <br/>

      Portland is only at gay level orange right now, so I think you'll be OK.  If you'd come a couple weeks ago during the Portland Pride Festival, however, then you would have been overwhelmed, as the city was at gay level red.  They almost had to add level chartreuse above red in order to describe the extremely high level of gayness.  In gayness, this fine city is second only to San Francisco, which is also the only city in the nation more sustainable than Portland. <br/> <br/> <br/> PS: I am not trying to imply that there is any correlation between homosexuality and sustainability, I just know that SF is ahead of Portland in both of these areas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
PPS: I am also not saying that gay people are like terrorists, I just saw fineoakstructure's five-alarm comment and went a little bit beyond.

      I must say that Lainestin is one of the hardest working trolls in the business.  You seldom have a comment up for more than 15 minutes before he/she finds and lames it.  It's almost like Lainestin knows when you're going to be on, or is maybe on at the same time.  Or maybe you don't even have a machine elf and just made up the story to get attention, and we have all been too foolish to recognize it before now.   <br/> <br/> <br/> PS: You would have gotten away with it, if it hadn't been for those meddling kids <br/> 
 <br/> 
PPS: I don't really think that you are your own machine elf, but if you are, then I am awesome.

      Its lame supply gets refreshed every so often, so sometimes it can only lame me a couple times but sometimes it can lame me till the sun comes up in the morning. It must have just gotten a fresh batch the other day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, usually it is not so quick. Sometimes it'll go a couple days without laming me even. I don't know if it goes back to the old strips it missed and lames those, too. I imagine it does not have much of a life, so I wouldn't be particularly surprised.

      Which is better - pegasus or unicorn? A pegasus makes for better transportation, but according to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, the unicorn has 6 times as many health points and can easily take on like 4 pegasi at a time. Also, if a horse had both wings and a horn, would it be a winged unicorn or a horned pegasus?

      Dude a pegasus could lose in a fight with a Toddler. Unicorns, however, will gore their mothers to death if they so much as hear one word they don't like. <br/>

On the other hand,  <em>Pegasi</em>  is a way cooler plurar form than  <em>Unicorns</em> ... <br/>

      Au contraire.   Pegasus was the mascot of my high school, and all together we formed the fightin' City High Pegasi.   Just bunches of budding young Pegasi, ready to take to the skies (of academic achievement) and carry the Bellerophon (of civic and moral duty). <br/>

      It's weird that Pat and Simon are almost identical, but some simple muttonchops (and more clothing) make Simon look like a fairly pleasant, reasonable guy, whereas Pat is clearly a FUCKING ASSHOLE just from his appearance.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe it's effective characterisation that makes me feel this way. Perhaps I'd see it the other way around if they'd always had each other's appearance, I'd associate Tommy Bahama and Lennon specs with being a GODDAMN DICK.

      When my high school phys. ed. class went bowling every week, my team's name was the Lead Hogs (lead as in the metal).   I thought it was an appropriately manly, quirky, yet (this was during school hours) non-outrageously offensive moniker.   Unfortunately the rest of the class thought that it was the Lead-rhymes-with-need Hogs, and made unmerciful fun of us as we proceeded to hog the very bottom of the standings week after long-suffering week.

      I remember the Superquiz part of Academic Decathlon.  It was the most intense event ever.  They would project the question on a large screen as some local TV news anchor read it out, horribly mangling all of the foreign names, tossing her glossy-straight highlighted locks.  A dread silence fell upon the room as we circled our answer choices.  Then, our local starlet would again read each answer choice out and ask us to raise our hands if we had chosen that answer.  This went on until the bitter end, when the teammates of the victorious quiz-taker rushed the stage and swept their new god up in rib-crushing hugs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was almost like having friends.

      Ah. AcaDec. Renaissance was definitely my favorite of my three years, though I really had the whole package. I interned for DemiDec over the summer, led my school's team for three years, kept my school's program from going under, and (most interestingly) ended up dating one of my team members in an unbelievably awkward turn of events that led in our permanent estrangement. <br/>

      Oh, it can totally feel that way for a brief moment. My first year we won regionals, beating the until-then undefeated team. The applause when we were announced for first place was deafening; even though I knew deep down that it was more for who didn't win than who did, it was exhilarating. It was just like one of those '80s movies where the scrappy underdogs beat the rich jerks and all the other competitors cheer and carry the team on their shoulders because they are all extremely good losers.

      Am I the only one who would be just slightly worried to see a doctor at my wedding? It's like saying, "Something bad is going down today. Better be prepared." <br/> 
Although he's probably invited because he's saved Beef's life at least twice, or something like that. So unless he shows up in the uniform, it's probably nothing to be paranoid about.

Beef needed his dead-time to meet Molly - but he needed to be brought back to life again, too, or else...  well, or else nothing, I think.  But the doctor is, in a very roundabout way, the guy who facilitated their first meeting.

      Dear Chris Onstad, <br/> 
 <br/> 
How are you? I am fine. The reason I am writing today is to ask that you please include a scene in the wedding in which Dr. Andretti interrupts Ray in the bathroom, as it has been some years since we have seen this happen, and the new context would make it very funny.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Up yours if you don't include it (but not up yours if you do). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Love, <br/>
