      Amen. My god, gridiron has got to be the most boring spectator sport on the planet. I saw there was a game coming up on ESPN (in Australia) and I thought - you know, I've never watched NFL before. Maybe it's interesting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
After the 30 minute intro (now  <em>intensely bored</em> ) I watched the kickoff and tried to start discerning the rules. After about a minute I had figured out they were kind of similar to rugby; after a couple of minutes someone scored. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I should note that, when this happens in rugby or Aussie rules, there is a two-commercial break before play resumes. That's sixty seconds, and it's what we're used to. In NFL, there is a full 4.5 minute break before we come back to eight minutes of discussion about the play that just occurred. Play resumed, and shortly thereafter halted again... another ad break. At this point I switched over to Scrubs.

      Lionboy, I think most people realize that. But Soticoto is an enormous douche, is proud of all of his douchiest aspects, and spends all day trying to make himself more douchy in ways that he would not naturally be a douchebag were he not trying. Since he is  <em>also</em>  proud of his Asperger's, it is inevitable that he get mercilessly mocked for that, as well. A douchebag vegan will get mocked for his veganism, even though veganism isn't what makes him a douche. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is that unfair? Of course. But making fun of Soticoto for being autistic makes him genuinely angry. And making Soticoto even more miserable than he makes himself is worth causing all the other autistics in the world a little pain.

      1. I live in a smaller suburban city, of 100 thousand, so I wouldn%u2019t know about the noisiness. Although, I can%u2019t imagine that London is much better than New York, so I don%u2019t know what you%u2019re getting at there. I have been to Honolulu, though, and I can%u2019t say it was very noisy there; but that might just be the general relaxed aura that comes with being in Hawaii. :P <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. I don't have a problem with guns. I don't think they're a problem. Frankly, I don%u2019t see why a lot of super-liberal people are so upset about them. I mean, I%u2019m pretty liberal, but that%u2019s one thing that I don%u2019t get. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. I think a "revolting accent" is when you can't tell the difference between the words "law" and "lore." However, I will concede that being unable to tell the difference between the words "madder" and "matter" is also revolting. But in no other respect can I justify a description of any English accent as "revolting." Except maybe the Australian one, but even that one is tolerable. I think you%u2019re just being discriminatory here. I can%u2019t grasp where you%u2019re getting this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
4. We do speak English, and I frankly don't know what you mean by "a mangled frankenstein's beast of what might once have been" English. So we spell %u201C-re%u201D as %u201C-er%u201D and %u201C-our%u201D as %u201C-or.%u201D How is that a huge difference? The only word I can think of that is  <em>really</em>  different from British English in American English is %u201Cyogurt/yoghourt.%u201D Otherwise, I%u2019m not sure what you%u2019re getting on about with this point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
5. Only a few, very bigoted Americans think that way, mostly in the %u201Cdeep south.%u201D <br/> 
 <br/> 
6. I%u2019m not sure what you mean, but I think you%u2019re referring to our foreign policy, which is unpopular even here. Maybe you could clarify. <br/> 
 <br/> 
7. Sadly, I live in a %u201Cred state%u201D and can (to some extent) relate to your observation here. However, I would like to say that there are quite a lot of %u201Cblue states,%u201D mainly in New England, the Great Lakes region, and the West Coast, where Christianity is a lot more moderate, and is not taken quite so seriously.

      I've thought about this... A lot more than anyone should... there are a few ways to look at it and I'm probably gonna get lamed. Ah well. <br/> 
 <br/> 
First of all, what should  <em>Phillipe</em>  write? Football? "Football is popular everywhere but America". Have about 9/10 of your readers going "wtf?".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would imagine someone such as Cornelius would indeed say "Football" or "European Football" as he would know that some people have trouble with the word. Phillipe is five (for the past 6 years) and is not one to make such distinctions. This is his newspaper. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lastly, if someone says soccer, everyone knows they're talking about the little black and white ball being rapidly transported over a field of grass. If someone says Football, it could mean the brown oval or black and white sphere related sport. At this point, despite Europeans offense and American weird nomenclature to name a sport in which the ball is not supposed to be on the ground after the part of your body which is constantly in contact with the ground football, football is a very mixed term around the world. By distinctly using American and European as prefixes for Football, one can avoid this confusion. However, I've never been in a conversation in which it wasn't obvious which "football" was being referenced, that's the great thing about context.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Soccer, according to some hasty Wikiresearch, is a bastardized shortening of "association football" which was coined by an Englishman, Charles Wreford-Brown. Although, no one in Europe could possibly stoop to call it that or even accept that it's an acceptable name. After all the name has only been around for the past 130 years. Utter Hogwash. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Football/Gridiron Football/American Football obviously has roots in rugby but the two have been separated by an ocean for a few centuries so American Football is a lot different. I don't have a lot more to say on the birth, infancy, or fruition of AF because there's no reliable source on it. Basically somewhere in the eastern states, a hundred or so years ago, some people started playing some bastardized version of rugby and said "we want a bigger field and pass forward, oh and scrums should happen more". Lots of people liked it and somehow football was its name in the USofA. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm a canadian who doesn't like sports, so I'm not picking sides, but, like I said, I've thought about this way more than anyone should. Nomenclature is a silly thing and there are better things you can get offended about, like: like who has a worse president/prime minister!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
ps. Europeans: you have a wonderful set of countries, I would love to visit them all, but I can't because I am poor.

      My friend, you know your onions. I respect that. The name of the sport is, for me, a minor beef, and on that beef, you have me pegged down. <br/> 
I am also not a man who takes offence at any slight on the reputation of my national sport.  <em>That is not what bothers me.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
When a man who plays golf (a sport composed mainly of walking) and writes strips about baseball (a fine sport, but one mainly composed of breaks between throws of a ball) disparages a sport whose games consist of 90 minutes of near-continuous action by implying that nothing "happens" in said sport, I think it's only fair to call that man out. <br/>

      Yup, I would agree with saying that he would be out of line saying that nothing happens in a constant-action game when a  <em>lot</em>  happens more than anyone can see in the cameras or hear from the announcers.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But this isn't Onstad's voice and I take it that you are calling out Onstad's ignorance of the game. This is Philippe, he's five and rarely let out of the house. Philippe is generalizing one of the various actions of Soccer (perhaps he makes a simple observation based on a snippet of a game in which a ball traveled from one side of the field to the other and then back again) and made a comment on that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If it were posted on Chris' blog and elaborated on then I would agree that he's being ignorant or wrongfully oversimplifying the sport. There are a few cartoons on network TV that have these disclaimers that go like "The opinions expressed in this program do not reflect those of yadda yadda yadda", I think something like that might be applicable here. I don't know Onstad's personal opinions about Soccer, they might be parallel to Phillipe's and they might be totally different. I just know that he thought it would be funny to make a five-year old otter make naive generalizations about the most popular game in the world. I got a chuckle out of it so I guess it worked.

      Haha, nope! It's pretty basic and unimpressive. You take turns naming Heritage Minutes. If you can't come up with one that hasn't been mentioned yet within some arbitrary (short) time limit (5 seconds?), you have to drink.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am sure people more inventive than my circle of friends have come up with a better Heritage Minute drinking game (I guess ours is more of a challenge than a game). Is an ironic drinking-induced brain cell shortage to blame?

speakin' o which, how does one reply to a post in such a way that the message is indented somewhat in the screen?  i tried the thing where you click on 'reply' but it doesn't do what common sense would have led me to believe was its function.

      Look at Ray, walking past that motorcycle, completely ignoring it, on his way to the basket court.   <em>"You aren't good enough for me, motorcycle.  You don't fight diabetes enough."</em>   In his heart, he apologizes, but dares not ruin the moment with more words.  He walks on.  The motorcycle leans on its kickstand, alone.  It is beyond caring.
