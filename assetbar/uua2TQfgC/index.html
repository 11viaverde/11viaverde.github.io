      I once was in a choir for this IBM conference that was in NZ (a few years ago). It was pretty funky; at one point we sung behind a misted curtain. At the end, when they announced where the next one would be (screen flashes with ten possible sites, then settles on.. Hawaii!!!) we had to run up from behind the audience with party poppers and be really excited, then sing some more, waving to all the japanese guys.

      Two of them, in fact, plus three commas. Looks to me like that dialogue was written for Ray, and Onstad forgot to rewrite it when he gave it to Beef.

      If I was so young when I started Google that I had my nineteen year old mother make the logo for me... Well, in my case I'd be -11 but that's still really impressive.

      I have since revised my rating policy to compare the quality of each strip against only Achewood itself. When comparing this comic to anything else the temptation to give everything a 4 or 5 is far too strong.

He works for AdWords or something, though, and has no idea what I'm talking about.

      I completely agree with Ray in panel 5. At the places where the IBM folks go to lunch, you drink your rye straight. Oh, sure, they'll give you a splash of water, or even a couple of ice cubes, but they'll  <em>look</em>  at you. They'll look at you and everyone there will know that you're doing it wrong. It is assumed that the men will drink rye at lunch, and while it is not assumed of the women, most of them do anyway. (The people who do not drink rye generally drink scotch, preferably Islay single malts, and most preferably very strong ones like Laphroaig. UN mediators are attempting to arrange a peace deal involving Maker's Mark, or failing that, some  <em>kinky Aberlour</em> .)

      Y'know, I never really thought of Google as having a logo, because they don't really have a product you need to seek out and see on the shelf or anything.  It's just there.  So I had to take a look and I agree, it's a stupid bunch of multi-colored letters like a second-grader might assemble on a rainy day.  What a nice cover for a money-sucking ad placement machine disguised as a helpful search engine.  Google exisits to sell you things, people.  You are all suckers.  (I use Ask.com)

      All search engines do that, and the reason most people prefer Google is because a combination of factors, including it's goofy and benign looking logo make the large corporate schlong buried deep in our bowels feel a little less painful.
