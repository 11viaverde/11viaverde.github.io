      We don't really have to worry about that at all actually, as God is just a title and not a name. The God guy from the bible had a name which is forgotten since long long ago as people were hella careful about using it. I don't remember the laws on this one by heart and am too lazy to look it up, but there was something like only head priests were allowed to say the name of God and only in the innermost section of the temple. I think the name was lost in relation to the Babylonian diaspora deal. (Hey, if they managed to displace ten tribes in that ordeal, it's kinda easy to throw in a name as well.)

      thats kind of an inaccurate way to put ithebrew has vowel sounds (obviously) and symbols for them as well, just 99 time out of 100 native speakers leave them out in writting cuz in semitic languages like hebrew and arabic it is the consonants that carry the fundamental meaning and the vowels indicate like the syntactic function of the word and stuff.

      They're actually really good, once you leach the tannins out. They used to be a food staple of the Indians here in Northern California, but they're a huge pain in the ass to prepare. I made some damned fine muffins, though. They taste good, but definitely vaguely foreign, as no one really bothers to prepare them anymore. (For good reason).

      I can't believe no one has commented on the utter child-like genius of the Caramel bit.  This was nearly the exact experience that got me into chemistry when I was five.  My grandmother would make these excellent caramels that tasted better than anything in the stores, and so I tried to plant one, and then my dad explained to me that certain things have to be crafted rather than existing naturally in the world, and then he got me a giant Periodic Table of the Elements (which I still have, framed in all it's glory) and I began assisting in the kitchen, until I almost destroyed the house due to attempting to cook certain chemicals that should not be heated on a gas stove.  Anyway...  If there was an elemental substance "Caramel" it would be more valuable than gold.
