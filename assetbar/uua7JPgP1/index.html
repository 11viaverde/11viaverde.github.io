      Yes, totally and completely. Although there is also some of the lamest, worse-than-Banksy social criticism on the walls as well. Have you seen the one up near Keble that said "Remember What Happened To The Dinosaur"? That was the WANKIEST.

      Apparently, the first two lines have been translated into Serbian and written in the men's room at my college. <br/> 
Not only that, but it seems that the two versions have the same number of syllables or are at least rhythmically similar. I can only compare them to the similarity of the words  <em>mother</em>  or  <em>sister</em>  in several peoples' languages. <br/>

      Two possibilites here: <br/> 
1. Beef has pent-up anger at Ray for not noticing his little cries for help. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. Other possibility: Beef is RIGHTEOUSLY upset at Ray for not being a proper player.  Single-malts and Guinness?  Huey Lewis?  Weed- OK, fine, but out of a bong?  More like a South Bay yuppie than a player.  Might as well be Paul Giamatti in "Sideways."  Don't get me wrong, I like Aberlour just fine but then I ain't no hip hop playa.

      i always kind of figured beef's upset with ray for starting a computer-based business with teodore after what happened to ray and beef's eggminder business. beef is fired by his best friend, then left out of the next business venture and then invited to the celebration party? poor taste, ray. you couldn't even have an eggminder celebration party. you couldn't, because you fired roast beef.

      I have the feeling, given a good enough event in their lives, Ray and Teodor could paint either some or all of the town red--probably using a giant pneumatic sprinkler-system devised by Ray as originally stipulated in a grant for city-wide pipe density reduction.

      This is... my favourite Achewood. Why is Beef driven into righteous rage by this combination of factors? Why does Guinness, Huey Lewis & the News, and weed cause such a fury? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also enjoy the juxtaposition between the scrawled "WORD UP" and the "don't throw stuff at ME".
