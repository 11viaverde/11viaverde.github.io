      Or maybe it's just an assertion that at a fundamental level food is fuel? It is similar to how a true beer lover will enjoy a fine double chocolate stout or IPA one night at home, but when the party rolls around it is time for the Lionshead and Pabst Blue Ribbon.

      It just doesn't seem feasible to ditch the wife and kid only to go to Applebee's...unless there was some sort of pact along the lines of "OK, I'll stay in with the baby while you get to go out, but you can't go anywhere I'd want to go, and I'd better not hear from any of our friends that they saw you out having a good time without us." Hence, Applebee's.

      Y'know, I was kinda assuming the family went together. A discount restaurant is where you go when it's 'family time out'. At least that's how I read it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would assume the 'I' rather than 'we' is because you don't talk to the fan-base about your family much if you want some sense of privacy. <br/>

Shit, that clanks with the years of infant/toddler updates a bit, don't it? <br/>

      Chubby for Lionshead.  I live about a minute away from the brewery.

      So that's what that was about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
No, I don't think you're a douchebag. The idea appears to have been effective, at least. And, anyway, knowing that the wave of mark-as-spam abuse was an attempt to call attention to a problem rather than people being assholes for the sheer hell of it makes me a lot more optimistic about the community in general. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Maybe using more orthodox methods to contact Chris or the AssetBar folks would  <em>also</em>  have been effective, but -- all's well that ends well, I suppose.)

      You are making the assumption that his little 'social experiment' was what he is claiming it was, and not someone just being an asshole in general. Regardless, he has earned a permanent place in my "ignore user" area. He can back-pedal all he likes and create ideas retroactively to explain his actions, but you don't kill people to get laws passed making murder illegal.

      Hmm. On the whole, you're right -- if he's just coming up with an excuse after the fact, he's a jerk.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Similarly, I've sort of given him the benefit of the doubt in that I'm assuming he or others attempted to bring attention to the problem in a non-obnoxious way first. If his initial reaction to the problem was to flag-bomb the fuck out of the comments thread -- yeah, that would be lame.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I don't think the murder parallel works. Killing someone causes permanent damage. Exploiting the mark-as-spam flaw didn't. The flagged messages have been unflagged, and the system was fixed. No permanent harm done; everyone wins. In the meantime, we were annoyed -- but if it hadn't been fixed, it would have proven annoying eventually anyway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suppose I'm also inclined to be forgiving just because it's nice to see everything working again.

      So, when I put someone on my ignore list, does it also ignore all of the Lames and Spams that they've given to other members' comments?  Or does it just hide their messages?  I like the option of hiding comments that get more than 3 or 4 lames, but that doesn't work if the bad actors are still able to influence what I see. <br/>

Thanks!

      How does the lame/chubby system work? There seems to be a certain number of chubbies you give out per page, which makes sense, but lames seem to be limited in a way that i can't make any sense of.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Why does so much laming go on when lames are so scarce and precious? And, how does one tell how many lames one has remaining?
