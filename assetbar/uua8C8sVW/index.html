      I would pay a small fee to have letters from Phillipe slide under the door when I'm making having a big potty break. Sometimes I forget to bring something and reading the back of a shampoo bottle doesn't take very long. "Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, tetrasodium EDTA, cocamidopropyl betaine, glycol distearate.

      Dear Apocowarg, <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hi! Thank you for letting me be your POTTY PAL! Are you making a big potty now? You should, otherwise you might get a tummy ache. I learned this from Mr. Bear after I asked him why he was eating big raisins. He told me they were prunes, but they look like big raisins to me! But if you don't have to make a big potty, then you shouldn't try. You'll be sorry you did!  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sometimes when I make a big potty, I get up and see what I did (after wiping, of course!) only to find that the potty is gone! Does this ever happen to you? I asked my friend R.B. and he told me "aw shucks little man you know you aint supposed to ask nobody about their secret times"  That's good advice! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know how long it might take you to do a big potty, and I don't know how long I should make this letter. Maybe I should stop now. If you aren't done yet, read this letter again only this time pretend that you are from France! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Philippe! <br/> 
Founder, Potty Pals

      I think the amount of lames and lack of replies has less to do with the comment as it does that poing, one of the earlier assetbar trolls, was the one posting it.  Most of his posts have been lamed a lot, and were increasingly ignored.

      My theory is that Onstad just discovered the Clipart on his own, and is trying to find excuses to use it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm thinking a conversation with someone went down like this: <br/> 
"I found this premade logo in Clipart the other day." <br/> 
"Really? What is it?" <br/> 
"Well, it's a P above and to the left from another P." <br/> 
"When have you ever seen a company that has two alliterating 'P' words in their name?" <br/> 
"I dunno, maybe a place called like The Perky Pervert or something. It'd be like... like i dunno, a starbucks or something that vibrates your coffee with a dildo or something." <br/> 
"or maybe a company called potty pals!" <br/>

      I get the feeling that in his previous job Onstad spent a lot of time thinking up cockamamie schemes to make a quick buck. Perhaps Achewood is one of those schemes. I mean, think of it - a cartoon about drunken cats and stuffed animals used to sell ironic T-shirts that will make absolutely no sense to anyone outside of an insular urbanite crowd. Hell, if it's a con it's one I'm happy to be a part of.

      Given that I couldn't be screwed finishing it: C- <br/> 
Not bad, but nothing to write home about. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Credit for defending Comic Sans against overwhelming negative press, minus credit for defending Comic Sans against the fact that it sucks sweaty balls and big floppy donkey dick.  He used illustrations to help get his message across, but only minimally.  His spelling, grammar, and punctuation seemed fine.  He may have split an infinitive or two, but I didn't care enough to notice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the main negative point was the fact that the subject matter, while seemingly interesting and you could tell the man tried to make it so, is still boring as stale turd.  In that, he failed.  Major negative marks. <br/>

C- <br/>

      How much did I not want to know this?  Let me give you an example.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
One semester in college, this guy in my dorm kept using this awful expression, "That smells worse than a bag of assholes."  For almost the entire semester, a primal instinct protected me from thinking any thoughts at all when he uttered that.  Then one day, another guy laughed and said, "Don't you get a nasty picture in your head when you say that?"  I could not avoid thinking about it any longer.  Suddenly, my mind was filled with the miasmic image of a cloth bag filled with ragged, quivering assholes, freshly cut from the living flesh of dozens of victims, bloody and smeared with the fecal matter that their bowels could no longer retain.  I did not vomit, but I did describe the image to the first guy in enough detail that he stopped using that phrase the rest of the term.  The second guy said he felt ill and left the room. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I did not want to know about coliform bacteria just as much as I did not want to think about the bag of assholes, thank you very much.
