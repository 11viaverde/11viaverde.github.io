      the big thing about King is that he's solid at starting a book, but bad at finishing them off. if you've read many of his prefaces you'll know the guy takes  <em>pride</em>  in never knowing what the plot's going to be like when he starts a book. hundred percent, some people are able to pull that off and write a solid and consistent piece, but not King. especially in the case of Insomnia and the Dark Tower series, he gets so mad caught up in the narrative style he's famous for (i.e. take song lyrics and make them have Connotations) that by the end of the story he's standing there wondering where he was headed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
so at that point he starts writing it as high fantasy and maybe advertises Dark Tower a little.

      I'll give you a synopsis of the trilogy that is Anne Rice's ( under the pseudonym A.N. Roquelaure)  <em>The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty</em> .  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>FIRST BOOK:</strong>  BDSM, rape and severe stockholm syndrome.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>SECOND BOOK:</strong>  Everything you ever wanted to know about the pleasures of anal stimulation, and more. For both the boys and the ladies.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>THIRD BOOK:</strong>  Anne Rice started getting bored and decided to throw some kinky persians in there, or something. Also, Beauty (one could theoretically refer to her as the "protagonist"), gets free but is all, "WHY ISN'T ANYONE HITTING ME WHILE CALLING ME A BITCH AND RAPING MY BUTT?" while her poor parents try to find her a suitable husband. Eventually some dude that was another slave or whatever comes by and offers to be her "master" and she creams herself.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
All of these were read by the time I was 15 years old.

      Basically. You'd think having your ass be used for something other than a sperm container would be a positive, but that young woman pitches a shitfit when her parents get her with a guy that... well, maybe not respects her as a person but doesn't greet her with a good hard dicking.  <br/>

In short: Verbatim, no. In essence: Yes.

      Most of my later high school years were spent lending that trilogy to everyone I was on a first name basis with. It was also read aloud at birthday parties (assuming the parents were not present).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd read just because it's by far the most offensive book to catholic grandmothers around the world.

      I like Stephen King, mostly his short stories.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said, I can never bring myself to actually even rent Cell from the library.  <br/> 
The kicker is in the author bio in the back it says "Stephen King lives blah blah blah.. He does not own a cell phone." <br/>

I hesitiate, bite my lip, and put it back on the shelf.

      Cell didn't suck, despite being really recent. <br/>

I loved the Dark Tower, but my favorite King book is still the Stand.  "It" had a lot of very good parts and some not-so-good parts.

      I hold a large grudge against that movie, because I had to piss like a racehorse by the end of it, and all I could think was 'I sat through this for three hours, there is no way in Hell I'm getting up now!' <br/> 
 <br/> 
As you can guess, I became increasingly more angry each time it seemed like it was going to end and DIDN'T. Fuck.

      Well I mean man you have got to be fair.  The first two barely had endings and so he was basically ending an eleven hour movie which takes some thought, you know?  At least he did a Cool Thing or Two in those movies.

      I disagree. How the hell does that look after an epic, 9-hour (movie time) quest to destroy a ring that can enslave the world? People who had not read the book would think that PJ had heated up some marijuana. <br/>
