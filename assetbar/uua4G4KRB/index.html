      I am cursed with the German forehead, or German hairline, wherein it has always looked like I've got a receding hairline.  I'm trying to find the technical description or a picture of this, to no avail, so just take my word for it - it sucks.  My sisters have it too, but at least they have straight hair and can cover it up.  No, mine is annoyingly curly, giving it prominence.  But at least I have baby pictures of me with the same hairline to back up the fact that I'm not going bald.  Shaving my head only brings up more comments. <br/>

Meanwhile, the main picture of the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144932/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairline">Wikipedia article for forehead</a>  made me laugh.

      I have actually always seen Ray as bald. This is largely because Ray reminds me of my friend Mahmud, who was slightly overweight and had the same glasses along with pretty much the same outlook on life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mahmud was the son of a Turkish senator who was over here to "study." Let me explain why he is like Ray. <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. Mahmud once insisted on going to dinner somewhere really, really nice. When I said I couldn't afford it, he said he'd pay for it. Then when I said I didn't have a sportscoat or anything, he just went out and  <em>bought me a sportscoat.</em>  Because he was  <em>bored.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. He lost several phones because he would tend to drop them in his cup holder in the car, forgetting that the cupholder had a Big Gulp filled with Red Bull and vodka. Each time he managed to finagle the cell phone companies into giving him a free one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. He once drove all the way to a friend's house and walked in to say hello, forgetting every step of the way that he was not wearing pants. <br/> 
 <br/> 
4. He earnestly believed that cops here would happily accept bribes. This was probably more of a cultural thing, though.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
5. Any time he wanted to go to a club they would escort him to the front of the line as he would usually drop several thousand bucks there a night. Enough to both get a slob like me in and allow us to smoke, regardless of Austin's stringent anti-smoking laws.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
He went back to Turkey about two years ago. Everyone misses the hell out of him.

      There was one other dude I knew who was even richer and freer with his cash, but my acquaintance with him was pretty peripheral. He still didn't have much of a problem getting me into the VIP sections at clubs. <br/>

      I also feel the need to relate this humorous anecdote to you all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One night me and two buddies were drinkin' with Mahmud (the drink of the day was Raki - watch the  <em>fuck</em>  out for that shit) when our buddy Dave showed up. Drunk. He had driven himself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A few hours later we look up and somewhere in our anise-soaked brains we realize Dave is gone. So we asked Mahmud. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Oh, Dave left," he said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We stared at him.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"You let him drive away?" we asked. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Yeah," he said, and a slight look of discomfort came into his face. "It was sort of weird. We went down to his car, and then he threw up on the back of his car, and then he got in and backed into another car, and then he drove away." <br/> 
 <br/> 
There was a deafening silence. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mahmud drew something in the carpet with his toe. "I guess I should have stopped him, huh?" he said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Good times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
(Dave got home okay. Though he can't remember it.)

      The Mustang was a piece of crap for far longer than it was good, so if you think about it, that's actually what it should look like.  Now, it looks like what someone would drive to a Happy Days convention.

      Bands with big hair were the source of bad 80's music.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Men with bad hair designed the 80's version of the Mustang. (1)   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Men with ostentatious hair and oversized sunglasses designed the bad clothing of the 80's. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thus, hair was the root of all badness in those dark days, although the creative crimes of the hair were aided and abetted by sunglasses, especially those worn at night. <br/>

Hardcore was technically invented in '78 or '79, mostly thanks to early Black Flag and Discharge (who pioneered the now-generic d-beat). And you seem to be neglecting a ton of the bands that made the (non-pop) 80's music culture great: Government Issue, Siege, Septic Death, Larm... <em>jesus christ stop me now i have gone too far</em>

      When faced with an untimely arousal at Gramma's one must remain seated to avoid family shame, feigning interest in whatever is at hand.  The Reader's Digest Large Type Edition, which Gram has on account of her ancient fading corneas, is but one such means of concealment.  Others include endless games of Hearts, hour after hour of Gramma's stories on the afternoon TV or, god help you, making a potholder in the shape of an owl.

      I popped my first boner ever at grandma's house, BECAUSE I was reading the Norwegian equivalent of Reader's Digest (the European versions are a bit saucier). <br/>

      It was EXACTLY like that, only that the saucier content was called 'The Blue Pages' (read it like Barry White would, and say "tha' bluuue pagesss..."). <br/> 
I really wish some fellow Norwegians will back me up here.  <br/> 
It was also quite astonishing to read the articles of 'Norsk Ukeblad', 'Allers' and 'Hjemmet' for the first time  <br/>

      Once I popped like a thousand boners at grandma's house to the sound of a million screeching guitars, and then her head exploded, but it was OK because she was a pirate.  It was totally sweet, but also melancholy because it reminded me of a girl who was killed by pirates.  She was a ninja.

      I believe it has its roots in Biblical times, as part of taking a vow.  Paul  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144932/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=51&amp;chapter=18&amp;verse=18&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse">shaved his head</a>  as part of a vow, and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009144932/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2021:24">instructed other to do the same upon making a vow.</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, when in mourning, people would rip their hair out in clumps, along with their beards, and dressing in sackcloth and ashes and wailing.  If ever you go to a Jewish Orthodox funeral, you'll see what I mean.  Intense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, hair and the cutting of it had significant meaning.  It was then adapted into monasticism.

      I feel sorry in a way for men with hair.  Myself, I was an angry, bitter man from 22-26, when I was fighting an unwinnable battle against hair loss.  Which, when you think about it, is just your own manifestation of entropy.  Over the last few years, I embraced the inner bald man.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
My little brother achieved inner piece at 19.  He was totally bald at 18.  Coincidence?  I think not.

      I dunno about feline pattern balding, but I had a cat once who'd tear out clumps of hair on his flanks, till he had two bald streaks on his hind legs.  It was some kind of of nerve ending inlfammation, the vet guessed.

      Fair warning to everyone:  there are certain items that can rip your hair out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For instance, a Ford Landrover will rip your hair out if your head hits the ceiling.  My father and I learned that lesson the hard way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just to be safe, avoid tightly woven hats and pillow cases.  Wouldn't want to get anything pulled out.
