      After a nerve-wracking three minute coughing fit, during which I was alternately hovering ineffectually with a glass of water and sizing up which of the paintings I would lay claim to when we were divvying up her belongings, my grandmother looked at me and said 'Don't ever get old'. I said 'Don't worry. I'm a pretty heavy smoker and drinker, and I eat about a pound of good west country cheddar a week. I'll be lucky to reach forty.' She wasn't listening to me (she can barely hear a word anyone says anymore), she was just gazing grimly out the window at the snow covered fields and hills which stretched down to the grey sea.

      Since I have kids, I picture any question of that form as being asked by an enthusiastic Mom (and sometimes Dad) who's trying to make a baby laugh: "Who wants to be a pretty corpse?  You do!  Yes you do you cute, chubby little corpse!  Who's the cutest most precious little corpsey-worpsey around? Little Mr. Count Yumptious Kissyface von McCorpsypants, that's who!  [trails off into smoochy baby-talk noises]". <br/> 
 <br/> 
Parenthood: it destroys the brain. <br/>

P.S.-As proof of this, I spent a few seconds deciding what names went best with "McCorpsypants".

      except you sound like a six year old who just discovered that his dick is not something you wave about in front of family. "mushroom"? are you fucking serious? <br/>

head is fine. it's unambiguous, easy to say and understand, and isn't some kind of food related metaphor (this one is important).

      "Bell end" has a long and proud history in UK parlance.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Wow, just discovered it's a searchable term on wikipedia! <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glans penis <br/> 
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia <br/> 
  (Redirected from Bell end) <br/> 
The glans penis (or simply glans) is the sensitive bulbous structure at the distal end of the penis. It is also commonly referred to as the 'head of the penis'. Slang terms include "helmet", "nob" (or "knob"), and "bell end", and all refer to its distinctive shape.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's also a village in Worcestershire.

      This is the best thing I learned today: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>In 1996 there was controversy when AOL's obscenity filter (among others) refused to accept the name of the town due to its inclusion of the substring cunt, which the filter rejected as obscene. Some online forums such as Ultimate Guitar forums (which has recently been resolved) display the name as S****horpe, while Fark.com would display it as Scoonthorpe. This situation is known in the computing world as the Scunthorpe problem and is still an issue to Scunthorpe-based internet users.</em>

      The most I've ever spent on a drink was a double Hendricks on the rocks at a fancy rooftop bar overlooking the Mall in DC.  $32, pre-tip.  Luckily, though I was paying, it wasn't my money, ultimately (best left unsaid).   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I can get a fifth of Hendricks for that exact same price where I live.  But still, when in Rome.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also footed the bill ("at the time") for 5 other drinks for my compadres.  The bartender, an attractive girl, later found me and gave me a free drink; I think it was some kind of high-end tequila sunrise.  I gave it to one of the girls I was with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think that bartender was kind of into me, for more reasons than the free drink.  I probably should've done something with that.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Because I'm drinking some bourbon right now, I will speak of this time a few weeks ago when I was at a packed bar, and this girl I was standing next to at the time said we should combine our efforts and put in a joint drink order for whoever got a bartender's attention first.  Naturally, she won that battle (despite the fact that I was much taller than her), and put in the order.  For her kindness and acute use of her physical wiles, I bought her drink.  She told me to meet her at the bar in a little while so she could return the favor (she was about to get up on stage and sing the Nico part of "Femme Fatale" with the Velvet Underground temporary cover band playing that night).  I saw her waiting at the bar later, but didn't approach.  I think she noticed me noticing her.  It just seemed kind of cliched, you know? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Assetbar, tonight I'm using you like a hole carved in a tree on top of a hill, later to be covered with mud.  Tonight I am Tony Leung from  <em>In the Mood for Love</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think I might be in love with a married woman. <br/> 
 <br/> 
None of this might be considered actual.

      I have a feeling this is very bad form but I can't help posting this. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was asked the other week why Phillipe is staying with Teodor, rather than with his mother. From memory I can't recall a reason ever being given. I did have a cute idea though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As Phillipe is always five, I had this cute idea of Teodor and Phillipe meeting as children. Maybe even with Phillipe as the older, more mature friend originally. Subsequently, Teodor ages whilst Phillipe stays the same age, until eventually Teodor is of sufficient age to take Phillipe on as his ward. It's a bit like a backwards Flowers for Algernon thing.

Really though I think this is sort of a cute idea.  I'm pretty sure the reason Phillipe isn't with his mom is because she's in pretty deep with the mob, though.

      In the Dark Horse anthology "Worst Song Played on Ugliest Guitar," Teodor rents a room from the Onstads and Philippe arrives somewhat later, accidentally mailed by his mother either with or in place of a lamp, I don't remember and I don't have the book with me.  The airfare/shipping is too much to send him home, so his mother asks/Chris' wife suggests Philippe stay with them.  However this is most likely (I hope I'm using this correctly) retconned, as in the beginning I don't even think Philippe was meant to be a child, and like you and everyone else, I get the impression that he is Teodor's responsibility.

      Like I said, the retconning is all over the place.  I would assume some combination of all the possible stories is most likely.  But of course the artiste would probably say "Oh well it doesn't matter."  I hate when people do that.  Obviously it doesn't matter, but obsessive fans need continuity and for this imagined world to be as realistic as possible.  That always made me mad when Bill Watterson said it doesn't matter if Hobbes is real or not.  Clearly, but damn it I want to know if it's a magical world or an imaginative world, Hobbes ol' buddy.

      That was another thing that bothered me, but only when I first started reading (when I was like six) because I REALLY wanted to play Calvinball.  But then my cousin helped me understand that, truly, there are no rules.  So we played.  It's not as fun if you're not Calvin or Hobbes, though.  It ends quickly.

      Y'know, that is quite brilliant. And it makes one think about Phillipe's mom and how  <em>old</em>  she looks. She looks almost as old as Ray's mom. I never thought about how much Achewood would take into account Phillipe's lack of aging, even from the get-go.  <br/>

      Most kids my age only know how to do about three things on a computer (see: the previous strip), and most adults are thwarted by such as checking their email.  Accordingly when on a public computer whether you're reading webcomics, writing up forum posts, or drowning yourself in alternative pornography, people will have a lot of questions to ask you if they see you. <br/>

Fortunately, I don't care so much as a tad, so when I have free computer time at school I usually alternate between trolling Yahoo! answers and mashing the random button on Hark! a Vagrant.

I stand by (now defunct?)  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009031956/https://lucid-tv.com/index.html">Lucid TV</a>  as a quality comic.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009031956/https://www.asofterworld.com/">A Softer World</a> ,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009031956/https://www.qwantz.com/">Dinosaur Comics</a> , and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009031956/https://www.daisyowl.com/">Daisy Owl</a>  are also generally reliable depending on your taste. I'm fairly sure the guys who do Lucid TV and Daisy Owl post on assetbar or at least have in the past.  I wouldn't say any of these can compete with Achewood or Hark! but they're worth reading when you have the time.

      Also, there are a lot of pretty mediocre ones.  Don't get me wrong, I like PBF (it's one of the very few webcomics I've read), but on my 3rd or 4th time through the archive, I realized a lot of them don't hold up that well after the first read.  I guess you start to see the formula a little more clearly. <br/>

      I mean for fuck's sake it probably took MORE WORK to make a program that DIDN'T understand plus signs that it would have taken to just upload all of the keyboard keys! How much effort did these programmers expend on making sure that the plus sign couldn't be read or understood? Is there any possible reason to make that part of the program?

      I mean I have NEVER SEEN a computer program that wouldn't publish a plus sign. Even Zork would publish your plus signs, even if it didn't understand them. This is the most asinine chat program EVER INVENTED. Why not just use HTML? Who was the genius who decided he could improve on HTML by taking useful functions away from that program and replacing them with his own Mac-using feces?

      Last night I had a dream that Onstad had a viewing party in his living room. Many of you were there. He showed several strips that none of us had seen before, and we discussed the pros and cons of each as he listened attentively. We laughed a lot, and we had a grand old time. Also, at the end, he gave me a board game called "Yard Sale." You guys, how come dreams can't be real?

      Goddammit, I dropped a bowl onto my Achewood 8th anniversay pint glass this morning and chipped the fuck out of it. Fuck. <br/>

I guess I'll use it as a plant-pot for something that like waterlogged roots... <br/>

      I went through some of the more recent QC strips a few months ago. I've read bits of it in the past as well. My main feeling about the comic is that it has hell of extraneous detail. The art is incredibly finicky, without being very good, and the are always four or five punchlines in the last panel, none of which quite hit home. It's like trying to have sex while watching Die Hard: there's just too much going on and pretty soon you loose both your erection and your interest in the film, and you go off to smoke and read the Guardian in the kitchen. Your girlfriend is watching the film next door, but even though you can only see the back of her head you know she's really pissed off. When the film finishes she turns the television off and goes to bed without saying good night. You know you should follow her to the bedroom and try to make up, but fuck it, why should you make all the effort? So you just let yourself out and take the night bus home.

      Smarter people than we have tried without success to understand human social behaviour. <br/>

Ask them why they are behaving in this way; if they don't have an acceptable reason don't let them in again. <br/>

Could be difficult, of course, if it's their house too. In that case you would have to fall back on thallium in their coffee.

      P.S. Though I feel that a few more actual punchlines would help your work (not every comic artist needs them, but I think you do), I have to admit that I smirked in spite of myself at the rapist/saxophone tie pin situation.

      P.P.S. Regardless of how I feel about the actual work (not too good or bad), I must say that I'm hugely impressed that you seem to have come out unscathed after pitching your comic not once but  <em>twice</em>  here. In the assetbar of two years ago, you'd be dead in the ground by now. Maggots in your eyes and all. Maybe this is the long awaited era of peace.

      you know after reading achewood for so many years I think we have a subliminal link to Onstad and even if he doesn't come out and say what's going on, we have a sense of it, even if we can't articulate it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think Onstad is having crisis or something.  crisis of the Achewood. <br/> 
 <br/> 
look, it's going to happen sooner or later.  At some point.  This isn't Shultz who draw peanuts until day he dies.. <br/> 
 <br/> 
this is Achewood.  Achewood, if we realized it or not, was always a product of Onstad's state of mind, it was a work in progress, it was the progression of Onstad's exploration of the world combined with his exploration of Achewood.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
conclusion:  It can't go on forever.  It has to have crisis at some point <br/> 
 <br/> 
I bet you fifty dollar he's working on new characters already for something new, or, maybe he's just mired in writer's block of some sort. <br/> 
 <br/> 
either way, Achewood , I think we have to admit, is in crisis, and this crisis is only going to get worse. <br/>

      On the contrary, 2010 has seen a very strong upswing here. The delays are inevitable. All I look for is quality and this time last year was not nearly as promising. The best we can hope for is that he stays away from the over-long arcs this year. As long as he's a little more careful on that front, I don't care if it turns into a weekly comic.
