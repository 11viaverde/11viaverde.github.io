On the sidewalk, a cat is sliding on his back along the sidewalk while talking calmly to himself about paper or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just ahead of him is some sort of strange object - perhaps a large bug, or more likely, one of those fancy new skateboards the kids are using these days.

      If that's wasabe as in wasabi, then yes.  Peas that are hella spicy because they have been powdered with a variant of horseradish.

      I would at first be concerned for the cat, as he is obviously in danger of some sort.  After hearing him speak about Moby and paper stores, I would assume he is a dick, and not care that he is in danger.

      After waffling for several minutes on whether or not I wanted to quibble over the matter, I decided that I should point out that the walkway shown in the first panel is not the same as the walkway seen in the last panel. This is too bad, because it certainly would have been funnier your way.

      I have looked into this matter exhaustively, and it defnitely is not the same one. Note the width of the stairs, if not the bushes. Or perhaps the biggest clue, notice where the sidewalk tiles line up relative to the steps. <br/>

"I rose to discover a package from FedEx at my rear-facing bedroom door. You don't just walk up to my rear bedroom door %u2014 you have to go through a couple gates and get pretty intimate with my personal space. This FedEx driver, as far as I was concerned, had very nearly taken off her boots, gotten under the covers, and asked me to sign for the package across the expanse of her tough-nippled but silken-skinned breast."
