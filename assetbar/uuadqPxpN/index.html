      I made the same mistake on first reading. I thought it was like  <em>Twins</em> , where Danny DeVito learns that he is the product of all the shitty genes left over after the cream of the DNA was used to create  <em>ubermensch</em>  Arnold Schwarzenegger. I always felt kind of bad for DeVito about that. Can't have been a great role for the little fella's self-esteem.

      Cornelius and Teodor had been dropping hints to Beef about how he should row a boat out to the horizon for years to no avail.  You'd have thought that Beef would've begun to suspect after having found Nolan and Nightlife analyzing Venn diagrams of his various post-coital complaints in the pub that one night ("My neck is all dry" intersects with "I know I left that Chandler novel on the nightstand, dangit" an astonishing 48% of the time), but no.

      Is this sort of like the whole show was in the imagination of the little retarded boy with the snowglobe? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or, conversely, the episode of NewsRadio where it all turned out to be in the imagination of Mr. James, playing the little retarded boy with the snowglobe, who was inexplicably the son of Dave and Lisa even though he was clearly far older?

      I am replying to this post to say that Newsradio is an excellent show full of funny people, that Jon Lovitz blamed Andy Dick for Phil Hartman's death, and that I have a lust bomb in my pants prepared to blow up in Maura Tierney's face if she's EVER interested (and I'm saying even if it's 50 years from now and she's like 93... still). <br/>

Also I'm a little drunk so that explains those things I just said. They're all true though.

I also thought for a long time that I was destined to be a superhero. I would walk around my elementary school and feel superior. "What's that Eric? You got a Sega Genesis? Oh well I am a pre-super superhero. I'm going to be able to fly, bitch." I realized later that I was just better because I went to college and didn't end up doing heroin with hookers. Maybe not better, but more comfortable certainly.

Answer Two: A small county fair's balloon dart game. <br/>

For you see my friends, that is a common prize at Lincoln Daze, my former local fair.  It's a roach clip with a feather attached to it, and I had quite the collection as a kid. <br/>

      Are you saying that just because a movie is directed to children that it has no responsibility to objective truth?  That's a pretty awful position to take.  If anything, I'd want children's movies to be more scientifically accurate because of their impaired ability to the difference between science and fiction. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That having been said, there's no reason that the magic that shrunk the kids couldn't have also reduced the weight of the atoms constituting the kids.  If so, they should have pointed that out.

      This bothered me about Cloverfield as well. My nemesis and former Cosmic Asshole (a post he got from Sagan and passed to Dawkins) Stephen Jay Gould has a cool article about this. Basically everything is the right size for its design, and the bigger you get the less leeway you have. Bug's exoskeletons are not so much the problem as the fact they breathe through their skin. An animal's surface/volume ratio keeps shrinking as it grows (area is squared, volume is cubed) and it eventually doesn't have enough skin to breathe. Insects can much bigger than they are. Big animals (hippos, rhinos, elephants, bears, etc) all have generally the same body type because of the whole strength/volume stuff as well. <br/>

Okay, that's enough. Even though I'm agreeing with you you should still consider changing your avatar. It's a little too serious.

      Chubbies for pointing out that 'everything is the right size for its design' (which is kind of unavoidably true, otherwise we'd be seeing a lot of dead carcasses of unworkable creatures from Spore by the side of the road), BUT ... I don't know about bugs, but the main reason humans and other large mammals can't have exoskeletons has to do with the structural support you need to keep your internal organs from all sitting in a pool in your belly (which is not needed by smaller, lighter creatures).  You breath through a different organ known as 'the mouth'.

      Breathing is always a problem with outsize things. The Bugatti Veyron is a sports car with a 1000 hp engine. There are definite engineering problems for a car that needs to inhale 45,000 liters of air per minute.

      but imagine if the Bugatti Veyron was also a giant preying mantis, its internal organs would also be squashed in its trunk from the force of the acceleration.  This is why the optimal sportscar-mantis hybrid demands an adamantium skeleton as well as a gill-like apparatus on its neck for increased air intake.

      It's less the support issue, and more about growing.  They have to chuck most of their body every time they grow much, and getting from smallish egg to giant fucking mantis would require hundreds of moltings, which can only happen at a fixed frequency (time for the new exo to harden), so they would have to live like, a jillion years for this to work.  However, given the mechanical advantage of muscles on the inside, this mantis could rape whole skyscrapers.

      Also it's the fact that a muscle's strength increases with cross sectional area, but it's weight increases with volume. Guess which increases faster when you make something bigger. <br/>

      Hentai is fucking hilarious, there is nothing wrong with watching hentai so long as you are watching it with pants on and not doing any naughty touching.  The only time hentai becomes a problem is when you start to get turned on by it, it is only at this point where you become a sick fuck who is deservingly shunned by society.

      I would be careful about playing Square games for too long hec. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When we first got  <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>  and a PlayStation that long decade ago we forgot to purchase Memory Cards so we had to stave off playing until a trip to Best Buy could be made. But the allure of Materia was too strong and so I told myself I was going to play just a little bit to get a sense of the feel of the texture of the gameplay  but  <em>Final Fantasy</em>  is like Pringles* man once you start youuuuuu can't stop and so I played for eight hours straight until I  <em>got out of fucking Midgar</em> . It was well into the wee hours of dusk by then and my disapproving mother told me it was time to turn the game off and go to bed. She was not hearing my adolescent whinings but I was so dizzy and bewildered by the soft radiation from eight hours of TV screen that I convinced myself  <em>Maybe if I just take a mental picture really hard of where I was at I can use the electromagnetic waves from my brain and start from there tomorrow</em>  man it was worst concept conducted at shoddiest science fair. Needless to say when I woke the next morning, the progress of my journey had been lost to the winds of our constantly rotating world but I set out with newfound resolve to obtain the small piece of plastic needed to record my tales for the ages. <br/> 
 <br/> 
*Pringles are an American brand of potato chips, which in your country you refer to as crisps or maybe tallywackers or some other shitt.

      Oddly enough I had the same exact issue.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
We had rented a PSX for the first time and FFVII with it. We were unaware of memory cards at the time, so my resolve was to just leave the game running the entirety of my rental period.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It would have worked just fine if I hadn't put disc 3 in when it asked for disc 2. FMVs that should have been the meteor crater were showing scenes of the Golden Saucer and the weapon attack on Juno.  <br/>

Losing a huge amount of data due to lack of or shoddy memory card is pretty much one of my biggest fears. If someone broke into my bedroom in the night and threated to rape and kill me I'd be like, "Please, just take anything you want! ...But could you leave my memory card?"

      Dream-Ray feels the need to apologize for the fact of his existence when addressing a man of holy means. Ray-Of-The-Real-World would never do that. He'd be most likely talking mad benevolence on Roast Beef during the ceremony, perhaps annoying a few relatives on both sides, but all in all being a wacky good friend.  <br/>

One of the great things about achewood is that so many of the characters are not talking stereotypes, but rather have enough to be situationally-driven, much like real people are.

      I love how dream-world Ray dresses kind of like gay Pat, with a turtle-neck and vest. That seems to me like a great example of standard dream-logic; in your dream where your friend is doing something totally out of character, they are also in some ways like some other friend, or they get switched to be some other friend at some other point of the dream. I have a lot of dreams like that.  <br/>
