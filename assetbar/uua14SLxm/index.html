      The juxtaposition between this strip and the last is fantastic. It's like Onstad is saying to us, "Yeah, yeah, we'll have our sweet moments, but this strip is still about a bunch of raw and dirty dudes tearing it up on the deviant scene." Considering how he adamantly stated this was not a baby strip when he had a kid, I just assume it's true.

      Even you have to admit... a game that primarily revolves around kicking a ball around deserves the generic name "football" more than one that revolves primarily around picking things up and running with them... with the absolute minimum of foot-on-ball action.  <br/>

That'd be why I say "Rugby" and not "Rugby Football"....  and when I'm feeling particularly pretentious I'll say "Rugby Union" or "Rugby League". <br/>

      It sucks. Every time I want to show one of my favorite Achewoods to someone who isn't a regular reader, it falls completely flat because it's in the middle of an insane story sequence like this. Which as far as I'm concerned is proof that the strip is great, but it's still annoying. <br/>

Also, I just now noticed how weird Lyle's expressions and words in panels 2 and 3 actually are. First he seems sad that there's a football on the floor that hasn't been vomited on, then he's all pumped that he has discovered a way to remedy the situation.

      Dude, whatever. If the forum had come along at the time when Nice Pete was taking Phillipe to the ice cream parlor, people would've been flipping the fuck out. The same with GOF. THis was the first real-time response opportunity we've had for a big arc like the one we've just seen. People respond to the different emotions getting tapped every day. It's not unreasonable to think that fans of this strip (who, I might add, I usually picture as fairly intellectual) are above being adamant about what they want and how much they love what's going on in this universe.  <br/>

One point I will agree on: he had better say something about gay people soon, lest Retardo shrivel up like a tiny, flamboyant flower in a drought.

      Either you did not pick up on my sarcasm, or I am not getting yours.  'Cause your comment is phrased as though you oppose what I wrote (you even say "one point I will agree on"), but what you wrote agrees with what I wrote.  That is, if you meant "People should be able to post their honest reactions to Achewood here, positive or negative, however strong, without getting crap from the likes of you."  I add the proviso that they should not attack Onstad or one another personally, but not everyone agrees. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now I'm looking back at the guy who called me a tool, and I wonder if he also thought my comment was to be taken seriously.  I figured the whole dwelling-on-the-loss-of-ass-flesh would make it clear to most people that it was sarcastic.  Telling Onstad that his loyal fans want him to be boring should have gotten it across to 90% of readers.  Onstad's kid finding him, assless, on the dissection table should have gotten it over 95%, maybe even 97%.  Bringing in Retardo should have turned on the light even for such as would call me a tool.  But I obviously did not try hard enough.  Yes, I see the problem now.  I failed to use the appropriate emoticons. <br/>

      Lyle's and Téodor's lack of pupils always puts me in mind of Little Orphan Annie. This is slightly uncomfortable because neither character is a  <em>bit</em>  like Little Orphan Annie. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is an oddly graceful pose from Lyle in panel four. Does anyone with more money than sense (the "Ray" of Acheworld, if you will) want to have such a fountain made? No? Ok, then. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Finally: Didn't Lyle just roll the football about its long axis? It's hard to see how that qualifies as a "spiral," unless he imparted some motion along that axis as well. It's not easy to tell with the perspective and all. Perhaps I am thinking this through too carefully.

 <br/> 
That's a nice little curve at the beginning and end of Lyle's "YARRRRRP!". It adds yet more odd grace to the oddly graceful pose. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And finally finally: 2nd & 9 with Lyle in possession. I think he'll switch to a passing game for the next play, but I don't know all that much about football. Who knows, maybe he has enough whiskey in him to barf the ball a little farther down the field. <br/>

      actaully, it is suprisingly difficult to have a football spiral via vomit.  Since a football is such an oddly oblong shape, you would have to place your vomit on the direct center of the football, otherwise it would wobble around in a circle.

      While I am glad that Lyle's vomiting was so hard that it made a football roll 3 feet, I was kinda hoping that the prospect of it was just ALT TEXT trying to lighten up a syrupy (but awesome) moment. I didn't think it would actually happen. The mental image of the act conjured up was enough. Still: "That doesn't just happen by not caring".. BRILLIANT.

      Since no one asked, what I mean is akin to when Roast Beef asked Phillipe: "Roast Beef: Remember when Todd gor put in the newspaper for yellin' at his girlfriend so loud that he had to go to the hospital". <br/>

 <br/> 
You could show Todd actually doing it, but it would never be as good as the suggestion of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, i fully agree with the assertion that Teodor's spewing abilities would lack the caring and warmth of Lyle's.

      While it's awesome that yesterday's alt-text was delivered upon, there's not enough attention being given to Lyle's "Oh HELL yes!" in panel three. It's a subtle indicator that, though we haven't seen this behaviour before, the desire to move a football by vomiting on it is an integral part of Lyle's general character. Furthermore, it (accompanied by his following reaction) shows that it's something he's done before but never to such success*. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So what would simply be a humorously-gross situation to cut an extended significant romantic plot is, through panel three, transformed into an equally-significant moment for Lyle's character.  <br/>

      I agree with tinhand, and I'm concerned we forced Onstad into doing this strip.  But even if we did, he pulled it off with style and aplomb.  Or, as much style and aplomb as there can be with a vomit-propelled football. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But did anyone else think he wouldn't have to vomit AT the ball, and he would just vomit so hard the football moved on its own.

      I'm pretty sure he's stated that he avoids forums, etc. because of how they influence the strip. Which is probably good. But at least he gives you a witty reply if you e-mail him!
