      If I were a Springsteen fan, I'd be pretty fuckin' furious about how many people completely missed the point of that song. The idea that Reagan co-opted a song containing the lyric "Sent me off to a foreign land / To go and fight the yellow man" as an un-ironic, flag-waving, all-American anthem is just too ridiculous for words. <br/>

      I suspect most readers, being your age and younger, don't remember Reagan's attempts to co-opt that song. Which is probably just as well. If you're going to consistently elect Presidents who have obvious cases of medical dementia, there's really no reason to ponder their poetic interpretations very long.

      True Story - I once heard a guy on local radio dedicating that to a girlfriend he'd just spent an amazing weekend with. To this day I still wonder if he was slyly breaking up with her on the radio, or he was an idiot and did not know what the song was about.

      They made us memorize and sing that song at our fifth-grade graduation. Yes, it is a little ironic because of the title. But the actual lyrics of the song are sort of neutrally melancholic, not bitter in the way the title implies. In fact, the title itself is meant to be ironic, given the lyrics. Like the singer's trying to make a clean break, but he's more regretful than he thought he was. Anyway, maybe I'll go put my close reading of Green Day onto my Livejournal.

      Well, it's rare for me to find ways to practice it, and there are a bunch of people on here who speak it, so it works out for me. On a side note, I didn't log on in two weeks and all of a sudden I have about 60 more lames than I did, and about 20 snippy replies from you. Did you go through the archives just to spite me? If it stoops to that level, sir, I just don't know what to do as I work 12 hour days and that doesn't leave me enough time to come up with witty responses.

      OK. Here's how it worked out, if you really want to know.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I never used to check lames. I found out how and did it a few times out of curiosity. Then I started to feel stupid about it because it was a waste of time and it was distracting me from the real reason I was here, which was the great comic above and the occasional opportunity at witty banter.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fast-forward about two months. I hadn't been logging on regularly for about a month (you're not the only full-time worker here, sister), so I thought I'd make another trip through the archives. When I did, I noticed a pattern. I noticed that I barely had a single comment that didn't have at least one lame. Now, I sure as hell have made some lame-ass comments here, and people have responded accordingly. That is the way it should be. But not everything I've said here is lame. I saw that even on the rare occasion (especially rare early on) that I said something that wasn't outlandishly lame, there was still that one mark no matter what. I got curious. I checked a few. Found a pattern. Checked some more. And I'll be god damned if your name didn't show up at least a good 85% of the time.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, I'm not gonna lie - that made me feel weird and bad for some stupid reason. I think it mainly had to do with the fact that you and I, to my recollection, had never had anything to do with one another, yet you seemed to be going out of your way to pounce on even the most trivial and inoffensive of my posts. As I said, I was already on my way back through the archives, so armed with this new and terrible knowledge I did what any person worth his salt would - I retaliated. I didn't waste time hunting you down, but when I happened to see you, I knew what to do. Sometimes I was drunk and made little bitchy comments (see above). As lame as it was, I felt just in my actions. There was a level, and yes, I stooped to it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm over it now. I got my limp-wristed little revenge and I harbor no malice. We can end this here or each of us can just flick the other in the ear whenever the other isn't looking for the rest of time.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just thought an explanation was in order.

      I didn't start using the lame button until I had gotten a good amount of the way through the archives (maybe a year or so?), but decided to write reply comments instead. In fact, I feel kind of guilty when I leave a negative reply and a lame at the same time and tend to avoid it. I don't lame someone's comment if I don't find it to be so. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I find immature jabs and windy explinations kind of lame, and it seems that you do a lot of those. I'm sure your responses are just your type of humor, but this is the internet and you can misinterpret humor easily. I wasn't out for blood. You just tend to leave a lot of comments that I find to be either mean or lame.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I don't intend to stop using the lame button for what it is meant for, though I can promise I wont use it to purposefully be an asshole to you. If I find your comments lame, I will act on it, and if I find them to be awesome (and I'm pretty sure I did a few times), I will give them a chubby. This was never a matter, for me, of being a jerk to you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So.. hopefully this will be the only verbose comment I ever leave that does not pertain to the actual comic. I already mentioned I don't like them much, but you put in the effort so I figured I better respond likewise.

      It's rarer in countries that are not china.  Even in countries that have chinese speakers, there is a good chance that they would live in an area with a concentration of people that speak their language, and those areas are not EVERYWHERE.  Just saying.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, there are Chinese dialects that are sometimes pretty different from each other and hard to understand if the listener is not familiar with them.  So, if one only knew a single dialect, he/she would be able to speak to less than 1/4 of the earth's population like you have stated.
