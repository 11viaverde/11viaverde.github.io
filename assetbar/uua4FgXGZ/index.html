      I'm not sure there's any way to do Watchmen justice in movie form. One of Watchmen's main deals is the fragmenting of time and perspective, and I just don't know how they're going to handle that in a movie unless they make it all postmodern-y, which wouldn't draw an audience. <br/>

      My biggest problem with it so far is how young and sleek everyone looks. For me it's already read like a band going through a midlife crisis and trying to regroup. <br/> 
Rorschach is the unsuccessful solo artist slaving away in obscurity in the same old style. <br/> 
Ozymandias is the Robbie Williams figure. <br/> 
Nite Owl's the bassist who left for a lucrative job in a bank. Who still goes to his basement to rock out. <br/> 
Silk Spectre II is the former roadie/dancer whose feeling slightly ashamed of her time with the band. Though she still loves that bassist. <br/> 
Manhattan is the record company and the real power behind the band. Though now he's moved on and doesn't even want to know.

      My favorite bad movie! "The penis is the enemy because it shoots life. The gun is our friend because it shoots death!"  Bubba, you just can't BUY dialog like that nowadays. For those of you who haven't had the pleasure, imagine that Ed Wood got $10 million dollars, all of Ireland, Sean Connery, Charlotte Rampling, a bevy of topless starlets and unlimited acid and weed. THAT's Zardoz. Oh, baby, the train wreck of train wrecks.

      Good guesses all, but mostly wrong (half-credit for "circumstances").  The taquitos should have given you Southwestern U.S., and the artificiality of the microwave implies California.  Kid Rock suggests Riverside, Barstow, or the San Joaquin Valley, and wife beaters, although abundant in Riverside, are more typical of the agrarian Valley and Barstow.  The hint of baked body odor applies to both Bakersfield and Barstow, but (this is the tricky part) since I have a computer at all it's gotta be Bakersfield.  <br/>

Now, if you figure out my final hint, you can come visit me: My keyboard has the faintest whisper of burning tire and lemons.

      Having grown up on Dave Barry, most of my time is spent pointing out various non sequitirs in conversations that would make hilarious band names. Memorable ones include "Soviet Dick," "Frank Capra's Shetland Pony Assholes," "Stinky Peete and the Chuckwagon Faggots," and "Fred Thompson's Horrible Genitals."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now I can't remember any of the conversations from which those splinters of stupidity arose. Just useless band names. When I get old and senile and start spouting phrases from my youth, everyone at Luby's is going to be really disturbed by the old man shouting "CHUCKWAGON FAGGOTS! CHUCKWAGON FAGGOTS!"

      I was just thinking recently about how we British keep quiet when Onstad unleashes his so-called "Anglophilia", and the people on Assetbar go all "woo hahahahaha British people/food/celebrities suck!!", and wondering whether we kept quiet for any of the following reasons (and this is a non-exhaustive list): <br/> 
 <br/> 
-- we silently agree with the American comments (I couldn't help but laugh when I read one comment about England's chavish population and its incapacity to formulate any form of intelligent riposte) <br/> 
-- we know better than to join a debate on the INTERNET, ye home of AOL (remind me, does the A stand for... Anglophiles?) <br/> 
-- we enjoy and laugh at the ragging they give us, safe in the knowledge of own superiority <br/> 
-- we don't know what to say so we just keep mum and hope the next Showbiz strip comes soon to deflect attention from us <br/> 
 <br/> 
there are many other reasons but those are the ones that came to mind. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, why am I so exhausted that I cannot get up, but the moment I call and cancel my appointments for the morning, I am on the internet talking rubbish instead of sleeping. WRRRRRY.

      American mocking of anglophilia is not the same as mocking the English. (Let's leave the Scots and Welsh out of this, they're entirely innocent.)  There is something more than faintly ridiculous about anyone in the US carrying on about and living in a world that is a fantasy of Victorian civility and mores... and this Victorian past was, by most accounts, a hellish nightmare of toil and disease.  American anglophilia has nothing to do with England or the English, and everything to do with our collective inability to grasp the horrible injustices of our own past or present.  Just my 2 cents.

      I find it kind of charming that his insights into Britishness are filtered through such a north American lens. <br/>

He pulls off Cornelius's ex-pat thing pretty well, though. Or at least I assume that's his intent. Makes me wonder whether the US readers take that into account and don't just think of him as a wholly British character.

      He isn't an ex-pat at all.  He's a re-pat.  Brit Ex-pats, at least those in California, tend to be the happy hyperagressive car salesmen type, pleased as hell that everyone likes them for their charming accent.  They're happy about the good life and tend to  act more American than apple pie.  They deliberately keep the accent since it's a great meal ticket and are secretly afraid that we might wise up and realize that they're really a son of the working class.

      If we're talking the actual definition of the term... Then yeah, he's an ex-pat. I think the difference between Cornelius and your experience with most British ex-pats is that Corneilus isn't a money-grubbing cunt. However he  <em>is</em>  Americanised in quite a lot of ways. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've got to admit, Englishness is a really fun thing to play up in the US. Especially when female shop-assistants ask you to say specific words for them and then give you money off of stuff.

      I think there are enough places Americans and non-Americans alike can go to make fun of America.  Which is okay, sure.  Making fun of Britain though, it's a bit rarer a commodity for most US citizens, at least.  Humor aimed at the segments of America deemed backwards is pervasive, all over the place.  It's refreshing to see another group get a little sassin'.  Honestly, I think it's very cheap to make a joke about...the Southern United States or something.  Just because I hear them all the time.  I never hear, outside of Achewood, jokes aimed at Britain.  It's probably different perspectives though.  America-bashing jokes are old hat in America; British-bashing jokes are probably old hat in Britain. <br/> <br/> <br/> also i mean seriously  <em>blood pudding</em>

      I don't know who to reply to so I'll reply to myself... all I meant was, I was wondering, with amusement, as to why us British always keep very quiet during these strips... I was more probing for British comments than anything else. I'm not offended by the Brit-bashing, go for it. I'm hybrid British-French and I treat both my countries with equal disdain -- and of course get served for it on a regular basis.

      I believe your unconscious attributed an absent "E" (It would have been nice if it were an "A" to keep my alliteration going, but  <strong>a</strong> las.)  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I think you can claim that credit, my friend. Perhaps you would like to exchange it at the assetbar gift shop for an oversize novelty comb? Or you can save up and go for the portable RCA black and white TV, for your kitchen table or boat, maybe.

      I can understand that. I probably would have stopped after the first one or two red ones, but good on you for keeping at it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, there's no excuse for eating the black ones. They clearly have all the hallmarks of black licorice (if you ignore that they're made of plastic and came with a tiny checker board) and there's no reason to put tooth to that, even experimentally.

      I was going to say that it's an interesting theory, but they have entirely different last names (Cornelius Bear, and Teodor Orezscu) and Teodor is of Eastern European/Jewish origin. So barring an extremely convoluted story arc that explains all these things, not bloody likely. <br/>

Besides, they appear to be different kinds of bear.
