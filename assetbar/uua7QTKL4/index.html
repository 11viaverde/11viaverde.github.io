      assetbar, I'm pretty sure, is an achewood easter egg where if you manage to wade through restatements of previous (or current) punchlines, snarky one-liners, endless debates of whether something should be chubbied versus lamed, the alt-text, and potentially a boss fight against asherdan, you get to read an amusing story next to a tiny picture of stephen fry. <br/> 
 <br/> 
in all honesty after I created an account I read the things that were filtered out because they were lamed too much and realized there was too much social shit to deal with in my life and I wasn't ready to worry whether or not an internet community will like me. I like to read the assets because sometimes people can be funny or insightful but oftentimes it has the least vocal people determining that other people will not enjoy someone's entirely benign comment because it is not "omg I totally say this all the time". <br/>

in short: "Nonsense!" && I totally said "What the fuck, man?!" today and it was amazing.

      The strip is as well written as always, but I'd say your point is well taken. Onstad could just as easily have picked out some truly bad webcomics a la  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100906064659/https://badwebcomics.blogspot.com/">John Solomon</a> , but for whatever reason chose to just take a randomizer and assume the worst instead of doing a bit of cursory research to make sure he was picking deserving subjects of his rapier of wit. Onstad did sort of drop the ball on this one a bit by generically pulling webcomics regardless of their content and skewering them.  Not everyone can get everything right, though, so I don't think this is a particularly great injustice. I think the classic line from the last panel makes up for the unusual lack of direction. At least a four (to me)... <br/> 
 <br/> 
But  <strong>please</strong>  note that you are perfectly obliged to write your opinions on Assetbar. This isn't exactly the Roman Pantheon, here. Doesn't need to be Sycophant City. I'd say it's better to see a post or two of honest critique than yet another instance of Soticoto being a douche or the nameless hordes grinning wildly about how they have apparently fallen upon the remarkable mental capacity required to incorporate Onstad's lines into their common vernacular.  <br/>

      But shouldn't we also consider the fact that it's maybe not the specific comics that he's mocking, but the attitude that some of these web comic cartoonists have? I.e., their complete pomposity over something that they spent slaving over in MS Paint, making them think they have something that qualifies as "art". That's what I got from it, at least.

      The art's not bad at all, I'll give Naylor that. But the fact that the too-cool sulky male cat is the author's blatant mouthpiece plus the strip's fucking politics AND all the sisterfuckin' is just real bad times as far as I'm concerned.
