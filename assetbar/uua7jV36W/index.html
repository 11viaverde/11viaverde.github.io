      My first real introduction to Africa as a palaeontology student was looking at maps of the coastline and seeing huge swathes marked "Restricted Zone - Diamond Mining". And then reading the local newspapers and hearing about mining operations being shut down by DeBeers, because the price was dropping so they needed to artifically restrict the supply again to give it a bump. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then about how generous they are for sharing their profits with the government, instead of taking it at gunpoint like in the bad ole days. Sharing things they never had a right to in the first place. Real class act, DeBeers is.

      That is just how I feel about diamonds!  The ex-wife didn't see it the same way.  Lucky for her we had no money, or she'd have gotten some mineralized rodent waste, just like Beef says. <br/>

For his sake, I hope he's not really building that little flashy thing.  That's worse than a kidney stone to a woman who wants diamonds. <br/>

I'm not sure Molly would care about diamonds, though.  She gets really happy when Roast Beef brings her Chinese food unexpectedly.  Lowered expectations, maybe.

      Frankly, I'm surprised that Beef's circuit is so bulky.  Looks like he's got a half-Watt resistor on there, as well as a small capacitor of some kind.  The controller he's using looks fairly small, at least - but you'd think he'd have gotten a microcontroller that wouldn't need external components for its oscillator...

      I don't think Molly is "Exactly the type to care about diamonds" but you have to be really careful about this kind of shit with women.  They're a tricky creature, especially when it comes to marriage proposals and weddings. You don't know what they've been planning/fantasizing about on this subject for the the previous 2-3 decades. Minefields everywhere on this.   <br/>
