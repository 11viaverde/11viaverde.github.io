      Why you using a laptop anyway? <br/> 
Those things designed for people who go outside  <strong>willingly</strong> . People who have  <em>friends</em> .  <br/> 
Basically just not the sort of people a computer would want to be intimate with.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Besides... who wants friends? You think you're getting along so well, and then they dump you in an incinerator to open a door.

      Apple computers do a lot of things well, but they'll never do as much as PCs do, because they're not designed to be flexible.  On a PC, you can do anything if you're willing to spend a little time and effor to make it work.  On a mac, they pretty much have to bundle everything you'd ever need, because there's fuck all else you can do with it.

      I learned pro tools in college and was not impressed due to it's limited functionality. It's like they didn't even care. All Mac stuff is like they don't care what you want. I don't like being told I can only use something one way. I didn't like how they crashed all the time when trying to render stuff in Final Cut Pro or Adobe After Effects. I didn't like how slow they rendered anything compared to their cheaper PC contemporaries. I didn't like Macwhores screaming to high heaven how awesome the Mac was even though it was not awesome.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
No, they weren't useless, they just better at being artwork than being computers.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I did like that if you had a PC, you could put Windows 2000 on it, and it always worked. I still use that computer. I am typing on it now. It never fucks up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My first computer was a 1987 Mac SE. It was a delight to use. Did some crazy hypercard scripts and shufflepuck on that bitch.

      PCs are for people who know how to use computers  <em>and have a tendency to imagine worst-case scenarios</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Macs do break less often than PCs, but when a PC breaks you're a lot less screwed than when a Mac breaks, because it's so much easier to fix the problem (if you know stuff about computers). <br/>

      The only down side is that the ExplodingDog skin covers up Beef's quote. I guess I could just shout it at people whenever I take my iPod out, but that kind of impacts on the subtlety.

      My mac is stable, seems to manage memory much better, lets me enjoy the internets with much more wild, carefree abandon. It doesn't play DVDs after the latest update. <br/>

My Windows computer (which I am typing this on, because my laptop is in the other damn room) is good for playing games on, and scares the shit out of me to enjoy the internet with. It doesn't let me charge my phone through the USB port. <br/>

      I actually hate macs because I HAVE to use them frequently.  My school stocks its lab with brand new imacs, only.  I've logged at least eighty hours on the sexiest computers Apple can throw at our tech guy, and I hate them.  The OS is virtually unusable, and a thousand things I assume a PC will have are missing.  I used to feel like a master saxophone player who'd been reduced to busking with a three-dollar accordion.  Thank god I finally got a laptop.

      Macs aren't irrelevant, actually. I, being a PC guy all my life, had to figure out how to use macs in college. See in the design industry macs are the standard, and now that I have both mac and pc, I see the uses for both. <br/>
