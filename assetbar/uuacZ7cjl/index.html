      Do you actually believe this?  Be honest, please.  IT is definitely a real phenomenon.  You can give a bunch of people the same stereogram and ask them--without allowing them to communicate--to write down what they see, and most of the ones who know how to figure it out--assuming the picture isn't too complicated--will write down the same answer.  I promise you this. <br/>

      Just because you are not able to do something, that doesn't mean that everybody else is crazy and you are sane.  Once you see it, it is self-evident it isn't apophenia.  AT first, it is a mystery how it works, but if you think about how the eyes work in conjunction with one another to see depth, it makes sense. <br/> 
Do you ever just leave your eyes unfocused?  Do you ever hold two pencils up and let your eyes focus past them so that they become three pencils instead?  That is exactly what you're doing here.  [IMGS OFF] <br/>

      Your explanation is really good, but I've never been able to do this and I still can't. I used to believe folks were making it up, much like Belgand does.

      Haha. <br/> 
I recommend just getting used to unfocusing your eyes.  Make it less of an automatic thing.  Notice how only things a certain distance from your eyes are in single-vision; everything else is in double vision to some extent, and the closer to your eyes it is, the more pronounced and obvious it is.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you practice enough, you can unfocus your eyes on will, like a muscle. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or, just cross your eyes when you look at these things.  This is easier for beginners, only it's inverse, and blurry.  And your brain may not be able to undwrstand what it's looking at just yet, but it will recognize differences in depth.  With practice, it will percieve the image instantly.

      I actually know exactly how they work and, in theory, how to get them to work. I'm kind of distressed that SJE was so gullible to think I really believed it a conspiracy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Interestingly I saw  <em>Coraline</em>  (pretty good, not great, I'd say see it in theaters to see the 3D while you can, but don't worry if you miss it) the other night and I had trouble with the 3D. Oh, it worked most of the time, but fast motion would blur it out too much and sometimes I had trouble and would basically see the depth,but flatten it out a bit. <br/>

So it might honestly be that it really is an issue with my eyes more than anything. I always passed my eye tests as a kid though....

I'm thinking that possibly you could be colorblind.  I think they test for that for children though.  Either this, or you have a lazy eye, or you have only one eye.  These are the only things I can think of that could cause you to not see it sensory-wise.  The problem with most people though is simply the perception; that is, the brain.

      None of the above. I see colors fine (a friend of mine is colorblind, I know the difference), my eyes are definitely not lazy, and last time I checked I had all three of them. <br/>

It's definitely the brain. I'm usually rather good at being able to ignore optical illusions if I choose to. Not always, but many times I can see things two ways at once. <br/>

      Yeah, I believe it has absolutely nothing to do with right brain/left brain sort of things, but I find it an utterly compelling and interesting illusion. <br/>

It is so annoying and weird when you do make the switch and then can't seem to get it to go back. I mean, just a second ago you couldn't fathom how it could ever go the other way and now you're locked into a new direction. <br/>

      I had this exact same problem with Coraline, and I can't see Magic Eye pictures either. I can, however, read highway signs from alarmingly far distances.  <br/>

      Oddly I felt it looked a lot more like 3D than stop-motion. Especially compared to  <em>Nightmare Before Christmas</em> . I think it was the character design. In this things tended to be a lot more grounded and the models were typically much smoother. It was odd. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was thinking that it, in a way, makes sense to do stop-motion in 3D as we're looking at a physical object and this could better represent its 3D nature compared to 2D animation.

I highly recommend putting the glasses on either upside down or backwards. One way (I don't remember which) does stuff like make someone standing in front of a wall look like they're farther away than the wall is. It's a very strange effect. Basically your eyes and brain have a fight.

      It just depend if you go cross-eyed or walleyed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If we mark 2 objects A and B, then cross-eyed = left eye sees B, right eye sees A.  Wall-eyed is the opposite.  Due to the way depth perception works, the "3d" effect will be reversed depending which you do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To get cross-eyed, just put your finger (or something) between your face and the screen, and focus on it.  Then go back to the screen without re-aiming your eyes, and if it's a pattern like this one you can get it clear without uncrossing your eyes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, to do it walleyed, go close to the screen (maybe 10-20 cm) and unfocus from it, maybe blink a few times.  Your eyes should uncross, and if you're focussed on this kind of pattern you can see it the other way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At least that's what works for me.

sje, are you familiar with "stereo images"? Click  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100408120829/https://artbytheo.deviantart.com/art/Stand-Stereo-107295477">https://artbytheo.deviantart.com/art/Stand-Stereo-107295477</a>  for a pretty good one (you'll need to click the image for full-size view). Basically you kind of cross your eyes until the images are aligned and then unfocus, and the two images become one and it looks 3-D and really cool. <br/>

      There doesn't need to be an illusion. Look at contemporary physics. Reality is far more weird and terrifying than anything we could ever hope to invent. <br/>

If you're not filled with existential dread and true, fear-inspiring awe every moment of your life then you're not comprehending everything yet.

      Generally true, but not in this case, for once. I know they're not a conspiracy, but I still can't see the damn things. I was thinking, and I have no reason why, that perhaps a period of time that will not be discussed for it would make me upset having passed would cause me to be able to do them in a way I couldn't at the time they were popular. It has not been so. <br/>

      I think I hate you even more now. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are seeing that movie for all the wrong reasons. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Superbad</em>  was fun, but in the tradition of a long line of 80s teen comedies. The other Judd Apatow stuff? Horrible! Some of the worst movies ever made! It's mainly his message though. Look at both 30 Year-Old Virgin (mildly amusing in places) and the execrable Knocked Up and you see the same viewpoint being espoused: guys need to stop doing the things that they enjoy and make them happy so they can have a dull, mainstream relationship with a bland, shallow, popular-mainstream-attractive sort of woman and get married to her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's essentially nothing but a terrible morality play for social conformity that tells men that they're wrong and says nothing about the terrible women. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not to mention how I'd never want anything to do with the shallow, careerist loser in Knocked Up with her horrible job. She's made out to be successful and pretty and great, but I loathe just about everything about her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
OK, sorry, that was a completely uncalled for rant, but you tapped deeply into my angry place. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I liked Zack and Miri. It was funny even if the central sex scene was really weird and betraying Smith's more recently dominant desires to make terrible romantic comedies.

      Do you secretly believe you're immortal, yet put on an existentialist front? Why would you possibly care? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe we all are living in gibbering terror at the concept.  <br/> 
Did you ever watch that TV series, Shogun? With Toshiro Mifune and Richard Chamberlain? Early on in the show, the Pilot/Anjin-san's crew are shipwrecked on the shore of a Japanese island. This is, like the 16th century.  <br/> 
The prospect of their ship demolished in an unknown, barbaric (in their view) land is enough for one of the crew to begin gibbering into a panic until he literally strokes out on fear and dies. Humans are actually capable of this type of emotional override of life function. I find that strange.

      Sorry, not that likely. I just picked it up from the same guy I stole "I'll burn that bridge when I come to it" from. He probably got it from Vonnegut. Seemed like a Vonnegut kind of guy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm pretty sure Vonnegut actually got the phrase from Fats Waller, who used to say "I wonder what the poor people are doing...I'd love to be with them!".  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it's just an old saying.  My source used it when something very redneck happened, like when a drunk person at a party knocks over the punchbowl or shits in the floor. I've always used it while enjoying simple pleasures with others of modest means, like over a grill full of meat, some domestic brew, and DVR full of Breaking Bad, Torchwood, and Reaper.

      The hell?! I did neither of those things, all I did was recommend the subscriber area because: <br/> 
 <br/> 
a) it is good value <br/> 
 <br/> 
b) it directly supports Achewood, which as you might be aware isn't the internet's most profitable business. <br/>

I don't like people complaining about something they got for free, and I don't know why I'm being attacked. <br/>

      Give me one single example of "making all non-subscribers out to be people essentially stealing content". <br/> 
Jesus Christ, fucking lighten up a bit. Subscribe, don't subscribe, what the fuck do I care. Just stop fucking complaining. This is a positive thing, people voted to give away what THEY'D ALREADY PAID FOR to everyone else, for nothing. <br/> 
Maybe set your "miserable cynicism" dial back down to medium for a couple of weeks. <br/>

      "Canon relevant" and "canon" are two different things. Most of the comics that post in the premium area are cuts from the strips that are posted, little jokes that would've made a main strip too long, panels that didn't end up fitting, or strips that were started and then abandoned. Then there's the occasional "this is funny but doesn't actually make sense given the characters" entire strip, and the even more rare strip like this one, that could probably have been a main site strip on its own. All the same, the fact that a strip fits into the last category doesn't make it canon if it doesn't post on the main site. <br/>

Which is, incidentally, why I voted that this one should go to everyone. I very much want to be able to call everyone hot tranny messes and have them understand where I'm coming from.

Next time try and use cliches that are more out of date, like falling off of carts, buying bridges, or involving the phrase "shoeshine" or patently offensive turn-of-the-century racial stereotypes. <br/>

      You've been living life like a demon, always busting through whatever got in your way. Usin' teeth or fists or the steel in your eye, you could say you treat everybody equally because you don't give a damn all the same. But then there was that one barfight that started cause some little fag was lookin at you for a little too long, just when you were about to put the first nice cool bottle of beer to your lips and suddenly it looked like a dick in your mind, so you went up and smashed it over his head. And as he lay bleeding on the floor, you decided to pick up his wallet and steal whatever cash he had on hand. And then you see his driver's license and the last name, and his age, and his resemblance to the one sweet thing you ever held in your bulging, useless arms: the girl you left because, hey if we're really being honest here, you thought one day comin you'd crush her in your grip -- maybe not literally, but hell some kinda way. And with the legacy of that liaison starin up at you with fading eyes, you run. Run motherfucker. Run into the night, the darkness, the only place you feel at home. Because the light can't shine off any mirrors that make you look yourself in the face. <br/>

      You can pay with PayPal, for which you only need a bank account. Also, I got a Visa Debit, for which you really only need a job (because the credit limit is $0). Any job. Really, I get paid $100 a week and I got one. They didn't even ask how much I get paid.

      Yeah. Basically every checking account anywhere gives you a debit card instead of an ATM card and has done so for quite a long period of time. Since at least '99 or so from even smaller banks. If I didn't live in a place where a disgusting number of places were cash-only I would basically use debit for almost every purchase no matter how small. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What we really need to get rid of is change though. Carrying around small bits of metal to pay for things? How thoroughly antiquated. I'm glad I don't live in a country with coins for low denominations of what ought to be bills.

      Not just the penny, but I'd be happy with the abolition of the nickel as well. Basically all coins except the quarter. I then want the quarter turned into a bill. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even better just let me make all of my transactions electronically with a small device used for this purpose or some sort of card. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm told that Japan, IIRC, uses aluminum for their lowest-denomination coin making it very cheap to produce and giving it a light, worthless feel appropriate to something of such little value. I approve strongly. <br/>

I see absolutely no need for pennies at all.

      Abolishing currency makes me leery about privacy issues. <br/> 
Also, I lived in Europe for a time, so eh... I'm not all that fond of bills. I mean, they're useful for larger denominations, but they last a very short time (especially the lower-denomination ones, which see more wear), so they're massively less efficient. There's a reason why the Treasury's pushing the new $1 coins - they really would save billions. Also, denominations of the Euro have a two-euro coin, so you can get all increments up to the five-euro bill with two coints or less. It's really not that inconvenient, because you worry about where that shit goes. It's the small stuff that gets lost in the cracks.

      No, it's ludicrously inconvenient. I can carry my wallet easily in my pocket and move it simply to a new pocket, but finding space for coins? Well, I either need to have some sort of bulky and unpleasant coin purse (that I will then have to hunt through because unlike bills I can't neatly organize them by denomination) or jam random wads of cash into pockets and seriously hope that I have a change pocket in them. A tiny little pocket that I can then fish around in and hope I happen to have the right coins. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Coins are really a terrible way to handle a currency. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Again, however, I loathe cash. I try to carry a maximum of $20 at any one time, but with so many places in SF being cash-only (and not just corner stores, but places where your restaurant bill will easily run $15-30 or worse) you're more or less screwed. Too many places seem to think that paying to use their janky unaffiliated ATMs somehow solves this problem, but there's no way in hell I'm going to pay to access my own money. They just want to pass the cost of the processing fee on to me and inflate it significantly over what they would pay. Cash is far too easy to lose or have stolen (the reason I carry so little of it). I mean, I've never actually lost my wallet, but I don't want the possibility to really be there. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm far less concerned about theoretical and, frankly, rather paranoid worries about privacy than I am about plain old-fashioned muggings and the supreme hassle that cash and fixed denomination bills so often are. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Give me a small wallet-sized device that can function as a combination digital money system with send/receive functionality and the ability to store local value, access to my bank, credit card (for those fools who still desire to senselessly incur debt), and multi-use ID/transit pass/passport and I'll be happy. Oh and put a small compartment into it, if possible, to store miscellaneous small papers and cards. This is clearly the way to go.

      Worries about privacy in an era of online banking and overwhelming prevalence of card-based transactions is hardly "paranoid." The government can, and does, track people's credit card purchases, ie when trying to catch criminals. It's NOT a far step from there to abuse of surveillance power. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And yeah, I wasn't saying that coins are more CONVENIENT (which, of course, is mostly because wallet design in America is bill-centric), but that they're not that unconvenient and that they're way more economical.

A personal favorite is to setup an obvious joke at my expense or comment that could be made into a lewd joke or double entendre by others and then acting appalled and indignant. <br/>

If you cannot make jokes at your own expense or willfully set yourself up for such jokes whenever necessary then you have no purpose ever attempting to be funny. <br/>

      okay guys you don't have to watch project runway in any way at all, ever, if you don't want to--  <em>yeeeesh</em> <br/>

I didn't mean to start an argument about irony, or what it means to watch something """"""ironically"""""", but maybe if any of you were familiar with The Soup, you'd know exactly what frame of mind I, and many others, are in when we watch shitty television.  Alright?  Rock of Love Bus 3 is on tonight, no more time.

      I watched it sporadically in the original Talk Soup incarnation, mainly when John was still hosting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know exactly what you're talking about and while it's not the technical definition of "ironic" I would say it comes in closely as you are definitely watching it in a way that causes you to derive pleasure from it in a way counter to the original intent. <br/>

Watching bad movies I can generally defend, but bad, trashy TV is where I draw the line.

      I don't really see a difference, except that movies are more a commitment time-wise, but eh. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for the original intent, I can almost 100 percent assure you that the savvy producers of Rock of Love and Flavor of Love, of Super Sweet 16 and the Real World/Road Rules Challenge realize that people are watching these shows because they want to see the participants make asses of themselves.  If you watched them, you'd probably agree.  Not that you have to, I really don't mind.  Different strokes, I'm just trying to explain how I, and almost everyone I know, view shitty television. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've never met a single person who actually liked the people who appear on those types of shows.  Nobody is a fan of...say...Thing 2 from Flava of Love.  Nobody.

      I think part of the problem is that in my ideal world being a reality show contestant would actually be a process where you are auditioning for your own execution. <br/> 
 <br/> 
These people need to be eliminated from our society. Though, in all fairness, the producers are even greater scum. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Since I  <em>am</em>  a pacifist, albeit an angry, dramatic, and hyperbolic one, I suggest instead that we banish them all. Perhaps we can take the big chunks of Montana that nobody is using or one of the more remote parts of Canada and eject them from civilized society after sterilizing them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't watch these shows because I loathe these people with intense passion. It does not amuse me to watch how horrible they are. I just hate them. Being terrible is something we ought to discourage. By even paying attention to them, even to deride them in this manner, you are supporting them and condoning their actions as a form of amusement.

      I've long wanted a Surivor show where survival was the actual goal. You're placed on a deserted island with the other contestants with a good knife, a small supply of food, and a few other small items and your goal is to survive. At any time you have the option of giving up and dropping out. If you are in actual danger of not making it and need to be evacuated for health reasons (I'd love to make it far more legitimately cut-throat and  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">Lord of the Flies</span> , but I'll make a concession to reality) you also lose by default. Last person left alive and surviving on the island wins the prize money. <br/> 
 <br/> 
None of this bullshit team game show on the beach crap with a high school popularity contest thrown in. Make a show that actually features real challenge and rewards you for actual accomplishment and skill. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only problem is how you successfully keep the camera crew out of it. Their presence would really disrupt things and the psychological state of being alone (unless, of course, you team up with other contestants who will likely only later betray you to win themselves) and trying to eke out an existence.

      Now yeah, that is a point worth making.  I really, really enjoy laughing at bad things happening to people, people ruin their father's opinions of them by shoving Brett Michael's head in their tits, and people just generally engage in extreme clownery.  It isn't all hilarious, The Soup is good enough for most everybody.  But I've got such a specific love of hate, I do it to myself.

      Yeah, but  <em>The Soup</em>  helps you catch some things that you'd inevitably miss out on otherwise. I mean, how many hours of  <em>The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet</em>  (whatever the hell that show even  <em>is</em> ) would you have to slog through waiting for something like  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100408120829/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ZsftPImew">this</a> ?

Apparently they're learning from the Internet. This is, perhaps, not a good thing for the future.

      Well, I guess I'm just in the minority then. I just didn't find it even remotely funny. If anything it felt tedious and forced without even a small crack where the humor could hope to seep in and perhaps damage the foundation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not a one though because it didn't make me want to stab someone like some other strips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The last few strips have generally been pretty good too (Beef and his Stomach was only an average, 3 strip) so it's up against some rough immediate competition along with all the many great strips of the past. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We've also been over how I rate before. Getting a 5 means you're destined to go on the Greatest Hits and we've only got so many slots. Can't hand those out all willy-nilly.

      Doing the math I've given about 9.27% of the strips a 5. Just looking at my list of 5'd strips I was thinking "hmm... this is too much, I need to exercise more judgment in the future", but I guess that's an appropriate number and very much in line with Sturgeon's Law. Not that average or merely above-average Achewood is crap, but that only 10% is the cream of the crop.

Ray's Financial Manners Guide For A Variety of Social Situations <br/> 
 <br/> 
$6 = cute money <br/> 
$60 = emergency dinner money. For when you are out at a casual dinner with friends and the situation is too urgent to divvy up the check and calculate tip <br/> 
$600 ("six hundo") = apology money <br/> 
$6000 = television court-ordered apology money (NOTE: The maximum that Judge Judy can award is only $5000, but if the mullet-rocking redneck couple managed to beat you in a contest of logic and words there is nothing else proper to do than to congratulate them with an extra $1000 for a well-played match) <br/> 
$60,000 = the amount you pay for an American car to help out with the recession (MEMO ON CHECK: "Hey Detroit. My condolences. Tell your Mom I said hi.") <br/> 
$600,000 ("six hundo G's") = A reasonable salary for the CEO of a company right now. The ones that got bailed out are only getting $500,000 because of a stern look from Barack Obama, but since you have not failed at life, you give yourself an extra hundo G to show that business principles still mean something in this town. <br/> 
$6,000,000 = You are out with your girl at a lavish evening ball where live classical music is playing, which means dancing has rules (too bad). You are in the middle of a conversation with Admiral Ranjit Saravay of the British Navy (you can tell by his ethnicity that he has moved up in the world), learning of his ways. You are just about to impress him with your knowledge of the recent film "Slumdog Millionaire" when your girl does a :-(. Everyone looks at you. This will surely ruin you if it gets out. The amount is silencing money.

      If your company needed to get bailout money then you actually have failed at life more or less.

      i don't join premium achewood because a) most of my monies still come from my parents, so any free money i have that isn't going to food and/or cigarettes goes toward helping them help me pay interest on student loans and b) achewood already takes up too much of my damn freetime. its too fucking good! i should be doing chemistry, psychology, and religion homework right now, besides playing super smash bros. brawl, keeping in touch with friends and putting the finishing production touches on a song i wrote for my girlfriend, which was supposed to be done in time for valentine's day. <br/> 
also, i have not showered shaved or eaten in about 1.5 days, because i'm a big hot tranny mess :-(

      Scientifically called Flatus or Flatulance ,it is what happen when gases (mostly Nitrogen and Carbon dioxyde) created by the digestive process are evacuated by the anus, producing a often discernible sound. The smell is mostly made of reduced sulphuric coumpound. The sound is created by the vibration of the anal sphyncter or sometimes the cleched buttocks.

      it's nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) when you are talking about guinness.  <br/>

methane is one bi-product of anaerobic respiration. sulphur dioxide is another... neither are too pleasant to smell. CO2 and N2 are have no scent.

      One million in fur. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mad Max taught me many things; one of the main things was that people will always need fur, fur to keep them warm.  More than any gold, after all, what is the actual value of gold other than the assumption at a point in time that it was very, very rare?  Soon enough the asteroid Crencampus will crash into us, ushering in a new era where the standard ore to which we measure all things will be Crencampantium. <br/> 
 <br/> 
so i guess more than anything i just will take one million against gold in the year 2016, bear market style

      Man, Dexter sucked. It had terrible acting by everyone except the lead, a dumb backstory, and the guy isn't even a serial killer, just a vigilante. Plus, they totally wuss out and never show us anything even remotely gorey (I watched the DVDs so it wasn't the censors that got to it either). I mean, we don't even see him killing people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It felt like a lame rip-off of CSI that they decided to make "edgy". But edgy for a CBS audience. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I want something more like  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted">American Psycho</span> . The book, not the movie. If he's not starving a sewer rat only to put it in a tube up a woman's lady bits or burning nipples off with a blowtorch (was it a blowtorch?) then I'm not interested. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seriously, Dexter was astoundingly dull. The only good part was the excellent opening sequence that not only worked really well and looked great, but never failed to make me intensely hungry.

      I'm pretty sure that as a civilian, killing people for the fun of it makes you a serial killer.  Sure, he chooses targets that "deserve" to die - but he needs to kill. <br/> <br/> <br/> I think you wanting to watch people die puts you in the minority.

      But the idea of using it to mete out justice and choose deserving targets really just changes the show around and makes him less a serial killer and more of a vigilante. It's more like a one-man lynch mob. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, if we saw him taking his time, clearly enjoying it that might make it a bit different, not enough, but closer. It really just doesn't work. Picking someone who "deserves" to die in a manner that might be sympathetic to audience really cuts through many of the conventional problems of serial killing. I don't agree with capital punishment in any situation myself, but still. If he had insane reasons for why people deserved it I might be there, but no. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He just ends up coming across as a cop who goes too far in order to see that "justice" is done. I want stalking, I want fantasizing about the kill, I want him to reminisce about past kills. Yes he saves blood (because he's a massive idiot... also a very lame trophy to keep), but it's nowhere near close enough to sell him to me as an actual serial killer.

      I think your reasons for debunking the show are more to do with your taste in serial killer depiction. As far as psychopathy goes it's  <em>reasonably</em>  accurate. The show seems far more about Dexter as an odd anomaly of a psychopathy disorder. All psych disorders work on a continuum.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As far as him killing in a audience approved way, well, I guess that's more of a Narcissist thing but it's not too much of a stretch.

Most of the Night Rider's lines in the opening scenes are AC/DC lyrics. But I think my favourite quote would be: <br/> 
"Anything ... I say. What a wonderful philosophy y'have." <br/>

Sadly, Reg Evans, the actor who played the terrified station master in that scene died in the Victorian bushfires of early February 2009. RIP.

      I don't know, but my German professor told me, and I assume it's contained to a kind of bin in the corner or something.  I bet they can use most of the rest of the basement.

I have poorly conveyed my concerns and apologise to yourself and randyleepublic who both felt I was making some kind of debateable point. The problem is mine. Leave me here. Go on with your lives.

Anyway, every show is incredibly easy to miss if you've got cable. Basically, there has to a dearth of non-military documentaries, animation, cooking, eating, traveling, supernatural comedies, supernatural action, police procedurals, and stand-up comedy before I would even turn the channel to a reality television show.

      TiVo really helps quite a bit with this as well. I think the problem is people aimlessly flipping around. When you watch TV with a purpose you'll find the process works a lot better. <br/>

      I hope I don't really have to answer that question. I don't, do I? <br/>

Seriously, though - while I've only seen maybe two full episodes of it, I will go as far as saying that the American version does have a couple of things going for it, namely Alton Brown and Masaharu Morimoto. But even those two bona fide culinary heroes are not near enough to make me want to sit through it. <br/>

      Look, I understand Onstad's been busy lately, and I also understand that he needs to make money.  Wanting to read more Achewood than was being posted on the main site over the last couple of months, I ponied up the 10 bucks for the three months of access to the premium content due to the promises of subscriber-only content. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now I think it's nice that other people get to see this previously-subscriber-only strip, but I didn't pay 10 dollars for more Achewood content only to have that content later reposted in lieu of new content on the main page.  I didn't pay for the content because I wanted to read the strips a week or two earlier than they got posted on the main site, and the fact that he's reposting this instead of putting a new strip on the main site irks me some.

      What are you talking about?  You paid ten dollars to see a strip others could not see, and now you are angry because instead of reading a new comic others can read the exclusive comic?  It's hard for me not to see you as a dick, because I really like this comic and I am happy that I can see it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I bet it's going to take Onstad a while to get into the swing of things.  Achewood seems very rooted in a sort of Bay Area vibe, and now that he's in a new place I think he's going to have to figure out how to either recreate that vibe or find something new to portray.

      Personally, I felt the same way as schnappm when I saw this strip, the second "subscriber exclusive" in the last few weeks to make up for lack of content on the original site.  Like schnappm, I came home from work to find that there was "vote" on this in the subscriber section had been introduced and finalized before I even checked my personal mail (which I rarely do at work these days).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not going to lie or beat around the bush; Onstad's near complete lack of inability to meet his own deadlines for about 5 months running now, coupled with what seemed to be a new habit of taking stuff people paid for and turning it into free stuff only two weeks afterwards, was  <em>exactly</em>  what schnappm said it was: irksome.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not incredulous or illegal or morally unjust or something to rant and rave over (blastradius), but it's been bugging me.  After reading a bit of the info regarding the "vote," I was okay with it, I suppose: I don't mind a strip like this being posted here, as long as he doesn't continue to advertise it, as he he did, as a "subscriber-only strip" (exact quote).   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I could be misreading Onstad's statements, but it seemed like he was admitting that he hadn't done anything for the main site (or was busy with something else), and threw up something he came up with for the subscribers as a place-saver.  You can say he's doing the right thing now, but really, he did basically screw over the subscribers, at first. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's a lot of other subscriber content that isn't put on here, and a lot of it is great.  I don't regret signing up and I'll continue to subscribe; but let's face it, this  <em>was</em>  a pretty fucking sketchy move. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Oh, and for the record, I didn't want to sound like I was bitching about Onstad not putting up enough strips on here; Onstad could only post a strip on here every 2 weeks, I wouldn't mind, but damn, he should stop setting these deadlines if he's never going to meet them.

      Fair comments, but he has just moved his family to a new city while simultaneously trying to please the people who demand 4 strips a week, give him a break.  <br/> 
As for not meeting his own deadlines, I wouldn't want him posting something substandard on the day he said he would just because he said he would post on that day, and neither would you I'm sure. <br/> 
You can't force creativity. <br/> 
On the other hand, maybe he's finding it a bit tough writing for the Premium Lounge as well as the main site at the same time. After all people are paying for regular updates, but the first priority must be (and should be) the main site. <br/> 
I'm just saying cut the man some slack.

      I don't think it's sub-standard, I think it's him. He frequently delays it by maybe 12 hours or so. That looks, to me, like someone who started working on the strip too late and late at night realizes he isn't getting it done, has already missed his deadline, and is just going to go to sleep and finish it off in the morning.

      If you say "hey strip is coming out AT THIS EXACT TIME", you should meet this deadline. This is probably the reason why most webcartoonists simply say "Updates will usually come out on such-and-such day" but will not say what TIME they are coming out, to leave leeway. I think that THIS is what is upsetting people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know someone else has said this, but since most of the art on the strip is copy-pasted from a bank of images, there has to be someway that Chris can just automatically upload the strip at midnight at such and such day!

      I understand the move, the hassle, the other projects, etc.  I don't want to lambast the guy.

I'll state again, my problem with him not meeting his deadlines is not that I demand more Achewood, it's just that he's setting these deadlines in the first place, publicly, and hasn't been meeting them for months now, almost as a rule.  Get the strip up whenever, I don't really care, but I've defintely noticed more and more people getting annoyed by the missed deadlines on assetbar, and I've also noticed less hostility to those that do (people used to get lamed to hell for complaining about that).  It's kind of pathetic to see anybody set so many deadlines and almost never make them; it makes you frustrated  <em>for</em>  them.  There's no need to set these public deadlines, as far as I can tell (he doesn't run ads on the site, right?  Is there another way to make money off of the hits from people constantly checking for updates?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
It doesn't seem like the main site is the grade A #1 priority anymore, though; Onstad is always talking about how other projects are interferring with a strip getting up, etc.  It might still be the priority, but not so much that other projects don't get in the way (and I'm not talking about family/moving; that stuff "getting in the way" is beyond criticism).  Again, I don't care about that, though...he can work on other projects; I'm not about to tell the guy how to voice his creative process.  I might love it or I might hate it when it comes out, but he's gonna do what he's gonna do. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've cut the guy slack, I keep cutting him slack, but, personally, as a guy who has taken advantage of a lot of slack given to him, I know when slack is being abused.  Posting this strip felt like one of those times to me.  If he kept posting stuff on the main site originally advertised as "subscriber-only" only  <em>2 weeks</em>  after it's appearance on the premium site, yeah, I would've been pissed.  $3 is a pittance, and I like giving Onstad monetary support (I've also bought shirts, books, etc.), but there's a time when you start to feel like your getting duped.

      I think, honestly, that Chris should do away with the subscription and work off donations. This is not out of some greediness on my part to get something free (something we've been getting for a while free) but because I think that ultimately it might work out better. I'm more willing to donate a dollar or so towards the cause than have to give 3 dollars for updates that ultimately I probably won't read or care about after a while. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also would rather that Chris just focus on whatever major projects he is working on and put Achewood on hiatus. I honestly think that this is a better course of action than pissing off half of the viewer base weekly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
FINALLY I think that Chris should be a part of Project Wonderful/the Truth and Beauty Bomb community, although that is more wishful thinking than anything and would probably be akin to God going to church.

      Yeah, I know, it's a lot easier and cool to stay above the fray, I get it, thanks.  It's all a bunch of bitching and moaning that'll never do any good.  but, hey! guess what.  I've never gotten involved in any of those 8 foot long threads about rape or whatever, so I got that going for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I actually didn't read much on this page in general, let alone each post on these new strips the last few weeks (getting out of the habit during the hiatus   actually having work to do was great).  Was there a lot of real friction between people on this?  I thought we had a pretty reasonable interaction going on in this instance.

      Agreed. It's mainly that he keeps making promises and then failing to live up to them. I wouldn't mind if he didn't make an unnecessary promise in the first place. <br/>

      <em>As he felt the bed against the back of his knees, something in the back of Belgand's mind flipped. His hands stopped shaking as he tugged his shirt over his head, breaking the kiss just long enough to admire him. The man was a drug. He wanted more.<br/>
Belgand reached to pull him back but he turned the tables. His hands steered him to sit on the bed then slipped his own top off. A surge of sexual confidence filled him while Belgand stared. Every other time Belgand had had sex he'd let the man lead, not wanting to make a wrong move. This time it would be different - he could feel it.<br/>
He unwrapped his skirt and let it fall, rewarded with the sight of his erection growing under his jeans. Standing in his underwear and pumps, Belgand didn't let his hands stop for fear that he might feel self-conscious. Instead he unhooked his bra. He felt sexy and safe with Belgand - it was an intoxicating first.<br/>
Belgand reached for himself again. He stepped back and out of his pumps as he let the lacey underwire bra fall. Not one to give up control, he slipped a finger between his lavender French-cut underwear and his hip and tugged until the panties joined the rest of his clothes on the floor.<br/>
Unable to wait anymore, he ran his hand up his arm while straddling himself. Belgand let his hands mold over Belgand's chest. "You must work out."<br/>
"You want to discuss that now?" He cracked a subtle smile.<br/>
"You%u2019ll need the stamina." He licked his lips.<br/>
Belgand reached for himself again. Belgand knew he'd have to concentrate to keep his sanity. His hands were gentle but not tentative. They cupped his breasts, teasing his nipples until he arched his back for more. There was no doubt what he wanted. Belgand slipped his hand lower and opened Belgand's jeans.<br/>
He wasn't about to rush or act as eager as he felt. Instead he slowly ran one long mauve-painted nail up his hard cock. The idea that he'd aroused himself so fully made him want himself more.<br/>
Belgand leaned back on his hands with a groan. "You're a tease."<br/>
Belgand smiled with growing confidence. He could do anything. Have anything with him. He'd doubted his plan? At the moment, he had no idea why. Belgand would enjoy it as much as Belgand would.<br/>
"Do I pass inspection?" His voice was raspy but made Belgand shiver.<br/>
"Definitely worth further study." From Belgand's somewhat limited hands-on research, he could tell Belgand's penis was roughly average length. Maybe a bit better. It was the thickness that had him getting wetter by the second.<br/>
He shifted off himself and knelt down for a closer look. Softly he tongued the head as he muttered something that sounded encouraging. The taste of him clouded his mind even more. He kissed his way up his chest letting his sensitive pussy press against his shaft. His body was just too good.</em>

      It is a little known fact that Belgand cannot get a date to save his life <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is through no fault of his own, of course. It is certainly not his lack of charisma or personality, for he is well liked among his peers and wildly popular; nor is he not suitably attractive, because he is, on one of his good days, ridiculously so. When he enters a room, teenage girls swallow their tongues and teenage boys go green with envy and, in a few unsurprising cases, vice versa.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The trouble begins when Belgand approaches one of these voiceless girls (and on one occasion, he is not too proud to admit, one of the voiceless boys) they remain voiceless. It's very difficult to carry on a conversation with a person who has simultaneously lost their nerve and ability to form coherent speech, and while Belgand is many things, he is not the type to spend a significant amount of time with someone who cannot, at the very least, laugh at his jokes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So through no fault of his own is Belgand dateless, friendless and endlessly frustrated. He is loathe to admit it, but he wouldn't know what to do with a girl (or boy, for that matter (well, this is not entirely true. He has a vague idea, being of the male persuasion himself)) even if he could get one to talk to him. He routinely inspects himself critically in a mirror and likes what he sees: You, my friend, he thinks smugly at the mirror, preening his hair and oozing the exact sort of confidence he is famous (and infamous) for, are one good-looking kid. Who wouldn't want a piece of this? <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is at this precise moment that Belgand gets the worst or possibly best idea of his young life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The idea comes slowly, in stages, because he cannot believe he has thought what he thinks he just thought, and the really amazing thing is that he can see it happening, in his own eyes, in the mirror, and it makes the worst or possibly best idea of his young life just that much more real, because just as he is thinking "I am brilliant," another part of him is thinking "Oh, man, brilliance is hot." He is suddenly so taken with his own cleverness that the worst or probably best idea of his young life seems more feasible with every passing second. He gives himself one last, fierce stare in the mirror, ignoring the little part of him that insists the definitely best idea of his young life might actually be bad, but since Belgand has an incredible amount of experience ignoring that little part of himself, it is no surprise that he can turn away from the mirror and march to the garage with the very confidence he is so famous (and infamous) for. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the time he has locked himself securely in the garage, the idea has become a plan. An utterly foolproof, brilliant plan that requires no actual effort on Belgand's part. At least not yet. At precisely 2 p.m. in the afternoon, Belgand stands before the time machine %u2013 the blue one, with the nice back seat %u2013 and makes a decision that will effortlessly put the unarguably best plan of his young life into action. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"At five o' clock," he says aloud to no one, enjoying the smooth sound of his own voice, "I will take the time machine back to two o'clock."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And it's as easy as that, because before the words have left his tongue, there is flash of light and the familiar sound of soap bubbles popping and an extra time machine in the garage, and Belgand is staring quite dumbly up at himself, behind the controls. The Belgand in the time machine is looking very sly and proud of himself.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"It worked," he announces, reclining to sling one slim arm over the back of his seat and prop his feet up on the dashboard. Belgand-on-the-ground can't help but notice he looks very cocky like this, and he is very slightly irritated, but not so much so that he can't also admit he is one smooth operator. Belgand-in-the-time-machine is still giving him a sort of half-lidded leer and a quirky smirk. "We've only got a few hours," he says, checking the little clock in the dash. "Are we gonna do this or not? That's a rhetorical question, actually. I'm from the future." He thumbs his chest and grins a truly dashing grin. "I already know the answer." <br/> 
 <br/> 
So Belgand hefts himself easily into the time machine and sits beside himself. "Backseat," his future self instructs as he closes the hood and initiates the cloaking devices. Belgand obliges and climbs gracelessly into the backseat, absently wondering why his father felt the need to build a full size time machine if they had never once taken it on a family vacation and oh man, if he only knew how it were being used now, they never will. It makes his cheeks flush pink, thinking about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"You're cute when you blush," his future self teases as he slides into the backseat beside him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"This is so messed up," Belgand blurts, feeling that little part of himself he is so used to ignoring reasserting itself. "There is probably something very wrong with me for even thinking about doing this." He is blushing even harder. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Everybody does it," Future Belgand says silkily as he scoots a little closer, casually draping an arm over Present Belgand's shoulders. "Most kids just aren't lucky enough to have the means to do it so well." His fingers slide down Belgand's upper arm and back up again, slipping under his sleeve. It's a simple motion, hardly indecent at all, but it feels strangely intimate and erotic and Belgand can't figure out why, because it's just his arm, and his hand to boot, right? He touches his own arm experimentally, but it doesn't illicit quite the same feeling as when the other Belgand does it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Just as he is about to experiment further, he feels a sudden warmth on the side of his face because Future Belgand has taken advantage of this moment of analytical distraction to lean over and press his lips gently against the curiously sensitive place just below his ear and Present Belgand's brain responds by reeling and splintering, and he suddenly very seriously does not care about the psychological mechanics of auto-erotica as much as he cares about feeling this way as long and as powerfully as humanly possible. He turns to his future self with wide, astonished brown eyes and a slack jaw and manages maybe two shaky breaths before the two of them are a clumsy tangle of one hungry boy on the back seat of his father's time machine.

      I was hoping it would be about other denizens of the 'bar, but if it must be me fucking myself in increasingly improbable scenarios then so be it. It has my blessing. Give me the best you've got Assetbar. Or, at least, allow me to give it to myself.

      Yes, the $2.99/month lets you see extra Achewood strips.  PVP is another webcomic, I think, and for a separate monthly payment you get to see  <em>its</em>  premium content. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Freezepop is a rock band, or something like that.  It's what you'd get if you surreptitiously replaced a rock band's guitars and drums with Texas Instruments calculators.  Not the ordinary, grade-school calculators, mind you; those would give you a generic top-40 sound.  No, we're talking about high-end graphing calculators, full of logarithms and justice.  For yet another $2.99 per month, you get to see (and quite possibly hear) premium content from the Frezepoppers.

      It is definitely some version of -adore as you will recall his IM name  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100408120829/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua81xwGX">in the past</a>  was "T-Adore". Thus, that is how I pronounce it. <br/>

      Seriously, why do you keep putting up these times when you never, ever actually stick to them? I think the only time in recent memory was when old content was put up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I understand the desire to constantly refine something. Of never being quite happy with a joke and wanting to polish and repolish and continue second-guessing yourself, but you need to learn to either plan better, make more realistic deadlines for yourself, or build up a backlog and actually only list a time when strips will go up once you have a completed strip ready to go.

      I know I promised not to start this argument again, because frankly it is even wearing me out, but the idea that "8 years of charity doesn't mean you are guaranteed a 9th" and that "Chris Onstad doesn't owe us anything" seems illogical. It is not like Chris is giving us something for free we have to pay for everywhere else. If he was, the first statement would be 100 percent true. But it ISN'T charity, it is a service that is offered for free by many other people, so I shouldn't have to pay extra money just to get "the better stuff" (which I'm not saying we HAVE to). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, no, Chris doesn't owe us ANYTHING, he owes us EVERYTHING. We are loyal fans and readers, who buy pretty much any and everything the man produces. Without us he would not be in business. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And to finish something I should have said earlier, keir I was wrong in calling you annoying. It wasn't YOU that was annoying it was the fact that you basically spammed the comment board with advertisements for the subscriptions, apropos of nothing, and accrued large amounts of chubbies for it. Considering I've been yelled at plenty of times for "blogging up Assetbar" I find it rather ridiculous that you weren't at least questioned for this.

      I find your whole attitude really unnecessarily negative. <br/> 
I take your point that he owes his living to us. However, he's never, ever forced us to pay for anything. There aren't even any ads on this site, which I'm sure you'll agree is pretty goddamn rare. <br/> 
What he  <em>has</em>  done is given us what I consider to be the best comic strip of all time, for nothing. He offers us books, t-shirts etc, and we buy them. He offers us a premium lounge, and we sign up. He has gone out of his way every  <em>step</em>  of the way not to be some greasy money-grubbing internet entrepreneur and all some people can do is complain about missed deadlines. Yes, I supposes I agree that setting specific deadlines and then not meeting them is mildly annoying, but come on, give him a break. <br/> 
Maybe I can put your mind at ease about one thing. The premium lounge is cool, but it isn't  <em>that</em>  cool, i.e. the real stuff is, and always will be on the main site. <br/> 
Lastly, I apologise for spamming the board (even though it was only like 3 comments), but I truly think the premium lounge is worth the small amount of money you have to pay.
