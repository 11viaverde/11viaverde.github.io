      No, I liked it when you prayed to the dead god, very Zarathustra. We killed him, we proclaimed it in the marketplace, but then we continued to pray to him from sheer inertia. We truely WERE NOT worthy of the act of killing god, as the old man proclaimed.

      Not to imply that this is where you were going, but I would add that a lame reflects on the lamer as much as the lamee.  If you disagree with someone, this is a comment board; you are free to reply.  If you want to discourage rude behavior or bad puns, a lame is appropriate.  If it's just that you have taken a dislike to a stranger on the Internet, look in the mirror.

      I've always thought the best way to think about anything is to strip it down to its basics, to remove all ornament and vague fluffery, all added flavor and color. To find an idea's empirical atomic number, I suppose. Cars may come with air conditioning and awesome stereos and they may get you tail like you'll never believe, but their function remains transportation and so that's what matters when considering buying one of the damn things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, when it comes to life, one of the most interesting and depressing things is how simple it is. A car's chief purpose and characteristic is transportation - it justifies its existence in this way. But life is sort of weird, because <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. The purpose of life is to keep living. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And that's about it, really. There's plenty of other living things in the world less sentient than us and the only thing we really have in common with them is how we'd very much like to keep living. We can add all the neuroticisms we want later about God and love and sex and purpose, but the brutal truth of it is that in order to qualify for the basic definition of life all you have to do is keep living. Keep eating and sleeping and surviving.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Human life is doubly perplexing. We can figure out ways to fulfill the basic requirements of life in the most comfortable way possible, eating the best food, sleeping in the most comfortable beds, fucking around... It's as though the awareness that the only thing to really do around here is just keep living makes living itself twice as hard.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wake up in the morning. I put one foot in front of the other until it takes me back to bed. Things happen along the way, or they don%u2019t. Sometimes they%u2019re big, sometimes they%u2019re little. Sometimes I notice, sometimes I don%u2019t. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You keep going, because what else can you do?

      Yeah, assetbar doesn't like me copying and pasting from gmail apparently, as I was discussing this issue with a depressed friend and finished in the same way. For those who are terrified of percent signs, here's the clean version: <br/>

"I wake up in the morning. I put one foot in front of the other until it takes me back to bed. Things happen along the way, or they don%u2019t. Sometimes they%u2019re big, sometimes they%u2019re little. Sometimes I notice, sometimes I don%u2019t." <br/>

      I tend to, when it comes to internet boards.  I let things bother me, say some things, and people get riled up.  Still, I'm not saying he can't express himself, I'm saying it annoys me when I've got to scroll through 2000 words of the same guy every time I want to check the board.  Not saying he can't continue to do that, just saying that maybe he wants to think about doing the quality over quantity thing for a bit.  As far as the avatar - why have another man's face represent your words?  False status, unless you are Stephen Fry.   <br/>

      I dunno, I sorta like the discussion stuff. There's been longer posts before, more thought out stuff than anything I put up here, and I think it's a shame when people just think "tl;dr" and blow by. It's a board about a web comic, sure, but this is a pretty insular crowd with a fondness for something that touches on a variety of subjects, and I can't imagine getting mad if someone wants to talk about those subjects.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, Onstad's got a knack for prose and his characters are way more verbose than a lot of the other ones out there, so it's naturally going to attract talky people. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, those are my excuses for being a long-winded fuck.

      Paraphrasing something someone else said on another strip, if you think this is just a comic you're not reading closely enough. As long as you continue to be entertaining and don't just post "INTERNET" a thousand times, I think you'll continue to be a beloved Acheworld staple. I for one enjoy your tangents.

I myself have just stumbled into this ridiculously pleasant thing called drambuie and, having had it with lime, club soda, apple juice, and chickory coffee, I must say that I can't imagine holding ill will against anyone at all. Even if they've fired a round into my upper arm. Seriously. <br/>

      I feel somewhat along the same lines.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've always thought of life as a zero sum equation.  come from nothing end up with nothing.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
0 = 1 1-2 ....=  <strong>0</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
All I have is the space between 0's and whatever I can make of it.  To savour every experience like the taste of a cherry; sometimes sour, sometimes perfect.  And to stop reaching for more of that fruit is to abandon the only thing you will ever have. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To have eaten nothing but sour cherries will make a sweet one seem most marvelous.  To have eaten nothing but sweet cherries would dull their spectacular taste to your tongue.   <br/> 
All you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Beef might be a depressed man, but don't you know just how he feels when Molly would take him for what he is and treat him and Dracula like the sun shone out of it?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Finally another rare sweet cherry that could not be enjoyed by anyone more.

      Okay can we all agree to admit that Teodor is hella jealous of his friend Roast Beef such as to the point that he wants to vicariously be the perfect boyfriend through him? This is a familiar thing to me; I remember my worst single times when I was convinced I could be the perfect boyfriend to any woman  <em>if they would only just listen</em> , handin' three month anniversary cards perfectly picked out to my best friends with their names pre-signed in  <em>permanent marker</em> , poppin' up in the backseat of their cars while they're making out, all "Hey, guys,  <em>do you want to go bowling?</em> " and when they run away screaming I'm like "Damn doggs its not like the pins have wives and goldfish."

One of the many problems with Valentine's day is that it falls in an inhospitable season. If it fell in even mid-March, then the forgetful or impecunious man could organise a picnic for his lady, and it would seem romantic. As it is raining on Valentines day, the best such a man could do is to get one of those Salmon of Doubt fancy meals you make yourself in a box. The thing is then that you are basically tagged as phoning the whole effort in. Possibly the only way to avoid that would be to trigger your lady's social phobia, such that she thinks that the whole staying in is as a result of her.

      This is something that I've considered for a while.  I'm not sure if Teodor actually has genuine feelings for Molly, though.  It could be that she's really the only lady he interacts with, aside from Tina I suppose.  I'm not saying that Molly isn't deserving of his affection, just that at this point, Teodor's probably gonna go after whatever he can find.

      M. Night Shayamalan movies are to actors as drunken hookups with terrifically ugly people are to college freshmen. <br/>

At some point, you must have been wrapped up in the craziness of what was happening -- but now you realize you've only lowered your standards to painful levels.

      I thought for a minute about saying something in Shayamalan's defense, but I definitely would not have used  <em>Lady in the Water</em>  to make that point. I mean,  <em>I</em>  kinda liked it. But that particular film is not necessarily the best proof of his artistic merit to any dedicated non-fan. In fact, I think it may be a primary reason that there are so many non-fans around these days. It was a risky project, and that's bound to cause rifts of opinion. Which is OK.  <em>The Sixth Sense,</em>  on the other hand, is hard for anyone to seriously argue against, unless they are doing so solely in order to be contrary about it. It may be old news, but it was kind of really groundbreaking. Whether or not they liked it, they have to at least admit that.

      <em>The Sixth Sense</em>  was a movie before Shayamalan movies became  <em>Shayamalan</em>  movies. It was a screenplay edited to better fit the conventions of a typical hollywood film.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once he got artistic freedom, Shayamalan has done little other than poop on his audience. <br/>

 <em>Metaphorically</em> , of course.

      I see that this strip now has the second highest rating of all. It is behind only "Ray Gets Sort of Stoned." Now, don't get me wrong - this  <em>is</em>  a great strip. But we're gettin' into pretty sacred territory, here. I'm not sure how I'd feel if this strip (which I see as a 4 - a very strong 4, yes, but a 4) were to eclipse a strip which has kind of changed my life (in that at least one or two panels of it pretty much cross my mind at least once a day). That would be strange. And it wouldn't matter.

      COME ON GUYS you are all so lame.  This is one of the best examples of antihumor and absurdist humor I've ever seen.  It's beautiful.  It tells a meaningful, well-wrought story, and then suddenly it turns out it was all buildup for a bad pun. THIS, my friends, is Humor.  It made me laugh until I started coughing.  I can't believe you all are pissed just because it's long.  And yet you claim to like Manflesh?  What is that, some cult of personality?  There is no reason that this is any worse than anything Manflesh does; when you think about it, Manflesh has occasional witty comments, and I'll be the first to admit he can be hilarious, but his main claim to fame is posting Star Trek slashfics.
