      I think it's just Ray's general lack of respect for his elders. From what I can tell, Ray basically considers himself to be in his prime. Plus he has a huge fear of diabetes - a disease that largely affects the elderly. Maybe, despite all Connie's badassity and sharpness, he just figures that anyone older than a certain age is going to get  <em>all</em>  the negativity associated with being old. Senility included. <br/>

Just a spur-of-the-moment theory, though.

All, or at least close to all, of the fascist right-wing patriots moved to Oregon or Texas or Nevada a long time ago.

      Ray isn't normally self-conscious.  I don't what you're basing it on, thinking he should be here.  I'd say he's acting totally in character.  He's telling it like it is...at least how he thinks it is.  If he takes it too far, he might feel bad about it afterwards, but he'll say what he thinks as he thinks it. Of course he's wrong about Cornelius, but he watches out for his friends, and this is just another example of that.

      Are you forgetting that Mr. Bear is talking to a computerized bird? This is not a "neat" resolution at all. In fact, if it is a resolution (which I doubt), that is troubling for the future of Cornelius. Ray%u2019s worry is shared by me. Cornelius does not easily get sucked into the machinery of others: as you note he is %u201Cunflappable,%u201D cool enough to win the title of baddest dude around. But this arc has shown him as anything but that. It was easy for him to sink into committing a crime, become friends with a bird on a laptop made in England, and plot the death of Lyle. How remarkably un-Cornelius-like. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As a character, Cornelius does feature many %u201Cgentlemanly%u201D tropes but it is where he diverges that I find fantastic characterization. 1) He is a stuffed bear.  2) He writes trashy (but brilliant) romance novels and used to do closed-captioning for the spice channel. 3) He is definitely not afraid of the police after drinking tequila. (this may be unfair since it was so early in the sequence. Nevertheless, it is his divergence, the unexpected that makes him great.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In any case, grow up.

      I think that's the point of this arc... it's a stereotypical "parlor mystery" as Connie says in the last panel of yesterday's strip. <br/>

It keeps him entertained amidst the pedestrian drudgery of the internet.  Connie would be too sagacious for AssetBar. <br/>

      It's him.  It's from "Arrested Development."  He played the family's inept attorney, Barry Zuckercorn.  This scene was good, but I'll always prefer the scene in the bathroom in the first season where he combs his hair and then does the "Fozzy" look in the mirror, admiring himself.

      Wow, I had no idea there were so many nationalist superheores. I imagine Captain Britain must ahve a tougher time, theres less of an entrenched national identity this side of the pond (for better or worse). does Ireland have one perchance?  <br/>

      Aye, when you ask people no-one can come up with a coherent response, few people know all the words to the (quite frankly tedious and irrelevant) national anthem, people more willingly describe themselves as "English", "scottish", "Welsh", "Northern Irish", "A Northerner", "A Southerner". Plus when people attempt to describe "Britishness" they find it extremely difficult, especially now in a consumer driven globalised world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Additionally the colour of our buses and phone boxes,the fact some of us occaisionally eat roasted meat on a sunday and the fact we play sports played (Arguably with a lot more skill) by loads of other countries dont make up a national character or identity. <br/>

In response to your p.s., I agree, and again I apologise. Not to shades. Just to everyone who had to witness the whole ordeal. She just sort of attacks me all the time, and every other comment of hers that I've read has managed to piss me off, and I was getting bored of being passive. <br/>

      Shakespeare dispatched King Hamlet with  <em>poison in the ear,</em>  and dwelt no longer on it. If Mr Teal is out of character, it is because he has a gauche fixation on the non-U preparation that distracts him from the U act. The average Briton will kill a stranger after a brief conversation at least once in his lifetime, and the last words of those stranger shall be 'Too right, guv.' The next of kin figure it out for themselves. There is no funeral; there may be, for a time, symbolic mourning for Lady Diana. They refer to this as 'happy slapping'; you may have heard of it.

      This feels like a retcon. If the conclusion that virtually all of us came to (that all three assistants were the same person) was wrong, then why did he share all three of their names? <br/>

I've been trying to avoid saying this, but it must be said - all in all, this is a pretty piss poor story arc. "Fetching Cornelius" was a gem, but it doesn't justify the obscene amount of strips this arc has taken up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As per yesterday's discussion, feel free to lame me, but I'd sincerely like to know if anyone can argue that today's strip was any good in any conceivable way.

      I've actually been loving this arc, and I'd probably cite most of what's happened so far as my favorite Achewood since (the obvious choice) The Great Outdoor Fight. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This strip just seemed like a way to drag the story along.  Instead of running with The_Boffin direction, we're back to plotting with Mr. Teal.  Who I am getting tired of at this point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll hold any final judgment for when the story finishes, of course.

      I always reserve my judgement of entire arcs until I read them at least a second time well after they're finished.  Some of my favorite arcs now are ones that I found tedious to read day by day when they first came out (Lonis Edison, Cartilage Head, the Great Outdoor Fight). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I doubt this one will change much on repeated readings, though.  I've mostly found it rather boring and maybe a little too dry...as I have most of Onstad's recent forays into Anglophilia, unique though they often are.  It's all seemed a little too forced.

      i feel like this arc has contradicted itself a bit, but this particular direction is strong. mr. teal is slowly poisoning cornelius's mind against lyle. WHAT WILL GO DOWN?

      I think the arc is probably finished now.  At least, I hope so.  I thought it was pretty funny, but I think this would be a good ending.  Cornelius still has his computer, and they engage in some funtime plotting but nothing comes of it.  And now, the next arc will be about that Russian they left in the woods  <em>who is still alive</em> .

      Hold on a sec, Mr. Teal says that the Boffin write-locked the diskette behind him.  But the diskette shown in  <em>Cornelius in the Cooler</em> , April 11, is clearly not write-protected!  More lies?  More games?  Circles within circles that we cannot hope to comprehend! <br/>

(Hey, kids.  Back in the 80s we had to write-protect diskettes by sticking tape over a hole in the side and write-enable disks using a hole-puncher.  It was pretty much stone knives and bearskins.)

      He was poisoned, shot four times, and then when he was trying to fight to his feet, he was beaten unconscious and ultimately tossed into an icy river where he died not from gunshot wounds, blunt trauma, or even drowning, but from hypothermia.  According to the autopsy, he should have been killed by the poison alone, so I think conspirator incompetence is pretty much ruled out.

      He was pretty much a badass. Supposedly he had a healing effect on that hemophiliac Romanov kid through hypnosis, and also led a lot of religious orgies which presumably altered the state of the participants' minds. Maybe he could, like, enter a trance state or something? That could somehow slow the harmful effects of poison or beatings or not breathing due to being immersed in water? <br/>

That doesn't make any sense, but his penis is on display in a penis museum, and it is  <em>ginormous</em> . Maybe he just had magical penis powers.

(The shirt is a shirt from a record store called Rasputin Music. It is not like I was like, "Oh sweet! Rasputin shirt! I can't believe they finally put my personal hero on something I can wear!"

      The rasputin penis was actually a sea cucumber, it was sold to a ladies drinking society in paris (yes yes, i know) and they allowed some sort of dick scientist to do a dna test on it, and found out that it wasnt a human penis.  <br/>

      I'm somewhat confused by this strip, but here's what I think happened. Cornelius understood perfectly that both Mr. Teal and the Publican were inventions of The Boffin, but remained appreciative of Roast Beef's efforts to amuse him through computational interactive fiction. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He's just kind of playing along with Mr. Teal in this strip. The "Heavens" in the first panel seems a bit patronising to me, but in an affably-intended way.

      Oh crap, you're right. Nevermind. Though Beef did go to heaven as well. Still, Blister doesn't seem like the most stand-up guy, and Lyle is a complex and sensitive man (tiger) on the inside. The Achewood god doesn't care about our petty human notions of decorum that say it's wrong to go to the bathroom on someone's favorite children's book.

      If you remove all of the panels in which Teal and friends are talking, this was an okay arc.  These paperclip characters just don't have any of the expressiveness of the rest of the anamorphic cast.  They don't physically exist, so they don't make gestures or facial expressions.  Even on the computer screen they never move or anything. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Another thing that doesn't help is that Teal only ever talks to Cornelius.  It's like Teal is his Hobbes or something. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If these paperclip helper characters keep popping up, well, then it's like some sort of dinosaur comics mini-strip inside of the larger achewood strip. [url=https://qwantz.com/]  Dinosaur comics is great, but just not nested inside of achewood strips.
