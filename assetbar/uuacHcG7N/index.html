      Well, perhaps, but that seems based in entirety on the presumption that Cornelius is  <em>not shocked out of his wits</em> .   <br/>

On the other hand, the image of the elderly being taken in by evil, surreal scams and not by simple ignorance is quite prevalent.

      I think you are missing something here which is very simple: teletrichopathy implies being able to feel or sense hair from a distance. Naturally, one would feel "dread" in Jamaica. There. Now that I've dissected that particular nugget, all the humour has run out of it.* <br/>

      In RE: Awesome Comments; wouldn't it be fun to have a collection of awesome comments? Make a little coffee table book out of it. "Achewood: Critical Review and MSPaint Commentaries." Dibs on 20% royalties to anyone who actually does this.

      Now if this were Ubuntu,  <em>that</em>  would be some magical realism.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Whenever I open the CD drive on my Ubuntu machine, a different Carole King album that I do not own comes out. When it first happened I joyfully told my wife the news. She started blathering about how it wasn't magical and that she had just bought the album the day before but I shoved her out of the way to get to a phone so I could call my sponsor and share the news with him. These days when I discover the magical albums I tell my wife and she gives me my medicine. I know she is selling them on eBay and when you have a computer that makes an infinite number of Carole King CDs I tell you boy that is money in the  <em>bank.<br/>

      Tell me about it. I've done tech support for a number of programs and the shit that I hear is insane. I understand that not knowing about computers and their magical inner workings doesn't make one stupid. However, not knowing anything about your computer and pretending you do to in a vapid attempt at not being made fun of by the tech you are talking to is damn stupid. Though in defense of the common non-computer literate person, most techs are complete fuck-wads.

      Though I don't necessarily like your rules, they are an excellent guide to avoid being lamed out of existence.  Lolcats are a guilty pleasure of mine I would never reveal to someone who knew what I was talking about.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
From a practical perspective, I would also add Rule Number 3 of Assetbar: Negative sentiments of any kind toward the comics or Onstad himself will NOT BE  TOLERATED.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Those three rules are a good way to advance yourself in the chubbeconomy.  If that's your kind of thing.

      You never, ever, ever are to use an en dash for a break in thoughts. It is purely used to separate dates. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Come on, man. Come on. It's a typographic device intended to INCREASE the ease with which one communicates, NOT be used to increase confusion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am not trying to be a dick about terms, yet I realize that is the case. Let us keep in mind that I would not even comment on an innocent, accidental discretion: however, given Theirateurk's displayed knowledge of the dash, I must let him know I do not approve of his breaking with convention in this case.

      In the end they realize that the author had the same debate with himself and came to what was already the best conclusion. <br/>

It sort of doesn't make sense, though... after all, why would he steal music that repulsed him? Why wouldn't he just steal music he likes?

      I think the moral of the story is that I finally understand what Onstad was trying to achieve yet; not caring whether anyone else does, combined with an inability to communicate my feelings lucidly, as well as fatigue mean that I will never share my innermost thoughts concerning panel six with anyone, ever again.

      I think I just realized the problem here. Onstad's grammar is indeed a bit off. The line should either be "stealing music  <em>that</em>  I would break from shackles to escape" or "stealing music, which I would break from shackles to escape". I'm fairly certain he meant the first thing.

      I am afraid not. He was making a commentary on the culture of the average PC buyer's taste in music. Seems unlikely he would bother breaking shckles to avoid stealing something, otherwise, he could happily stay shackled. Shackled people don't steal things.

      Come now. People joke about the Italian mafia all the time; but mention anything of the sort with jews and you're immediately labeled AS; even a fellow jew. :c( <br/>

      Ahem, if I may: <br/> 
A. Title of comic is Oregon trail 2008 <br/> 
B. A man named Hiram is involved <br/> 
C. The Hiram is a Blacksmith. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While any one of these, perhaps even two, could be considered coincidence, the simultaneous appearing of all three in a comic drawn by a man whom we already know reads Achewood('Geometry' shirt in one of Drew's videos)  would leave me to believe that this is no mere coincidence.  Additionally, if you actually played Oregon Trail, you would note that there is no Blacksmith-based interaction, therefore, assuming that two men who live on opposite sides of the country did not simultaneously invent a blacksmith named Hiram who was a character in a modernized update of the classic game "Oregon Trail," it's safe to say that, at the very least, the comic posted on Toothpastefordinner.com April 18, 2008 was inspired by the reading of the May 13, 2003 "Oregon Trail" storyline of the internet comic "Achewood".  <br/> 
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I rest my case. <br/> 
 <br/> 
PS: We know that the TFD Hiram was a blacksmith because in the olde days people used their blacksmith as a dentist, dentists hadn't been invented yet and blacksmiths had pliers and stuff.

      You have to picture a towering Cornelius shackled to the proscenium of Radio City Music Hall. <br/>

As tuxedoed swells gasp and society dames scream, sharp-elbowed pressmen nicknamed Scoot and Sparky lift their bulky, accordioning cameras. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Deanna Durbin in a cocktail gown flutters at them from the wings.  "Oh, stop! You awful men! Can't you see ... you're  <em>scaring</em>  him!  You're  <em>hurting</em>  him!" <br/>

But the flashes are a mere distraction.  It is the sound that drives Cornelius to wrench the prodigious iron staple from the floor. <br/>

      Real ones have a lot more hang and jiggle.  Fake ones are all round and stuffed looking.  The visual appeal is great, but in the clinch, medium to small ones are the most fun.  You just end up getting the big ones pinched somewhere and they are all flabby like.  They end up sagging to the belly button, too, at aroun 45.

      I also read "Watchmen" just a couple of months ago for the first time (didn't even know a movie was in the works) - a little dated, but good. A magnum opus, but, like many works that bite off a lot (2001 and The Stand come to mind), it sets up a premise that just can't be satifyingly resolved in the end.

      As we near the conclusion of this arc, I'd like to point out that the Boffin's wonderful skull is EXACTLY the same skull that adorns Lyle's shirt throughout the first couple years of achewood:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003250/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uuaf5Qrbj">exhibit A</a> . Maybe this has already been brought up, but I can only manage to read about 150 comments a day, and amidst all the chubbies being raised for the skull's sinister laughter, perhaps someone else will join me in wondering what the hell Lyle's been up to lately. I mean, it's not just the skull, but the porn, and the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003250/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua2bnmsZ">repeated</a>   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003250/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uuab6wGBB">fucking around with Cornelius</a> , and his level of  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003250/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua9VfLGW">comfort with computers</a> ... all these things kinda point to Lyle as the culprit, in my mind.

      Dudes. I respect what you're doing here, but I thought we all understood something about whether one should ever be a cock to a stranger. <br/> 
I have heard of the goddamn Misfits, and I get that that's Lyle's thing. Right. But the mere possibility that a particular skeletal graphic could be used in more than one context is what drove me to write this thought out. Is that so wrong? Actually listening to the Misfits is not my cup of tea. I make no bones about that. You guys rock on. But it makes me sad that you assume I'm ignorant about things.

Because I see achewood as  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003250/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=03142003">a celebration of the English language</a> , I will try to keep my musical snobbery to myself and instead attempt to use  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003250/https://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bon1.htm">fairly obscure idioms</a>  and wordplay while musing on the potentials of an intricately woven plot.

      Chill, man, don't get so defensive. There was nothing aggressive about my first comment, and after that we were just trying to see how long we could keep incorporating Misfits song titles into our posts (though now the chain is broken). Sorry if I incorrectly assumed that you didn't know the skull on Lyle's shirt was the Misfits logo - it just seems like if you had, you would've called it that instead of just calling it a skull graphic. Also, if the dictionary link was directed at me, it was unnecessary - I know what the idiom means. My comment was making a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003250/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=02262002">reference</a>  that you might have missed.

      An update for the rest of the Assetbears out there: seren-tremio and I are currently on our honeymoon. The wedding went beautifully, as planned, except for the fact that there was a stray cat in the back of the temple hacking and downing shot after shot of Cuervo. He kept offering the bottle to the bridesmaids and generally made a fool of himself. That tasteless cat had no right to mar our special day. Luckily, we had him taken away by Animal Control before the reception.

      I'm not sure if Cornelius' thoughts are true upon Roast Beef's intentions, but I can see where he's going. He wouldn't be privy to comprehend or have the patience for common-day computing troubles, like flamewars and music stealing. Therefore he believes that Roast Beef had led him to a computer that would give him an adventure that's modern, but would engage Cornelius on a level that he would understand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Our only hope is to see what Roast Beef has to say. Although I do feel bad for Cornelius. He's confused and is desperately trying to rationalize the situation.

      Meh. I don't hate The Simpsons, because that doesn't make sense, but I think that there's a very tangible difference in humour between their salad days and the most recent episodes. With the newer ones that I've seen, I tend to spend as much time frowning as I do laughing. <br/>

Which is why I stick to Futurama. Now there's a show that was consistently good.

      Remember that one Family Guy episode when Peter wins a trip to a brewery in a bit of a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fashion? They had him running home with his golden ticket, only to have him stub his toe and seete in pain for half a minute. That was pretty funny, until they began to pull that kind of gag all the time in an apparant bid to fill twenty two minutes of programming.  <br/>

This is what I mean by punishment gag; it's funny because you will sit there and watch it.

To me, this is no whisper - it is something where he leans forward, looks the other guy straight in the eyes like there is nobody else around, and articulates and stresses every word as though it is of global importance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As in: <br/>

"You don't like this strip? FUCK YOU." <br/>

      Don't be so pedantic.  We all know what he meant. <br/>

      I don't see how I'm being 'pedantic', by any definition of the word.  I was merely remarking on the irony of criticizing someone for expressing their opinion to those who expressed their opinion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mayhaps I read gmm's post as less 'fie on those who didn't like it' and more as 'poppycock! it's a good strip.' <br/> 
 <br/> 
If gmm's intent was, in fact, to flip the bird to those who found the comic lacking, then my original comment is entirely irrelevant.  In any event, fineoakstructure, I appreciate your civility and durable construction.

      I really don't want this to become an overlong argument (these new strips have too many comments as it is), but I do want to answer you: <br/> 
 <br/> 
It wasn't really ironic.  I didn't reply with a "BALLS"-like comment back to him.  I was a little frustrated, yeah, but he could have said he liked the strip without calling BALLS on the other people who didn't.  It  <em>is</em>  kind of a problem here.  Achilleselbow got tired of pointing that out; I haven't. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Intentional or not, that kind of comment is basically a "fuck you" to someone who didn't find this strip that good.  Pointing out that he didn't literally say "fuck you," which I obviously knew he didn't, seemed kind of pedantic to me.  You explanation above, less so...alright. <br/>

      Yeah. Cool, I get what you're getting at.  Given what I've stated though, I don't know why you're taking issue with what I've said.  I took his 'balls' post to mean 'pish posh' and not 'screw you, haters'.  The difference being that the first is just a way of saying he enjoyed the strip, while the second way is saying he doesn't like the people who dislike the comic.  If I had interperted it in the more derisive sense, I would have lamed him like a Power Glove. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I feel like we're really in agreement here, and I just can't find a way to convey what I would like to.

      As I've pointed out before, this is pretty much how Mr. Teal reacted to Cornelius's lukewarm feelings towards honey. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When I started posting, I used to get riled up about this and jump to the defense of people who have discerning opinions rather than those shirt-lifters who 5 everything in sight. But this was when I was silly enough to think that this board was actually for discussing the comic itself. But I've realized that, at least in practice, the board is there in order for the readers to take the material given by the strip as a starting point and run with it creatively and bounce ideas off each other, which in the end creates a collage of exchanges and detournements that not only end up being pretty damn funny a lot of the time, but more importantly exemplify a new kind of humor that can only be created with the multimedia capabilities of the Internet and through the unintentional collaboration of many simultaneous users. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So basically, the great thing about Achewood is that it packs so much into each strip that even if it's not funny in itself, it can still end up being a payoff for the community if it results in a completely unpredictable and hilarious comment thread. And if you look at it that way, commenting just to say "I didn't like this strip" adds nothing and only ruins the flow, unless you add some interesting reasons to facilitate discussion.

      Very good points, all.  And while you might consider that one way to look at AssetBar, it's not unreasonable to still think that this is ultimately a "comment on the strip" board.  It's probably why it was created, a lot of the original posts on the archived strips tend to be comments on the strip, the loose instruction is "Discuss," etc.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If someone wants to comment positively, let 'em.  If someone wants to comment negatively, let 'em, regardless of whether or not it adds to the creativity and, well, self-loving that goes on here.  There's shitloads of other comments on here that "interrupt the flow" that aren't negative and add nothing to the discussion.  As long as someone ain't trolling it up, it doesn't seem a bad idea to just try to not be dicks to them unnecessarily.

You're not thinking about the [url=https://https://achewood.com/index.php?date=05082002]milk & eggs minder[/url] program are you?  Otherwise, try using google to search the blogs... sometimes I search for something in a comic that never existed in a comic because I read it in the blogs instead.  There's  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220003250/https://rbeef.blogspot.com/2004/07/hw.html">this</a>  blog entry.  If you were drunk and/or high when you first saw that strip you are looking for, it will probably help you to find it more easily if you get drunk/high again.  Hope this helps...

      I believe this is a book/subscriber strip only.  Young Showbiz gets a computer and Beef gets one of those kind of hats the French Foreign Legion used to wear (baseball cap with neck cape or something). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've seen it because I have the book it's included in (as extra content); I don't know if the subscriber strips are searchable; I'm guessing probably not.

      This also reminded me of the other "special" strip (which I think is/used to be available as a subscriber "preview" strip): the "I Dig Boners" strip.  Man I'd give that a 5 if I could.

      Yeah absolutely.  Cornelius is supposed to be interrupting the current topic of the conversation in order to change to a new topic.  He does this with the phrase "At any rate."  If this were a book, it might be narrated ["At any rate," Cornelius bruskly interrupted...]  If this were a modern TV sitcom, then we would hear the interruption in his tone of voice.  But of course you can't convey tone of voice so easily in a comic strip with dialogue balloons.  It's even more difficult because they're sitting in a car, so you're limited as far as using physical posturing and gesturing for their expression.  It's all the more difficult given that Cornelius speaks in a very formal English of yore whose patterns of expressivity don't jive with that of the other characters nor with the reading interpretation of the contemporary audience. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, ya got to admire Onstad for taking on this kind of challenge.  I don't think this instance was his best work, but overall, these continual juxtapositions of heterogenious ideas and characters in the dialogue and in the story are what give this strip such an expansive range and texture.  Look at most other strips out there - few of them even attempt this.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think if the art for panels 1 and 5 were reversed, then the transition from panel 4 to 5 might have worked a lot better, especially if in panel 5 Tedor and/or ray had some kinda facial expression indicating that they were being interrupted and/or following Cornelius' resumption of the topic he started in panel 1.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's cool that the strip ends with a panel only showing Cornelius, therefore leaving it up to the reader to imagine Tedor & Ray's reaction and/or lack thereof to Cornelius' dialogue.  That is just awesome.  Onstad is forcing some of the creative work onto the reader - this is how it should be - this is part of how these characters achieve so much range and become so real.

      Well actually, I saw it as: Cornelius heard Ray's "whisper" (see: heccibiggs, a few threads up), and couldn't be arsed to get all worked up or even comment on Ray's assuption of his senility, so I guess you could say that the "Stanley" bit was what he was interrupting.

      I think this may have been a case if Onstead being pressed for time, in regards to the last three panels. It was necessary to have a strip that was largely exposition, and Ray was there to throw out a joke to help it go down easier. Not trying to be a dick, but I think you are reading a little too much into it.

      Yeah it does feel rushed.  It could also be that Onstad wasn't rushed, but that he simply knows his own characters better than us, and so he visualizes their natural flow of conversation more easily, so what to us seems rushed or disjointed to him seems natural and normal.  I think also that even if he might be aware that the flow of the dialogue or of the story might not present well or neatly, I think he might just prefer to present it as is, without prettying it up, just to be true to the form and the story and the characters.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wonder how the story and characters might evolve over time if Onstad's motivation evolved... I wonder how any of y'all might have observed Onstad's motivation to be evolving, if at all?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's sure a different experience, anyway, to read the strips day by day, and also to see them picked apart in Acheworld, rather than to simply read them straight through one after the other.  For me sometimes it seems to take away some of the spontaneous joy of reading the strips, when I read other's lengthy metatations on them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wonder if I shouldn't read them one story arc at a time, rather than one strip at a time.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the flip side, imagine reading the strips one panel at a time... with a new panel released every 6 to 12 hours or so.

      Actually, that would be pretty awesome. Imagine just getting the first panel, and being all just "What the fuck?". However, imagine how congested the Assetbarrio would be, with all the speculation going on. I guess that would be counterbalanced by the fact that people would only have a couple of hours to post before the next panel comes up.
