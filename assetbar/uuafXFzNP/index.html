      A high-ranking Mombasa councilman had Brian Wheat's sister's brain removed and placed in a jar. The sister's body was then stored in a salt water solution. The brain jar was placed in a fake laboratory used as background detail for the councilman's yearly Mombasa's Most Haunted Hayride celebration. The jar was upended by a thirsty pony and the brain was licked multiple times by pony tongue. Everyone agreed that this year's Mombasa's Most Haunted Hayride celebration was the best one of all.

      The first time I read this strip, I didn't see the .exe file in the previous strip, so I assumed that Leon never actually proved his identity when he said "as has been proven." That actually served to make this strip even more awesome.

      once the shunts are in place can't they just be left there, if they move just apply some light gauge stucco mesh and thin mixed plaster. Paint immediately for a durable fresco coat. Allow to dry 18 hours before applying a second coat. Any hung fixtures should be installed with anchors. I'm dusty and this has been another addition of these old legs.

      Leon's English is far too good to be natural.  People in general suck at their native tongue more than people who learned it. Today in psych class we read a handout on psychopathy.  It was from some hella reputable source...yet it used the word 'disapprovalment.' I laughed and then i cried.

      "Around the clock shunting" reminds me of Hunter S. Thompson's  <em>Hell's Angels.</em>  There's a passage where Hunter is hanging out with the bikers, camping somewhere, and one of the bikers inexplicably becomes obsessed with the word "shunt" and walks around asking people "Hey, what would you do if I said I was going to shunt you?"
