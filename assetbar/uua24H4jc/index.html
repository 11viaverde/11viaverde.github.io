But things happen, man. People open doors even though it is night time and they are clearly closed. It doesn't make you as stupid as a five year old if you get caught.. unless you're diddling under the kitchen table at dinner, in which case there are probably bigger issues than stupidity at hand.

      The only time I was ever caught was by my best friend when we were about nine. He snuck down the stairs. He was trying to catch me at something. Maybe he wanted to catch me stealing from him, which I never did do even though his parents were loaded and he had tons of rad shit to steal. Maybe he wanted to catch me crushin' the Russian to Victoria's Secret in his basement, which I did do pretty often. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He yelled "You're gross" and ran upstairs and wouldn't make eye contact with me for about an hour. Then we went into the woods and made machine gun noises while pointing sticks at trees.

      Hm, good points. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Philippe may be too young to understand the finer points of christian sectarianism. He probably believes in Mom and God, in that order, with the Pope coming a distant third. As it should be.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And perhaps the animal community has its own version of Jolly Jack Chick who writes illustrated hate-screeds from a Ratzinger perspective... <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nope, just checked, and  <em>Gomez Worships Idols</em>  is one of the tracts he was sent.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe Philippe's Mom is slipping, and has simply forgotten which flavour of Christ she prefers. Or she attends all the local churches, just to be on the safe side.  <br/>

      No. In Catholicism, at the moment, unbaptised babies 'maybe' go to heaven. Otherwise they go to limbo. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Limbo doesn't seem that bad to me (eternal happiness and contentment apparently), but if you're into this kind of this, then you're going to want your dead child to be in God's presence, and experiencing perfect joy - if it wasn't bad enough he kills your baby, he wont even own up to it and let them on the top table. What a prick.

      The infamous Centurion-die, commonly referred to as the D100. The D100 is a dual-edged sword in the D&D community, and many of its players have a sort of terrified-but-awed respect for it. <br/>

Very few have been unavailingly fortuitous with the die and have reaped tremendous D&D fortune from it, but countless others have fallen victim to the merciless Centurion-die.

      Uh, I'm pretty sure he's complaining about the comic in general (I think this guy has been doing this a bit lately), and I assume that his talk about this other comic "having an update today, too" was meant as a jab at Onstad's general tendency towards not producing strips as often as he used to. <br/>

Maybe I'm wrong.  I...I'm not sure if I care anymore.

      There is a scene I remember from  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted"><em>2001</em></span> , just after the focus of the film shifts to the Odyssey, where either Frank Poole or Bowman are playing tic-tac-toe with HAL. Possibly right before or after the part where Bowman is running around the ring with that gorgeous tracking shot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Clarke also mentioned in the book that HAL played chess with Bowman and Poole and was "instructed" to lose half of the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But a heck of a catch Troy's memory made, picking out that one brief moment from the forest of byzantine eye-fuckery that  <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted"><em>2001</em></span>  is.

      Cal, how can you tell it's not the Marinov Opening countered with a modified Reczi defense? Can you tell for sure that he is playing X-first? After all, it's not impossible that he painted himself into a corner by messing up the defense scheme with the X, rather than sticking to the correct set of moves.  <br/>

You're giving him too much credit. He is five, after all.

      I presume from the lack of hyphens between the words on the paper (Tic Tac Toe as opposed to Tic-Tac-Toe) that he's playing the Standardized American version, in which Circle always leads, in which case the Marinov Opening would be incredibly hazardous, due to the tendency for Cross to immediately capture the North-East square and force an early resignation. If you truly believe I'm giving him too much credit, look again at the piece of paper, and remember he is playing against himself. Toe is four moves away but its there, he has it.

      That's what his girlfriend desires, his wife is uninterested in it. He let's her have her way because he's afraid that otherwise she'll tell his wife about his mistress, and if they were to meet they would probably be able to work out between their combined knowledge that he has a second family, and once that got back to his girlfriend all hell would break loose.
