      Hell yes. the one and only time I ever tried it, I was fine...until my buddies dragged me to a barbeque sandwich restaurant and I started moving from table to table every second, despite standing totally still. I was freaking out and panicking, but not for what others might think of me. I was like "I DO NOT LIKE THIS I NEED TO GO HOME AND DO LAWN CHORES GODDAMMIT" or my Grandmother who was dead would be angry.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
If that is a party then it is the nazi party. Never again. <br/>

      I would tell you to just get back on the horse. I would tell you that such a reaction is extremely rare and usually just happens the first few times, if at all. But I am reminded of a friend of mine who has tried to smoked probably no fewer than twenty times and on every single occasion had to basically be talked out of calling an ambulance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm all trying to watch  <em>Miller's Crossing</em>  and he's all getting in front of me, plaintively looking into my eyes, "Robby....Robby I'm dying. I'm serious. I can feel myself dying, man." Here's a guy who can drink me under the table, but one hit of weed and he's writing up his will. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are some people who's bodies just don't handle it well, ever. You may be one. Though, I may suggest that bong rips are not really the ideal means of initiation. If you ever get up the nerve again, try just one small hit to start with. Ease into it.

      Evidently not.  You'll just have to suffer with your ~4000 chubbies, I guess. <br/>

Spinynorman is a very funny guy, of course...but I suppose I still stand by my mild criticism above.  Alert the media.

      You neglect to mention the 4000 comments it took to get those 4000 chubbies. Spinynorman probably had 4000 after, like, three.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
And my comment above shouldn't be taken as an indictment of the validity of his stories. I don't really have an opinion either way. And even if they are slighty.... <em>embellished,</em>  they make for a pretty good read a lot of the time and that's better than most people do here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end, I've come to think of that Stephen Fry avatar as a reason to stop scrolling and start reading - increasingly prevalent spinynorman backlash be damned.

      I think I'm on a "chubby per post" average, as well, though still far fewer chubbies than 4000.  The tears, they do come, but they are not often. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah, I don't want to make it sound like I have a beef with the guy.  Defintely one of those "favorite" assetbar posters that deserves all the nods.  I think I posted my original comment after strolling at random through the archives, and just noticing a trend in several of spiny's longer stories (crazy/drunk friends, exceedingly unique individuals with sordid pasts that come and go in a flash, etc.), and it was starting to wear a little thin on me.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's increasingly prevalent anti-spinynormania comments on assetbar?  Really?  I can't remember any.  I think there was one other time last year that I called him the A-Rod of assetbar, which was supposed to be a (jokingly) negative comment, but now I don't really know what I even meant by it.

      The stuff I use is called Rohto V.  It comes in a clear, round bottle with a green cap.  It makes your eyes tingle in kind of a minty way (so don't use them while driving... uh.) but they clear that shit RIGHT up. <br/>

      Rohto's are so goddamned painful. I use Opcon because it works without the pain. My friend used to have these Rohto Arctic, or some shit, they were called, I remember they had a silver lid instead of the green or blue lid the normal kind has, and the bottle said that the eyedrops produced a cooling sensation. In your eyes. My friend convinced me to try them and it's basically a lot like going temporarily blind. Actually exactly like going temporarily blind, because temporarily you go blind

      I had always been too shy to chubby and in a moment of boldness I decided that this post was worth a chubby.  It is with great shame that I report that in the moment of truth I missed chubby and hit lame instead.

      You know, it always vaguely bugged me that Nightlife kinda broke his perfect hep cat vernacular in that last panel, but really, there's only one way to say "the sign will be that life is awesome" and that's, uh, the way he said it.  So NEVER MIND I suppose
