      my great uncle once told me about he was in a strip club in veitnam and i guess if you put a beer bottle on the stage platform the girl would come over and  <em>insert it without using her hands</em> , anyway he said he accidentally set his ice cold beer on the stage, a girl came over and shoved it right up her cooter and i guess she didnt like it cause he still has a dent in his head were she broke the bottle on him. true story.

      This is a perfect question for an old-timer like me.  Yes, Another Doll, it is all about the tightness.  A penis is not actually all that sensistive in the touch or warmth department, but it can really feel pressure, being basically a balloon filled with blood.  So the tight twat wins the praise.  [Sidenote: Women who have only delvireed children through Cesarian operations tend to maintain tightness all their lives.  Discuss the implications.]

      Which brings up a question: <br/> 
 <br/> 
If the above disturbing comment from Pogo indicates a male's preference for vaginas, what of a bi/lesbo/whathaveyou lady's preference? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would assume that, for the chicks what do other chicks, it would come down to look, taste, and cleanliness (all three of which are surely interconnected).  This is going from my personal taste in punani, when thought from a purely no-dick-involved perspective. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not sayin' that that's all a fella or a dame would be looking for - obviously, the actual person is most important, don't split hairs with me.  Nonetheless, surely a preference must enter into all participating individual's minds, with some worried about it more than others. <br/> 
 <br/> 
From a purely girl's bits perspective: what do the femmes that prefer, prefer?

      there was this outta the way bar in Camarillo called "Gold Street". inside, it resembled the bar in patrick swayze's ass kicking flick "Roadhouse". <br/> 
 <br/> 
the bartendar was the spitting image of Huey Lewis. He wore this sweatband which made appear more 80's than someone who already looks like Huey should go for. <br/> 
 <br/> 
anyways, he'd do this cool thing whereby he's open your twist off bottle with his forearm. he'd just jam into the muscle, flex and twist.  <br/>

he was big too. could prolly kick huey's, ramses and swayze's ass all at once.

      That bottle cap is going to end up in Pat's plate of faux-fu (it's for the tofu intolerant). Pat doesn't eat tofu because it's production is threatening the habitat of the red-legged snipe in Virgiia. The red-legged snipe feeds primarily on the green armor beetle. An armor beetle once flew into Pat's hair, so he's now aligned with the snipe.

I think the whole "chicks dig assholes" cliche comes from the fact that women (and, let's face it, men too) are attracted to confidence, and confidence is easily mistaken for assholism. The reverse holds true as well, which is why some people really do end up with total jerks. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just know what other women have told me, though... since you actually deal with these sorts of guys I imagine you've probably got one up on me.

      I don't think we're contradicting each other. I would just add that becoming a "spineless sycophant" makes you undesirable not just because you lack the attractive force of confidence, but also because you usually end up being all passive aggressive and clingy while simultaneously congratulating yourself for being morally superior to other men. What's really annoying is that those "nice guys" often also see themselves as morally superior to their desired girl, whom they view as cruelly leading them on (when they might well just be seeing what they want to see) and as using them for conversation/emotional support without sleeping with them (as if a platonic friendship were a carefully plotted punishment). A dude who does that is not the same as the stereotypical asshole who cheats, beats, or mistreats, but he is still a brand of asshole, which is the real reason he doesn't get dates.

      No, now that you put it that way I can see that we're saying pertty much the same thing, though I've never looked at it in those terms before. <br/>

Next time I talk to one of "those guys" whining about being lonely, I think I'll share this perspective with them. Every guy knows one of "those guys" and we hate listening to them spill angst everywhere too.

      Ya.. I'm gonna speak up too.  As a chick who's only ever dated "Nice" guys-  No guy is ever as "nice" as he believes himself to be.  Every guy (and chick, I'll be honest) either hides that asshole bit of their personality, or doesn't quite realize their asshole-ness.. it only comes out through time, and through the test of a relationship.  So therefore, everyone is nice, everyone is an asshole, and the world all balances out.

      Usually, it comes with encounters with dudes with reasonably attractive girlfriends, whom they tell one to many insensetive jokes about that are grudgingly tolerated. <br/>

There are plenty of legitimately nice people who are alone, but the reason isn't because they're too nice.  More than likely, they're just boring as hell. <br/>

      I'm curious as to how that came up. Did Ramses just go over and tell him that out of nowhere, or were they having a conversation that just naturally led there?

      No no no Ramses is not talkin about "his schools" as in the schools that his people, the cats of flesh and blood, attend, he is actually just gettin in a plug for his latest side-project called Ramses Luther's Cuffs n' Cookin' Martial Arts and Culinary Charter School for Children, located off Route 1 between XXX Live Nudes XXX and Lysander's Rib Shack where you can specialize in <br/> 
 <br/> 
- kickin asses <br/> 
- dough hook attachments <br/> 
- kickin asses with dough hook attachments <br/> 
 <br/> 
So you see guys this is not about racism this is just about Ramses wantin to preserve his people's  <em>way of life</em>  and robots would eventually start teachin children about math and logic and Big Bang Theory and us down South believe God created the Earth in seven days by saying that he did, not by havin sex with the universe that is mega-nasty man that is dog shit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Teachin is a job that should not be outsourced to Robot Russia man we got enough Ferrignos takin our jobs <br/>

      last night in bed when i was half-asleep i was thinking about this for some reason. if robots ever got human enough, and there was a crusade for their civil rights, it would make me feel weird. and then wouldn't that make me as bad as people who deny other minority groups equal rights? but  <em>robots</em> , man, the whole idea is that they ain't  <em>really</em>  human. i was getting really torn up about it, in that way that things make you vaguely distressed when you're partly drunk. then i was like, well what would qualify "human enough," and what makes "human"  <em>human</em> , and then my boyfriend told me he didn't believe in free will and i got kind of belligerent.  <br/>

i got a c in cognitive science.

      Yeah, I guess it is pretty good, but you know I ain't got no sense of computers. It has the Awesome Bar, which lives up to its name pretty well, but other than that, it hasn't really revolutionized my browsing experience.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It fucks up Assetbar something fierce. When you hover over an avicon, the little popup display box appears like fifty times all tiled over itself, and then that big block won't go away until you navigate away from the page. Sometimes it covers the reply button or similar, which is really inconvenient. However, hovering your mouse over an avicon is necessary to get rid of those big random chunks of black or gray that sometimes randomly appear on Assetbar. It's a trade-off concocted by Beelzebub himself. <br/>

Also, RIP my cool swoopy tab-switching add-on that isn't compatible with FF3.

      Some have argued that FF3 is the best in the series, with its truly compelling storyline and its ability to push the 16-bit hardware to its limits. Perhaps the last great RPG of the 16-bit generation before the onset of 32-bit, with the exception of  <em>Chrono Trigger</em> .

      I always assumed most current assetbar posters would die in or around 2011, which is when I assume the edit feature will be introduced. Those who don't go into shock immediately will spend the rest of their days hovering over each and every post they've made, forgoing food and sleep in order to fix the odd typo or grammatical error, lest they look a fool.

      Hard to say. Edwell has never posted much in a graphical sense beyond particularly well-done Photoshop manipulations of artwork produced by others. As someone with experience in both art and image editing, I'd say the latter is a lot easier (by several degrees of magnitude) than the former. He is probably better than Onstad at using Photoshop, and it's likely he has some artistic talent, but there's no way to really gauge the comparative quality from the work heretofore posted. <br/>

      I figured some people wouldn't like it because it's out of character for Phillipe. And it's not really the out-of-character way Onstad writes him, like being a selfish brat or showing surprising intelligence. It's more planned out and malicious than Phillipe is known to be.

      That is probably the best opening of a beer bottle throuhgh exhalation that I have ever seen! Not only did the cap not suffer any bending or denting, as if it had been crowbarred off by the most skillful of pixie catburglars, but the foam also took a split second to gush out, as the complete subtlety of the action took it completely unawares! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm giving it a 5/5. We'll have to hear Beer Bottle Opening Monthly's verdict, of course. I'd send it to them, but I'm sure they have their own sources.

      He had only stopped by for their usual coffee, perhaps a brief conversation about feminism, ribbing in the form of accusations to one another of how they had both failed to uphold their ideals. He would call her a slut and she would call him a chode and they would both laugh it off, watch a BBC adaptation of a Jane Austen novel and make fun of it along the way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But when he walked in through loneal's door that night, professorhazard found her asleep on her sofa, an empty box of tissues on the coffee table. He picked up the remote and turned on the television, and the sound of Jim Lehrer's Southern twang announcing the news of this Friday roused her suddenly. She blinked the sleep out of her eyes and in the light from the television professorhazard finally noticed the redness around them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Hey," he said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Hey," she said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"What's the matter," he stated more than asked. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He sat down beside her, keeping his distance, thinking of pamphlets he'd read in eighth grade health class so many years ago that said the worst thing you can do in a situation where a woman is telling you she has been recently raped is to make physical contact in an attempt to comfort her but wait why am I assuming she has been raped my mind is full of soap operas and Lifetime original movies pay attention and listen to her man... <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Lainestin left me," she said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Professorhazard couldn't deny how glad he felt, though he hid it well. Lainestin was probably the worst thing that had ever happened to her. It was lainestin who took every thing she said -- every proudly held conviction she had that had made professorhazard proud to know her -- and twisted it into a lie. At many a party had he stood by and watched her lovingly lean on his shoulder while all he could do was stare into space and sip a PBR. Never paid any attention to her, always too busy with his "art" -- the paintings derivative of Van Gogh that filled up their garage not being sold but what did professorhazard know about art he was an engineer "it's just not your training" as lainestin would say and loneal nodding, looking at professorhazard for just a brief second thinking that he had a point before thoughts of lainestin laming her crept into her mind reminding her whose she was  <em>though of course she would never put it that way</em>  their love was a poison and lainestin was an arrogant, selfish prick just dragging her down and professorhazard knew it but nothing could be more arrogant than to speak up about it right? Try to step in and live loneal's life for her? Surely she would hate that. But inaction accomplished nothing and so did thinking that being a friend meant never calling someone on their bullshit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But she looked up at him and then away and he felt her shame, not just from letting him see her in such pain but the mixture of desire and despair behind it.  <br/> 
He had suppressed his lust for her for so long. That alone was not enough to move him forward but now it was the thinking that it was more her need than his own desire that enabled him, had him thinking of himself not as an agent but as a means to her reclaiming some sense of identity, her orgasm only a reminder that she was alive and that she belonged to herself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And so when he pulled her clothes off he told himself that his arms were now an extension of her body, and as he lamed her softly thinking damn how is lainestin such a fool to leave such a tight comment behind lamed her softly thinking that he was no different than anything in her bedroom nightstand that she would use after any break-up, licking her the way she would have licked the rocky road ice cream she'd kept for previous depressing occasions. He very nearly chuckled into her pussy upon remembering how she hated herself for having this ice cream crutch for it was such an obvious cliche for a woman left broken by a man to resort to comfort food, letting go of control of her body both sexually and nutritionally due to the whims of missing-dick syndrome. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Professorhazard lamed the tight wetness of her comment felt her tightening and pulling distracting him making him stop thrusting but no don't stop for that would ruin the illusion she must not let it seem like her body wants the lame but it must continue on like a scene in a movie from the forties first the passionate kiss then the inevitable slap, a sin committed eagerly and recanted on the deathbed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He lamed her and his body belonged with hers, belonged  <em>to</em>  her and that thought kept his dick hard and his balls big and round. He must prolong the illusion that he is here to help her masturbate never mind the nails digging into  <em>his</em>  back remember her eyes are closed she must be thinking of the fool who left her well let her think whatever she wants to think and the good long cock will provide for if he actually lets himself think that she is thirsting for him then he will catch feelings just as so many hoes in so many rap songs catch feelings then how will he give her her revenge on men if I have to be that for her I will be that for her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He held her down and lamed her and came inside and she kissed and licked his face and then buried her face in his shoulder and he knew they would not look at each other no he would get hard again and lame her again and fill the wet tightness of her comment and then he would leave before morning but when he did all that and didn't leave before morning he decided she was renting him yes he was a rental for her and so he lamed her again as the sun rose and as she showered he was certain it was time for him to go but it was like she heard him creeping off and she shouted over the noise of the water "Are you hungry" and he responded "Yes" and since they had managed to talk without looking each other in the face it was okay and by the time she was dressed he was already in the car staring straight ahead waiting and when she climbed in they drove without talking to iHop said nothing to each other had the Rooty Tooty Fresh n' Fruity came back and said nothing and in bed this time just as she turned her head towards him closed her eyes again and he lamed her well that afternoon and the rental continued past the return date and knew that yes this is fine I will let her objectify me if I can be that for her I will be that for her if I can be that for her I will be that for her if I can be that for her I will be that for her if I can be that for her I will be that for her...

      No, keep it "missing-dick syndrome".  I think it's much more apt and effective.  "phantom" brings to my mind the "phantom pains" that amputees sometimes get--implying that your character once had a dick but lost it but still feels like she has it.  A very different meaning from "missing-dick", which I think here is much more apropos.  and funnier.

      Agent Pogo! My office, now! <br/> 
 <br/> 
*door slams* <br/> 
 <br/> 
You're a loose cannon, Pogo! Accusing one of the favorite Assetbar babes of being one of you know who's proxies? Did you even think to run a basic profile check first? 226 comments, Pogo, 226 fucking comments! Jesus Christ, man! <br/> 
 <br/> 
*sigh* <br/> 
 <br/> 
Look, Pogo, I know you've been effective in the past. Hell, that's why I bailed you out of that mess you were in with Internal Affairs. You're good at what you do. I respect that. And we need agents like you keeping vigilance. But if we're gonna start rounding up innocent people...well, shit, then he's already won.

      i had a dream last night that Ramses wrote a full-length graphic novel about his own experience in the great outdoors fight, but had left the cover blank except for the title "a Fine Piece of Literature" because at that point in the dream i thought ramses's initials were FPL then i realized they were not, so the title changed to "Real Life Story" <br/> 
 <br/> 
then i made the unfortunate but but understandable decision of opening the book, saw ramses face staring me down from the inside jacket, and i was scared awake

      I post on a totally different persona over there.  I'm nice, and respectful, and treat women like equals.  It's a limey comic, so it seems more fitting really.  They are such fun little people over there. <br/>

      Yes wife, and no, she prefers the OTHER kind of girls, so she won't be playing with you.  You should be thankful, she's got a mean streak and her hands are  <em>cold</em> .  Like I said, it's a big house, and if there isn't someone crying in every room in feels kinda empty you know.  If you are feeling unloved, I'll introduce you to the other girls if you want.  Be careful with the redhead, she's not actually a girl in the technical sense.

I stopped buying them after their "style corner" said:  <em>"No one looks good in a fedora anymore-<strong>no one.</strong>"</em> <br/>

      I dislike GQ for assuming that I am interested in a product just because it has leather trimming. Every edition seems to be suggesting that I buy some rubbish like a �2000 special edition zippo with Frank Sinatra's face embossed on the leather case, which is soaked in cologne. They don't know me. <br/>

      little known fact: if done properly you can open beer with your teeth.  You shift your jaw slightly to the left and put your canine in the middle of the cap (acts as the fulcrum) - you use the two teeth you shifted it over to brace and then you simply tilt the bottle up.

      Dear PEERS <br/> 
 <br/> 
As it is late Sunday, these comments will soon be lost to time like tears in the rain, so forgive me this message to those who might give a shit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Recently, I have begun working with some amount of vigor on a comic over at  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090917115808/https://www.snipehuntmedia.com/">my website</a> . Not unlike Achewood, I have adopted the fashion of simply showing the latest comic on the main page (although I have, thus far, avoided the total ripoff pleasure of self-commentary through alt text), so if you'd like to read it from the first page, click  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090917115808/https://www.snipehuntmedia.com/database/archives/snipehunt/snipehunt001.shtml">here</a> . Anyways, we're up to the fifth page now, and I think things are really coming along. Since I love Achewood and you guys do too, I consider your opinions to be totally valid, since for the most part we like the same things. Thus, some feedback on how it is coming along would be most appreciated. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Please note that this is in no way an attempt to steal any thunder from Achewood. It is merely an attempt to see if people whose opinions I respect think my work cuts the mustard - or the cheese.  <em>Ho ho ho, a fart joke.</em>

      Interesting, I had visited your site earlier today through you profile, and now you direct link it. <br/> 
I had interpereted it as an abandoned work before, so that's nice to know. <br/>

      So far, so good.  First and foremost, I like the art style of the comic itself, although the low-res (and, frankly, low-rent) retro styling of the navigational menu on the left is incongruous with the cartoon.  With regard to the comic itself, though, I thought the 2nd through 4th strips did good job of building the drama.  The cinematography, so to speak, works well; your use of close-ups and choice of "camera angles" were great.  I can't tell whether this cartoon is going to be funny or serious (or both); I think you could reasonably go in either a comedic or a dramatic direction from here.  The moment of truth, I suppose, will arrive when you introduce some dialogue.

I'd say the site design turns on as many people as it turns off; possibly more of column A than column B. But hey, you like the comic, and that's what matters.

      Huh. I wonder what other Assetbarians besides Tekende and now the Prof. have webcomics of their own. I keep planning to start one with my friend and we have a few strips outlined, but we've run into some delays in agreeing on a good name and finding/making a website, since both of us have no sense of coding.
