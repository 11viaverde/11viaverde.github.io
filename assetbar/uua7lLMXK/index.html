      I say Onstadt can edit to his heart's delight until the book comes out and it's a bone fide commercial item.  Why the hell not?  The beauty of the medium is its flexibility, and what author doesn't wish he could go back and fix the little niggly things that mar an otherwise decent effort?  But sure, fuck the fanboys.  He should do it for his own satisfaction.

      <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>There will only be one. And it won't be what I would call the "rough cut," it'll be the "final cut." The other one will be some sort of interesting artifact that people will look at and say, "There was an earlier draft of this." The same thing happens with plays and earlier drafts of books. In essence, films never get finished, they get abandoned. At some point, you're dragged off the picture kicking and screaming while somebody says, "Okay, it's done." That isn't really the way it should work. Occasionally, [you can] go back and get your cut of the video out there, which I did on both American Graffiti and THX 1138; that's the place where it will live forever. So what ends up being important in my mind is what the DVD version is going to look like, because that's what everybody is going to remember. The other versions will disappear. Even the 35 million tapes of Star Wars out there won't last more than 30 or 40 years. A hundred years from now, the only version of the movie that anyone will remember will be the DVD version [of the Special Edition], and you'll be able to project it on a 20' by 40' screen with perfect quality. I think it's the director's prerogative, not the studio's to go back and reinvent a movie.</em></div>  -- G. Lucas <br/> <br/> <br/> What an asshole.

      star wars was good until the 3 newest movies.  The original 3 movies were creations of mostly one or a few people, drawing on their own personal experience and culture.  The latest 3 movies were made by giant companies, the decision making process was obviously driven by committee consensus and focus group, and the result was that the shittiest aspects of our contemporary shitty culture mar the films completely, starting with Jar Jar Binks as some kind of fucking blackface nigger stereotype, as if this was a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018000217/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looney_Tunes#Stereotypes">1930's era looney toons </a> cartoon.  However the negative impact that the racial and gender role stereotypes has on these films pales in comparison to the stereotyping of the intended audience as lap dog consumers of another mindless Disney-esque sugar and alcohol and 4/20 fueled addiction liquid-group-think-cartoon-by-committee and happy-meal-toy-by-market-research moving picture 'experience.'  Okay, so some stereotypes are accurate after all...

      Actually IIRC it was sorta the opposite. For the first three Lucas and co. came in with all kinds of retarded bullshit ideas about how Luke Skywalker was going to have a robot head and shit, and a limited budget and the kind of close corporate oversight that's normal when dealing with a nobody director forced him in the end to come out with something marginally normal and sane. Once Lucas made everyone a kazillion dollars nobody was going to interfere with The Genius's creative vision (I mean seriously who are you picturing even trying to push Lucas around over some market demographics, in 1999), so he got absolute control over every creative aspect of his films, and with infinite budget and creative freedom to create whatever he wanted what he created was sewage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You can see the exact same thing with The Matrix, or Avatar. Horrible directors (or maybe once-good ones, who knows) cruelly forced by The System to produce passable films, that get them a ton of money and fame which the directors then blow on cinematic war crimes once left to their own devices. Big business are actually the good guys here.

Actually im just think of the discussion of Tambourine Man in Dangerous Minds (1995 Michele Pfeiffer). But it has happened. I just cannot think of more examples right now.

      It troubles me that people think that Pete's roleplay and murder are mutually exclusive. Troubles me, it does. I mean, sure, maaybe he's not going to kill anyone tonight, but that doesn't mean the man's never made a young man dress as a Chemus Witch going to the Market and put an axe in his neck in the same night. If Pete's gonna ice somebody, he's gonna put it into a story, and make it part of the character. Dude's of southern ways but doesn't mean he's of a low mind or has no artistic bearing.

      I wouldn't be surprised if Nathan were already dead. Dead because the naked man who appeared to show enough kindless and generosity to a sexually starved elderly homosexual man should happen to be a madman in the midst of a delusional time-warp'd plot upon which Nathan had the misfortune to stumble. One which held sexual undertones to the unsuspecting eye, yet which promised only the violence of a twisted mind to any lured to the scene, through lust, fear, or perhaps both, many have the potential to fall folly. Such is life. Achewood serves as a warning to those traveling the underbelly of existence for thrills, and as an entertainment for sleepless entertainment dwellers.

      We All standing next to that dusty, old country road.. <br/> 
The one your parents drove down to take your childhood dog to the Millet's farm cos Sadie couldn't stop piddling on the floor? The blue-green of the windswept grass catches your eye, bowing to and fro in the breeze. Then, there is a glint of shine from County Road 46! It shimmers for a sec, causing you to squint before it disapears under the next rise; trail of dust lazily wafting across the fruited plain, wont to join its pristine brothers in the cerulean heavenlies but found lacking. You continue to stare in its direction for such a duration you'd be sure to see the vehicle again. Alas. Your hair is ruffled by the increased wind sending a small chill down your spine. Focusing on the fencing you lean on, your thoughts turn to admiration of the amount of labor put in to keep barbed wire up, cattle in and coyotes out. Your eyes follow the line of fenceposts along the road, until suddenly a roar of a taxed engine is present. An instant later, a white workvan appears, cracked windshield, missing left headlight and all..that's left of it. An arguement of where to stop begins between the worn Bridgestones and the rocks underneath them. The vehicle has stopped in front of you. Silent. The same dust chasing the van now envelops you as you emit one single cough. The van's side doors swing open. It is too dark inside to see anything. Are there others besides the driver? Am I ready for what I signed up for? It's too late. It's time for Swim Practice, a male voice inside the vehicle says. You climb in.

      I think Teodor should be happy about these most recent developments. a) He now has a fat old man to cushion the van walls. b) There is someone else to do dares now for as long as Nathan lives. c) With all this practice he is definitely going to win the 'Ship now. -Cue the Rocky montage music-

      Well spotted, but I think it's an indication that Onstad wasn't looking too closely at the art he was re-using.  <br/>

      motu, motu...the most uncomfortable thing is to be at the dentist for fillings, and just after the dentist locks your mouth open and places 8 stainless steel ring clamps on your teeth, the smoke detector begins to beep that it is out of power. The dentist claims that he can't work with that distraction and gets a step ladder and starts to change the battery. Foam popcorn falls from the ceiling as he works and gets in your eyes and mouth which you can't close, you try to tell him but he can't understand you, so he turns to look, which makes him fumble and drop both the old and new 9 volt batteries, they bounce off of your face and lodge themselves against the clamps on your teeth. You sit up quickly and grab them out of your mouth, screaming, but your shoulder bumps the ladder causing in to tip over and the dentist lands on the side of it balls first, then tips over onto the floor and curls up in a ball. Still dazed, you get up and help him off the floor, and both of you realized at once that you have both peed your pants from pain. The dentist takes the jaw ratchet out of your mouth saying "damn, I mean holy fuck, ouch right?" then he leans over and puts his mouth by your ear and whispers "are you as fucking turned on as I am right now?"

      Back when Onstad first wrote those early, heartwarming scripts in which Mr Bear wasn't afraid of the cops, and Philipe listened to guided tours of an aquarium, who would have thought it would come to this? Two lonely, lonely men in the back of a serial killer's van, pathetically grateful that at least they won't have to face death alone. The music is Sigur Ros.

      Edgy, yet entertainingly dark and pertinent to today's Internet. One admires the meta subtlety of apparently unrestrained trollery, which is in fact, fully controlled. Bravo! <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Kudos and two thumbs-up for a well-done  <em>Nice Pete "Welcome, acid_police!"</em>  Quite apropos, given the strip. Bring the whole family. <br/> 
 And cheers to newcomer acid_police who performed the role of newbie quite expertly. Keep an eye out for more from this newcomer. <br/>

Finally, amidst the spittle and frenzy, I misread one juicy bon mot as  <em>assetbar fans so big and hardcore they require 220 volts</em> ...and really liked that.

      Old Mister Johnson had troubles of his own <br/> 
He had a yellow ratacatt which wouldn't leave its home; <br/> 
He tried and he tried to give the ratacatt away, <br/> 
He gave it to a man goin' far, far away. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back the very next day, <br/> 
The ratacatt came back, we thought he was a goner <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back; it just couldn't stay away. <br/> 
Away, away, yea, yea, yea <br/> 
 <br/> 
The man around the corner swore he'd kill the ratacatt on sight, <br/> 
He loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamite; <br/> 
He waited and he waited for the ratacatt to come around, <br/> 
Ninety seven pieces of the man is all they found. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back the very next day, <br/> 
The ratacatt came back, we thought he was a goner <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back; it just couldn't stay away. <br/> 
Away, away, yea, yea, yea <br/> 
 <br/> 
He gave it to a little boy with a dollar note, <br/> 
Told him for to take it up the river in a boat; <br/> 
They tied a rope around its neck, it must have weighed a pound <br/> 
Now they drag the river for a little boy that's drowned. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back the very next day, <br/> 
The ratacatt came back, we thought he was a goner <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back; it just couldn't stay away. <br/> 
Away, away, yea, yea, yea <br/> 
 <br/> 
He gave it to a man going up in a balloon, <br/> 
He told him for to take it to the man in the moon; <br/> 
The balloon came down about ninety miles away, <br/> 
Where he is now, well I dare not say. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back the very next day, <br/> 
The ratacatt came back, we thought he was a goner <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back; it just couldn't stay away. <br/> 
Away, away, yea, yea, yea <br/> 
 <br/> 
He gave it to a man going way out West, <br/> 
Told him for to take it to the one he loved the best; <br/> 
First the train hit the curve, then it jumped the rail, <br/> 
Not a soul was left behind to tell the gruesome tale. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back the very next day, <br/> 
The ratacatt came back, we thought he was a goner <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back; it just couldn't stay away. <br/> 
Away, away, yea, yea, yea <br/> 
 <br/> 
The ratacatt it had some company one night out in the yard, <br/> 
Someone threw a boot-jack, and they threw it mighty hard; <br/> 
It caught the ratacatt behind the ear, she thought it rather slight, <br/> 
When along came a brick-bat and knocked the ratacatt out of sight <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back the very next day, <br/> 
The ratacatt came back, we thought he was a goner <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back; it just couldn't stay away. <br/> 
Away, away, yea, yea, yea <br/> 
 <br/> 
Away across the ocean they did send the ratacatt at last, <br/> 
Vessel only out a day and making water fast; <br/> 
People all began to pray, the boat began to toss, <br/> 
A great big gust of wind came by and every soul was lost. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back the very next day, <br/> 
The ratacatt came back, we thought he was a goner <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back; it just couldn't stay away. <br/> 
Away, away, yea, yea, yea <br/> 
 <br/> 
On a telegraph wire, sparrows sitting in a bunch, <br/> 
The ratacatt was feeling hungry, thought she'd like 'em for a lunch; <br/> 
Climbing softly up the pole, and when she reached the top, <br/> 
Put her foot upon the electric wire, which tied her in a knot. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back the very next day, <br/> 
The ratacatt came back, we thought he was a goner <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back; it just couldn't stay away. <br/> 
Away, away, yea, yea, yea <br/> 
 <br/> 
The ratacatt was a possessor of a family of its own, <br/> 
With seven little kittens till there came a cyclone; <br/> 
Blew the houses all apart and tossed the ratacatt around, <br/> 
The air was full of kittens, and not a one was ever found. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back the very next day, <br/> 
The ratacatt came back, we thought he was a goner <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back; it just couldn't stay away. <br/> 
Away, away, yea, yea, yea <br/> 
 <br/> 
The atom bomb fell just the other day, <br/> 
The H-Bomb fell in the very same way; <br/> 
Russia went, England went, and then the U.S.A. <br/> 
The human race was finished without a chance to pray. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back the very next day, <br/> 
The ratacatt came back, we thought he was a goner <br/> 
But the ratacatt came back; it just couldn't stay away. <br/> 
Away, away, yea, yea, yea

      How's this for an avatar? I'll assume, since you are threatening me with a biological weapon people stopped being afraid of almost a decade ago, that you are stuck in an age when primal internet aggression was a means of survival in the hostile and uncharted message board frontier. It was necessary then. I understand this.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Most have moved on, and are better people for it. It is now certainly lame to be up in someone's shit like an Oscar Wilde rimjob on the internet. Take a piss, ratacatt. <br/>

      That's pretty good for an avatar I've got to admit.  Now how's this for an avatar reply?  Yes, that's my actual penis.  From multiple angles.  Some of you may have to mouse over until the old image expires from the cache.

      Damn, that is nutso dedication, but again, you're behind the curve. We live in an age where the internet has rendered people completely numb to the sight of penises. In fact, I think we visit the internet with the expectation that some taint is gonna jerk off in front of us. I'm frankly surprised this wasn't your first move.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Plus, it would've been much more aggressive if you had a sturdy hard-on thrusting toward the camera. The flaccidity of it is almost like a white flag. Vulnerable, delicate. But I'll still give you a chubby for exposing yourself to some random dude.

      wow this is so neat it's like I feel like we are bonding I don't usually have people talk to me on this thing I hope I'm not being too forward like when a girl smiles at me and then I assume it means she wants me to put my penis inside her does that ever happen to you where you totally take things the wrong way like that?  Anyway still as it is I really appreciate it and if you want to be friends on facebook or whatever we could hook up as long as you're pretty much what I'm looking for in a facebook friend which is like, not a whore, right, not like this other guy who was on here who offered to meet up with me and I looked him up and from his account it was basically plainly clear that he friends anyone and everyone and parties all the time with just random people who are probably all smoking pot and doing E don't get me wrong I don't have a problem with pot but when it becomes your social lubricant and all your social interactions revolve around the stuff then okay it's time to go to rehap right.  And also you should NOT HAVE A FUCKING MYSPACE ACCOUNT ONLY FUCKING FUCKNUT FUCKTARDS HAVE MYSPACE ACCOUNTS.  so yeah look me up send me an e-mail or something meow weird at symbol midconet dot net

      An Urban Dictionary search for "oscar wilde rimjob" yielded nothing. However there is an entry for "Oscarbedogasm" which I assumed meant an orgasm resulting in body fluids bursting out of every opening this being what happened to Oscar Wilde's body on his deathbed shortly after he passed. This was not what the definition was but at least this is presumably not something that happens, at least not unless you die right after you orgasm.

      Yeah, I knew this Chicago Jew named Kreitsler back in the day, he drove like he invented road rage. <br/> 
 One time he pulls up next to an old lady waiting on a red light. She's looking over at him, kinda nervous like. <br/> 
 He couldn't resist. As soon as the light changes, he floors it and cuts the wheel hard, plows right into her land yacht. This was in the 60's when boys were men, and everything factory was a muscle car. <br/>

      Nice-on-water, don't let the Secret Furry Contingent in the Achewood Fanbase get to you. It  <em>does not matter</em>  why Ray is friends with humans despite the early arcs, why Nice Pete has sideburns but is a cat, why Teodor can bleed but was introduced to us as a stuffed animal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To get all Quine and Kripke on this shit, "is a cat" and "is a stuffed animal" do not denote as they do in our world or in other contexts. I don't want to go into specifics, because  <em>that would feed the furries</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the risk of getting lamed, "Achewood"'s version of "is a cat" is basically "Garfield" minus the formula plus the "Far Side" comics about Hell plus the installments of "Peanuts" where Charlie Brown outright says "No one likes me." There is no room in that equation for continuity or loving care. I am still hoping Roast Beef's maudlin wedding poop ends up with Molly going back to the guy with the enormous wang whose rubbers horrified RB so. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Such questions about self-created "puzzlements" that the contents of the world clearly wants you to ignore, and a longing for their resolution, leads you down a path studded with Keenspot comics, non-nostalgic ownership of Thundercats DVD's, and Achewood  <em>fan fiction</em> . You will create your own character who visits the wedding and falls in love with Ray's hot sister who is good at everything!  <em>Do you want this future Nice-on-water</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Let us instead focus on how Nathan thought he was going to get to put his placement on those sideburns (to paraphrase Young Money) but now is going to die a slow, painful death -- while Nice Pete had the depth of the trackside grave calculated the money Nathan touched his gut.

      I call dogshit.  a long standing lover of Achewood... that's saying alot. but I have never liked Nice Pete. and believe wholeheartedly that Teodor would not be so foolhardy as to step into his van on this dogshit 'role play' of Nice Pete's. let me think about how Teodor totally snubbed Nice Pete to share some weed with Ray and shoot the stoned as fuck shit about how ridiculous Nice Pete's lyrics were.  <br/>

 <br/> 
I mean really I just hate Nice Pete as a character and am hating the current storyline. I choose to speak now. so be it. deal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
only a FUCKING IDIOT would ever engage in any activity with NICE PETE. and we all know that TEODOR is not a fucking idiot. someone doing some math here? no? I'll be leaving now. <br/>
