      properly maintained grow-rooms are lit with warm lights (both physically warm and warm to your ocular senses), and are very clean. Not to mention the rich green colored leaves and the small, diamondesque  crystals that look like dew glittering in the early morning and the heavenly aroma that overwhelms you the second you start to take a walk through god's natural medication.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roast Beef may not have a good reaction with weed, but he should get Ray to buy him a laptop and spend more time in the grow room.

      The smell of marijuana, both pre and post smoke, is not something I would refer to as "heavenly" <br/>

I am evidently one of a few people in this world for whom the word that best describes the smell of bud is "vomitous".

      I have tried to eat cookies while this unfortunately high. My teeth became atomic bombs of sensation, annihilating everything above the neck whenever they clicked together. Drymouth combined with extreme sensory overload to make me feel like I was swallowing boulders, if the boulders were made of rainbows. I'm pretty sure the feeling of digestion alone was so overpowering I couldn't see two feet in front of me. All this was at a party where pretty much no one else was stoned. It was not a very intelligent decision?

      Man I remember when I first started smoking, and what the munchies were like those first few times. All feeling the freshly chewed food slide slowly down your throat. All actually feeling your valves in your throat open and close, freaking out thinking it's going down the wrong tube and into my lungs. <br/>

Good times, good times.

      I always found mince pies worked well. <br/> 
After it started one christmas, I pretty much kept our local supermarket making mince pies for an entire year because my brother and I would be stoned every evening and head down around 9 to raid the kitchen cupboard for the mince pies. I'd get through a pack of 12 a day easy, and my brother usually eat most of the other pack... so our mother would hafta go and get more the next day.  <br/> <br/> <br/> Just to clarify, she didn't mind us toking on the weed. She smoked it too. She would actually reward us with it for good behaviour.  <br/> 
Sometimes I wonder if my becoming a dick after I moved to London was in any way connected to not being stoned any more... o_0; <br/>
