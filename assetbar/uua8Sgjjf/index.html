      Comfort is not a major issue for boys with their sagging jeans. <br/> 
 <br/> 
With their pants at normal sagging height, the belt will be right under their buttocks as they sit in the hard classroom chair.  I have asked if it was uncomfortable to sit on a big thick leather belt, and they reply that comfort is irrelevant to fashion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even more ridiculous to me than the comfort aspect is the  <em>gotta hold my pants up with my hand while I walk or they will fall down around my ankles</em>  issue.  I just laugh out loud when I see that.

      Haha yeah I've always wondered the same thing.  I've always thought that the weight of the belt would even be counterproductive to keeping the pants up.  Especially because the belt buckle is usually the size of a hubcap.

      The belt is a fashion accessory.  A  <strong>requirement</strong> .  Of course it makes no sense. <br/>

The Kinks recorded a song called  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145104/https://www.codehot.co.uk/lyrics/ijkl/kinks/dedicated.htm"><em>Dedicated Follower of Fashion</em>.  I think Ray Davies wrote it.</a>   It addresses the mindset of someone whose life is made or broken by his pursuit of the latest fashions. <br/> 
 <br/> 
These kids are doing this to make sense.  They are doing it to conform. <br/>

      Unfortunately, this has been around since I was in high school. The all-boys Catholic school I attended required your shirt to be tucked in at all times, which just isn't feasible with perpetually falling pants. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We had only one lady teacher, who spent her days in a state of perpetual annoyance. This was because whenever she'd see one of our many saggers roaming campus, she'd tell the fellow to get things tucked back in. The offender would do this by simply unbuckling his pants, letting them hit the floor, then pulling them back up so that they at least partially covered his shirt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Our poor affronted teacher would then usually yell "you do NOT do that in front of a lady," for all the good it did her. Eventually she wised up, and sagging in her presence became a detentionable offense.

      Something about the mad-rutty crown gets me every time I see it... I think it might be part of the way Ray reveals himself to be a "cat" -- he feels the need to in some way demonstrate that he's made a conquest.  However, just walking around and strutting with his tail up in the air is not hell of classy -- hence the ruttin' crown.

I once met the man at a convention.  I mostly stayed quiet and listened to him talk.  He's the most fascinating speaker I've ever heard.  My friend Amy stuck around him pretty much through the whole con, climaxing at a kaffeeklatsch where Pratchett said to her, "You know, I've seen you follow me this entire time, and all I know you as is 'the girl with the cat-ear hat.'" <br/>

      You know?  I'm reasonably certain this is the very first time I've seen a repeat strip since I've known Achewood.  My "first" Achewood was when I started at no. 1 and ended with the latest, which at the time was [https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua6SKWmN]Keith Moon's Alive Head[/url].  I went to click "next" and felt disappointed when I saw I was on the main page.  Then I realized it was evening at the time, so there would be a new one pretty soon.  I don't think he's done a "greatest hits" since well before the past two arcs.  That's at least two years.  That's cool.

      They are most likely candied fruits. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The thing about fruitcake is, if you slice it off about an inch thick, put butter on it, and toast it in a toaster oven so the butter melts all through it, it tastes much much better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Preparing it like that won't necessarily make it taste good to you, but it will make it taste  <em>better</em> .   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And when prepared like that, I can enjoy a slice every ten years or so.

      The major problem with fruitcake is that most people who have tried it have tried the abomination that they sell in little tins at the grocery store, or some great aunt's flubbed recipe (likely involving those godawful glow-in-the-dark 'fruits' pictured above).  <br/> <br/> REAL fruitcake, done properly, is sweet, moist, delicious, and gets all your unsuspecting relatives falling down drunk.

      Christmas is a time for re-runs. Actually in the true spirit of Christmas, re-reruns of reruns. The same shithouse black and white saccharine piece of crap from the 50's. It's not as if Onstad wouldn't be aware of the irony. Damn, I mean if the idiots on this assetbar can pick it up... [wait! i'm an idiot on this assetbar].

I think Acheworld works much better as a community with a new comic every day; a lot of the time it seems that conversations have trouble continuing too long because people don't want to invest the energy in reading more than a day's worth of posts.

      Being from the autocorrect generation, it's proven to be a very hard habit to break myself of. (In the back of my mind, I think that if we capitalize "I" we should capitalize "You" and "Him" and "Her." It's a language rule that has never made sense to me. But I guess one shouldn't question the teachings.)

      i don't know, i'm kind of looking forward to onstad's week of reissues just to see what he thinks are some of his best strips.  lazy? maybe.  but i think onstad's done enough for you and me in the past six  years that we can afford to give him a break every once in awhile. <br/> 
 <br/> 
not that onstad needs defending.  i'm sure he doesn't give two shits that some anonymous internet dude thinks he's lazy.

      also - does the fact that this is a re-reissue really matter?  people seem to be making a big deal of that, but when it comes down to it is posting a comic that's been posted twice already any lazier than posting one that's been posted once?  he posted it because (in his estimation) it's one of his bests, not because it had been posted twice already.
