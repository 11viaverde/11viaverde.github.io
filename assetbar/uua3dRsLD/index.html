      OGN (original grammar Nazi). <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's interesting that the few obvious errors in spelling and diction seen in Achewood are usually from Ray (assuming here that Ray wrote the lectern notes). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe it's part of Onstad's characterisation of Ray, like Beef's lack of punctuation. Or it could be that channeling Ray causes Chris to temporarily drop a few dozen IQ points, allowing errors to seep in.

      I was sure that the misspelling was Ray's--clearly he wrote the prompter notes, and Onstad is a better proofreader than that. But it turns out it's not a misspelling at all (sorry I can't BBcode for shit): <br/>

      I think it's still a misspelling.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dictionaries and lexographers have a responsibility to record language as it is used, not as it 'should' be used. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's why the online dictionary you linked to also has an entry for 'irregardless': https://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irregardless <br/> 
 <br/> 
People use it, so it must be recorded. Still a mistake though.

      That makes sense.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So it's not a word, but you really think it's a mistake? That's the sort of misspelling Ray would make; it's way out of character for Onstad. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And just for curiosity's sake, anyone know of a blatant (not-in-character) typo anywhere in the archive?

      I shall never accept that "grey" can be spelled with an 'a'. It is simply unnatural. <br/>

      On the discussion of dangerous creatures, I think the cassowary isn't given the cred it deserves. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When ANZAC soldiers were fighting the Japanese in New Guinea, they were told to keep watch for cassowaries - they hide in the forest.  They will see you before you see them.  And they will flank you, fucking  <em>Jurassic Park</em>  raptor Muldoon-style.  Jumping up to seven feet, claws far too long and deadly for any good logic. <br/>

      Maybe because...it's all  <em>lies</em> : <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cassowaries have a reputation for being dangerous to people and domestic animals. The 2007 edition of the Guinness World Records lists the cassowary as the world's most dangerous bird. During World War II American and Australian troops stationed in New Guinea were warned to steer clear of them. Many internet entries about cassowaries state that they can disembowel a man or dog with one kick, with the long second toe claw cutting the gut open. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In his book "Living Birds of the World" from 1958, Ornithologist Thomas E. Gilliard wrote; <br/> 
 <br/> 
    "The inner or second of the three toes is fitted with a long, straight, murderous nail which can sever an arm or eviscerate an abdomen with ease. There are many records of natives being killed by this bird."[14] <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, Gilliard did not include any such records or any references for them, and although this assessment of the danger posed by cassowaries has been repeated in print by authors including Gregory S. Paul (1988)[15] and Jared Diamond (1997)[16], recent research on hundreds of cassowary attacks has only been able to find one human death. A 2003 study of attacks by the Southern Cassowary in Queensland found no wounds larger than punctures about 1.5 centimeters in diameter.[17] Of 221 attacks studied, 150 were against humans. 75% of these were from cassowaries that had been fed by people. 71% of the time the bird chased or charged the victim. 15% of the time they kicked. Of the attacks, 73% involved the birds expecting or snatching food, 5% involved defending natural food sources, 15% involved defending themselves from attack, 7% involved defending their chicks or eggs. Of all 150 attacks there was only one human death.[18]

      So what's it gonna take for you to think that cassowaries are more dangerous than other birds?  'Cause that's the comparison population here; no one said they're more dangerous than lions or hippos.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
You think 1.5 centimeters in diameter is a smallish wound?  Have you ever heard of even one human death from a hummingbird attack?  I've heard of people getting killed when someone dropped a frozen turkey off a highway overpass, but I'm not gonna give the turkey credit for the kill there.

      It is actually a Hermit crab, but it becomes so large and completely terrestrial that its carapace hardens enough that it does not require a shell. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also fun, hermit crabs are actually more closely related to shrimp than true crabs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are shrimp walking around, people.

      Depends.  There is a bright line between lesbian and, as you say, pseudo-lesbian.  The latter features gay-for-pay actresses with impeccable makeup, impractically long nails, and that silly tip-of-tongue technique.  The former probably contains more kink than you were bargaining for and decent odds that at least one of the performers will be someone you knew from college. <br/>

      What?!? Men don't READ. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, more seriously, men seem to prefer videos and photographs. I know a great many men who watch and look at porn, but far more women who read or write erotica. I have never met a man who liked erotica, or actually preferred it to video. The authors of erotica (of any sort--gay, lesbian, straight) are predominantly female--as are their readership.

      OK.  Now that we've broached the topic.  There are too many women that think we (men) are brainless automatons that exist only to stick our dicks somewhere.  Well, while that's  <em>mostly</em>  correct, it is well-stated that the principal sexual organ is the  <em>brain</em> .   <br/>

We will respond better to sexy thoughts than to skin.  A great lover is one that has you 75% there before you even hold hands. <br/>

      But those same thoughts don't always require a ton of work or plenty of time to simmer. Simply arriving with purpose in a skirt, waxed, bereft of undergarments and leading the way in the direction of the nearest supply closet or Flemish alcove is more than enough to provide the necessary starter in the average person. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What so many people often forget is that this goes both ways. Leave some things up to the imagination occasionally rather than trying to concoct some elaborate or belabored scenario. Set up the basics and the audience will fill the rest far better than you could ever attempt to do.

      Sorry if you found the first line in my post offensive. It was a joke, nothing more. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't say that there are NO men who read or write the stuff--just that most of the readers and authors seem to be female, based on bringing up the subject with many boyfriends and friends (both male and female), reading the biographies or profile pages of authors, reading comments on stories online. The guys I do know who read erotica do it rarely compared to how often they watch porn. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Conversely, I've met only one other girl (in addition to myself) who watches porn. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Most porn is really terrible, and most straight and lesbian porn seems to be geared towards men (the focus being almost entirely upon the girl in the former, and the most awkward, unrealistic sex imaginable in the latter).

      Erotica is potentially far superior to video. While reading you have far greater control over the pacing than video which means it's a far more satisfying experience generally. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For me some of the most important parts of a lady are things that video can't even begin to evoke. Something like the feel of her skin and her scent. Other things it can only express in a rather limited way, like her smile (porn stars are only acting most of the time after all). The written word however draws on your own experiences though and can, if well written, make for a far sexier time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course nothing tops watching porn with your woman (or man (or both) ).

      I've not seen any porno where the actors can actually act for shit. In theory it could be good but I've yet to see anything that really convinced me it's more than just bodies banging together on the other side of a screen. <br/> <br/> <br/> Ok, I tell a lie, I actually love it when sometimes when the actress gives a sly glance and mischievous grin to the camera mid bang.

      Evan Stone is usually fairly decent when it comes to actual acting. Of course, he knows his limits and is mainly just capable of being vaguely funny. Still, he was the absolute best part of  <em>Pirates</em> , including the sex and the horrible, terrifying Jesse Jane.

      Cartilage Head did not buy that stock ticker. He stole it from the iron pagoda in which his mother lives. She was lying under a cloud of "morphine shivers", cradling a daguerreotype of her dead husband. She was wrapped in sheets of black silk and Spanish lace. The music was theremin. The sky was the colour of blood.

      Ordinarily, yes, but this is Cartilage Head.  His music is more than just an auditory experience.  The screeching of the bow on the saw combines with the visual performance, the way his legs curve with the instrument and tears drip down his contorted face in a synesthetic ballet of sorrow.

      Emboldened by the anonymity of a sunglasses'd pachyderm, the typically mordant cat embraces his impending doom in the reckless fashion of a death-row inmate forgoing his final meal for one last spirited game of Edward 40-hands, where the 'malt liquor' is an ale of fermented mattress-stuffing and saliva brewed in the cell's toilet. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He has no bottles, of course, so the 'game' consists primarily of the ritualistic scooping of the toilet brew into the man's left shoe.  Eyes jammed shut, he pours from the left shoe to the right, and remembers drinking mint juleps with Delilah, and her flaxen hair.

      While awesome in its way, I do not care for the appearance of Cartilage Head. He was a one-time character inseparable from his arc. That he should appear in another situation seems... tacky. <br/>

Just because something is good does not mean it should become recurring. Sometimes the best you can do is make your entrance, give you few lines, and leave them wanting more forever.

"aight" so i load an' 8 pack of 20 oz orange gatorade and a 6 pack fo 12 oz gatorade (orange flav. 2 diff sizes for thirst scalability. more on this later) but dat was to hannle my drink needs cuz im very active an only gatorade provides teh enrgy i need 2 stay strong an' not waste muh workout. anyways, what i tries to say is i still needed some snax cuz i do enjoy them so, but at teh same time was get a reg. grocery run for ma gramma, lik bread, detergent, shit lik dat all stacked otnop of teh 4 cases of bottle water in teh bed (i mention dis b4 plz try 2 paytention) but wat i realized woz, as we trav through teh cookie/chips isle of teh store she picked ot her fav chipz which i dun eat cuz i dun like teh taste an' she was like  <br/> 
"pick ur chipz and cookies and wat not wateer u wan' den we go ove' an' get cat food,etc" <br/> 
an i said  <br/> 
"aight" but den my eyes fell epon teh cart, nearly full aweddy with still some vital cat food to put an' if i waz 2 get ma cookies there'd b no room so i was all in my head "ya know wat? ima skip teh snax dis time" an' i did an' we couldn't fit erything as it was an' i jus' kept thinkin' we couldn't get all we wanted cuz she needed to fill the bottom of teh cart wit 4 cases of stuff you can get for free from teh tap**. damn, wat a whirl we live in. <br/> 
 <br/> 
**i know u pay 4 water bill an isn't exactly free. i know this.

      It varies by area.  LI water comes from an aquifer fed by glacial water.  This source is beyond reproach.  The delivery system (pipes) may taint it or you are drawing from a small well that was not drilled deep enough. <br/>

Same with NYC water -- its the pipes that taint it (also the bodies found in the central park reservoir).

      yeah well technically Indians might be asian but obviously they are different from Japanese/Korean/Vietnamese/etc.  The latter are all more similar to each other than Indians are to them.  I dunno, I suppose there's a variety of Indian genres too, right.  I mean. Mercury was Indian, and he didn't look too Indian.  But anyway, I'll say this.  Indian has one of the most fucked up cultures anywhere.  The only way it could seem less fucked up is if Indian had tons of money.  Then it would be the U.S.

      The old classification was that those of the Indian subcontinent were Caucasoid and those Japanese/Korean etc were Mongoloid.  Of course the latter is now an insult, but I think today when we said "Asian," we mean that Far Eastern race, and not usually Indian/ Pakistani etc., which I hear they call Asian in the UK.  Middle Eastern, Persian, Indian, etc are all still classified as Caucasian, I'm pretty sure.  I don't think this helps the discussion any though.

Wouldn't it be interesting if everyone on Assetbar knew what the other users' races were?  I think it would change certain things, even assuming 99% of us aren't racist.  It would just change the tone of certain conversations I bet.  Neat!

It's not actually that surprising to find Caucasoids so far east, seeing as how skulls dating back thousands of years, with Caucasoid features, have been found on the US East Coast. <br/>

 Red-haired mummified remains of Caucasoids have also been found in a desert in China.

      I was just perhaps obliquely referencing this idea that occurred to me that Indian culture is pretty ridiculous and prejudiced and ignorant in a lot of respects, no more so or less so than the U.S.  I just notice it more in Indian culture because when you're around a particular incarnation of something, you stop noticing it as much, kinda how you can get used to a bad smell. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Wozzeck's indicates that he's caught up hook line and sinker in the ignorant extremist ignorant (did I mention ignorant) rhetoric of local U.S. politics.  Don't get me wrong, NPR (and California too, for that matter,) is pretty shitty in some respects, but probably not in any of the ways in which wozzeck thinks it is.

      I'm sure that I am.  Nevertheless, my thinking in particular (and left-leaning thinking in general) does tend to be more rooted in objectivity and scientific reasoning than that mindset which is generally leaning towards the 'right' end of the political spectrum.  Sure there is leftist dogma just as there is rightist dogma.  The folks on the right just have more dogma, that's it.  I mean for fucks sake, Palin... Palin....  Have you been paying attention?  She has the education level of an 8th grader, a D minus 8th grader.  This is what a core block of right-leaning individuals chose as a representative.  I'm not saying your political views coincide with the right-leaning end of the spectrum, I'm just extrapolating that your thinking may be at least somewhat rooted in dogma because your above comment condemning CA and NPR was an example of classic rightist dogma.  I'm sorry, but if you're prejudiced against CA or NPR, it's very very difficult to conclude anything other than that your thinking is right of center.  In my mind, right of center means your thinking is steeped in dogma.  Stupid unthinking dogma.  The world is a complex place, and dogma is simple.  When the model with which you understand a system does not allow for as much variety as exists in the system, you're in trouble because your model will not give you an accurate understanding of the system.

      Try it and see. It depends on your water's existing mineral content mostly, I would think, and also water temperature.   <br/> 
  My water is very clean of minerals, as I have a whole house filter, so it will dissolve even in cold water. Also, you can mix to your own specs. <br/>

      I disagree, Mr. Bundgeetle.  Achewood hasn't been all that wacky in recent memory.  It's been a little flat.  If it has been wacky, it's been a different style of wacky than it was originally.  If by 'wacky,' you mean that it's been flat lately, then yes, it has been, but if that's what you mean, then 'wacky' is not an appropriate adjective.  It's been at times 'wacky' in a flat way recently.  It's definitely evolved.  For better or for worse, it's evolved.  It will never be what it was originally, but if you want constant unchanging stability, then you want Cathy, or Blondie, or Archie, or Dilbert.  Don't get me wrong, these examples all have had their moments, especially in the context of their intended audiences, such as these audiences are.  But, perhaps like their core audiences, these examples (Cathy, Family Circus, Marmaduke, etc) have been, for the most part, pedantic and repetitive and have never really even attempted to push any kind of artistic or expressive envelope, or if they did attempt to do so, then arguably their authors just didn't have much imagination or experience or even artistic literacy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Can we look back at Achewood and find a 'golden age' when seemingly every single strip made our hearts leap with joy?  Sure!  Can we trace that era of the strip to some innocence arisen from Onstad's being a novice at the whole gig?  Quite possibly.  Then again, if we examine you, personally, or any one of us, we can probably trace back our development to a time when we were a whole lot more cute, and a whole lot more interesting and creative.  That's how people develop.  It's not how cartoons normally develop, but Achewood is not a normal cartoon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The only strips that compare to Achewood that I personally know of (which may not be saying much) are Peanuts and Calvin & Hobbes.  These strips also captured a certain innocence and did so brilliantly, although, they were daily strips, so inevitably, there was a lot of what I would call neutral fluff mixed in.  These strips were different, however.  These strips took a different approach.  They had to - they were dailies.  Achewood is different.  Achewood explores stuff differently, and explores more stuff.  Achewood is a far more expansive survey of the Cartoonist's imagination, not in a better way, just in a different way.  If Peanuts and Calvin & Hobbes were the best that traditional cartooning had to offer, then Achewood is a nouveau cartooning.  Achewood is Gonzo cartooning in every sense of the word.  Achewood redefines the boundaries between the Cartoonist and his work, and indeed, between the audience and the work. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Without even intending to be, Achewood is not overtly political, indeed is far from being apolitical, and I'm not talking about the fact that the cats smoke weed.  Weed smoking is a cliche anymore and is only superficially taboo.  Weed is a large industry in the U.S. that is looked down upon by what passes for polite society (those who hold the political and social power) not unlike alcohol was once considered 'dirty.'  Smoking weed doesn't make a thing controversial anymore, it merely disenfranchises you, sort of like if you  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415013917/https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-briefs23-2009jul23,0,5452282.story">marry a porn star.</a>   You might lose your job, you might even go to jail, but you can still hold your head up high and say you didn't do anything wrong, and a huge percentage of society will agree with you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Achewood features all that is deeply taboo for us on a societal and personal level.  Achewood is just a character exploration of regular guys being their regular selves, and somehow, that is taboo these days.  It just isn't done.  How is this political?  Well, when you look at other popular web cartoons, when you look at virtually all popular television, and maybe even when you look in the mirror, you see a strict and formulaic adherence to a god-damned script.  What passes for controversy anymore is actually scripted, and not even elaborately so.  Remember back in the 80's when TV sitcoms would feature crude stereotypes of racial minorities and crude stereotypes of non-middle class lifestyles?  Remember Tony Danza and Garry Coleman and that very special episode of Family Ties when a black family moves into the house across the street and the neighborhood tries to run them out of town?  Puuuleeze.  How simplistic can you get.  But that's TV.  Always has been and always will be.  And so there has always been this void in centrally controlled mass media and this void was filled by people who were slightly creative, like Michael Jackson, whose various moments of genius could be bottled up, copied, and sold enmasse.  And this void was filled by rappers... remember the scary, very scary, 2 live crew? <br/> 
 <br/> 
2 live crew was controversial once upon a time, but now they look like a bunch of girl scouts.  American mass media is nothing but a big system which distributes cliche and stereotype.  It wasn't 2 live crew it's self which scared America so much, it was the idea of 2 live crew, and the ideas that these guys, these black guys, evoked.  2 live crew were mere icons.  You click on the icon, and it makes a scary sound, maybe makes a shiver run down your spine.  Well, as more and more icons became played out, the industry just kept generating more and more crap.  Now you've got fucking lesbians on prime time TV (and yes, they even fuck sometimes, just not in front of the cameras... not yet, anyway...) and it's still not enough for us.  Don't get me wrong, I've nothing against lesbians fucking on TV as long as it fits in the script, as long as it serves some purpose to tell a story, but not for the sake of simply having fucking lesbians for the sake of simply being 'edgy.'   <br/> 
 <br/> 
TV, mass media in general, is just a jumble of abstract stereotypes.  Is there any  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415013917/https://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">character development</a>  anymore?  Do you ever get to  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415013917/https://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/12/kayne-west-is-mad-as-hell-at-twitter-and-hes-not-going-to-take-this-anymore/">connect</a>  with a character anymore?  What greater threat is there to this mass media empire than the prospect of individuals with an imagination and an IQ above 80 and brain waves that haven't been lulled into a holding pattern by using TV as a drug?  What greater threat is there to the powers that be in our social and political systems than people who might be real?  This is how Achewood is political.  Achewood is as real as any cartoon has ever been or ever will be.  Achewood is Gonzo cartooning.  Roast Beef 'n Ray are all like "don't buy our fucking action figures bitch  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415013917/https://www.youtube.com/results?feature=moby&amp;search_query=Thy%20Unveiling&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f">we don't give a fuck!</a> " <br/>

      You have to remember that Schulz basically invented most of the things that are worthwhile in newspaper comics. Way more than you think. All the shit that's good about Calvin and Hobbes? Yeah, most of that came from Peanuts. It doesn't seem like such hot stuff anymore because of all the comics since has copied everything good about it, making those ideas seem bland and uninspired. That happens to a lot fo great works, there's probably a name for it. I don't know if Peanuts was ever hugely funny, but it was humourous and it was intelligent and it was incisive, and it was the best god damn thing that ever happened to the funny pages.

      I'd say Calvin and Hobbes owes even more to Little Nemo which is still legitimately awesome, unlike the bland and dull Peanuts.  <br/>

I'm told it was once great, but I have never had any desire to find out. I'd rather spend a few hours poring over a robot's ass.

      There might be something behind Watterson's reverence for Peanuts though.  The simple graphic presentation, with stories told from a child's perspective, seems to be an antecedent of C&H. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Wattersons' reverence is ironic relative to his anti-commercial stance (and Shulz's invention thereof).

      If y'all ever get the chance, "Schulz and Peanuts" is a pretty cool biography, one which finally made Peanuts interesting to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even if you don't read the long-ass book, take this away from my post: The dude put himself in his comics. Comics about camp represent his time in the military. There WAS a little red-haired girl. Things like that. He poured his heart and soul into Peanuts, then gave it a fresh coat of pleasantries to endear the public. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's the big thing that changed MY mind, anyway. You  <em>think</em>  it's just some dude with a poor imagination ("...and I'll add a dog, 'cause people like dogs!"), but he really wrote a poignant, long-form autobiography. And once you see the connection, you see how human the world of Peanuts really is... and THAT'S what made it so big in the first place.

      Firstly: try Peanuts again.  Here are some things, off the top of my head, that I love about Peanuts: old ones do a lot of strips with very little dialog that still work, the whole thing is permeated with this kind of stoic, sad worldview, old Snoopy had some of the best simply drawn but effective facial expressions of any comic ever, the strip tackled moral issues without ever really being moral or moralistic, and it had musical notation a lot of times for which I am a sucker. <br/>

      yeah I'll agree that Peanuts is not going to be funny to a lot of people up front, in fact it can be damned annoying.  But if you read one strip a day for a while, it starts to grow on you.  If you did read it and never got it, then maybe there's just something wrong with your brain, a tumor or something.  You should get that looked at.  I think maybe people go into Peanuts not realizing just how subtle it really is as a strip.  You kinda have to do a mental reset.  The strip operated in somewhat tight boundaries of form and content.  Once you 'get' that Shultz is operating from within these boundaries, you then start to perceive just how clever and subtle and nuanced it is, and sardonic too.  I never really got much out of Peanuts reading it in the paper as a kid or teenager.  It wasn't until later when I started reading it online that it clicked for me.  Even watching the animated specials, you can kinda take it all for granted even while liking it at the same time.

      johnmatrix, there are a lot of constructive replies to your comment here, and that's cool. But I'm gonna just kinda round it out here with the asshole's perspective: <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you have to ask what made Peanuts great, you'll never know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have a feeling that in ten years kids will be questioning the relevance of The Simpsons and The Far Side, too, and I will dismiss them in the same manner.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, you at least realize that there would be no Achewood had Charles Schulz not blazed that trail first, right? Tell me you understand that comics as we know them would be unrecognizable and considerably lamer without the prior existence of Peanuts and I won't make you go to bed without your supper.

      I don't know exactly what comics were like before Peanuts, and that's not really relevant to me. The question isn't whether it did influence comics, the question was why it's so highly regarded.

      First, I don't think anyone said anything about what comics were like before Peanuts.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Second, the question  <em>is</em>  "whether it did influence comics," as that is  <em>exactly</em>  why it is so highly regarded. If you like any comic strip that came after Peanuts, you have no intelligent choice but to at least tip your hat to Schulz.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm sorry to be stern. It's for your own good.

      I was kinda hoping Cartilage Head would be a one-off. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Partly because of the sitcom "hey we're out of jokes, let's resurrect a one-off guest star for Pavlovian approval" thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Partly because I thought his one previous appearance was a great complete thing in and of itself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Partly because of the way Ramses got less interesting the more often he appeared. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Partly because he creeps me the fuck out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Partly because (specific to this incidence) Beef's rant is gold, and Cartilage Head's sudden reappearance takes the focus off that. <br/>

      Honestly this kind of sentiment to me is bullshit.  "The character was SOO GOOD we can't have him SPOILED by him having his face shown again, goddamn it, because it's totally out of the artist's hands if this mysterious character is demystified."  There's nothing cheap about bringing something popular back.  That's how Ray and Beef went from two of the dirtiest dudes in town to the main characters.  This isn't a Happening, where the spontaneity and uniqueness of each performance is totally dependent on you, the privileged elite patron, being there serendipitously.  It's a webcomic based on characters and arcs.  I'd actually like to see what Onstad can do with CH one more time.  Ten times is overstaying his welcome.  Twice is not.  You won't know how this turns out till it's over, so just sit tight and enjoy it. <br/>

      At the same time Onstad seems, as of late, to have misused and overused Mexican Magical Realism as well. And it only took one recurrence of the garage sale -- even if it did have some new and interesting observations -- to feel a bit old. <br/>

      Ok first of all you are either deliberately misreading me to make your point, or you are dense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray and Beef went from two cartoon cats with basically no distinguishing features, to characters. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ramses was introduced as a rumour who was cool because he was a legendary hard man who gave nothing away. He is now demystified, but the mystery has not been replaced with anything interesting. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cartilage Head was introduced in a story that was perfect and complete, while keeping the character at arm's length to maintain the creepy mystery. Now, already, he is a recurring character. He is going the way of Freddy Kruger, who quickly shifted from terrifying oeneric child molestor to someone whose face was printed on kiddie pyjamas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It isn't true of all characters. For example I would be happy to see more of Nightlife, but I don't think anything would be gained by bringing back Lonis Edison. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But you're obviously a fan of over-exposure. Enjoy your skin cancer.

      "You disagree with me.  You're dumb and also deliberately misinterpreted what I said."  That's the way to do it.  Sorry, but outright rejecting something as false and providing your own point of view is not the same thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray started just as legendary and mythical as Ramses.  Remember T having dreams about him wearing a cape?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Is the character of Cartilage Head irrevocably destroyed for you now?  If so you might be the dense one. <br/>

      When Ramses is first even mentioned, it is in the context of him being a force of nature, a gentleman, and the winner of the Great Outdoor Fight. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When Ray first appears, it is as "the cigarette-smoking cat on the far right who is shocked at how dirty Teodor is talking." <br/>

Not exactly the same legendary level of mythical. <br/>

      if you has panic attack maybe you have imbalance of brain activities I suggest you see a psychiatrist or if you can't afford one then you can at least afford the book "healing anxiety and depression" by daniel amen it's a good book with a modern approach to psychiatry which is unfortunately not very common in psychiatry today psychiatry is in the dark ages they is mostly practically only one step removed from bleeding you with leeches.

      mmm.  speaking of hair, it's like, what is up with hair... some people have hairy chests and some don't.  And there are different varieties of hair too.. some hair is thicker than others.  Some is thin.  It makes me wonder I mean, are there people out there with like, horse hair?  Or close to it?  What's that like, however rough or thin your hair is, to be on one end or the other of the evolutionary spectrum for your genius?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
that makes me wonder also about assholes too.  I mean, not just assholes, but among other things, assholes are a pretty pointed example of this... It's like... perhaps some people's assholes are evolutionarily more comfortable with others?  Ya know.  Asshole comfort is a big industry.  they sell powders and gels for it.  Ya ever wake up and you are wearing some tight jeans or something and you are sweating profusely and your asshole is all sticky and it's like, damn, I need a shower.  my asshole needs a shower.  What if you were like that all day on a normal day?  Ya know.  Maybe in the literature there is some disease where your asshole won't stop sweating. <br/> 
 <br/> 
there was something else I was going to mention too, but I can't remember what it is just now.

      Hair distribution on humans started out as an example of neotony, but picked up a load of sexual connotations. Our adoption of clothing and spreading to all kinds of climates stopped dead any evolutionary trend with reagards to body hair and probably accounts for the large variety between people. Hair itself is pretty impresive in terms of evolution, slightly surpassed by the feather (in my humble opinion). <br/>

      A vulture was hacking at my feet. It had already torn my boots and stockings to shreds, now it was hacking at the feet themselves. Again and again it struck at them, then circled several times restlessly round me, then returned to continue its work. A gentleman passed by, looked on for a while, then asked me why I suffered the vulture. "I'm helpless," I said. "When it came and began to attack me, I of course tried to drive it away, even to strangle it, but these animals are very strong, it was about to spring at my face, but I preferred to sacrifice my feet. Now they are almost torn to bits." "Fancy letting yourself be tortured like this!" said the gentleman. "One shot and that's the end of the vulture." "Really ?" I said. "And would you do that?" "With pleasure," said the gentleman, "I've only got to go home and get my gun. Could you wait another half hour?" "I'm not sure about that," said I, and stood for a moment rigid with pain. Then I said: "Do try it in any case, please." "Very well," said the gentleman, "I'll be as quick as I can." During this conversation the vulture had been calmly listening, letting its eye rove between me and the gentleman. Now I realized that it had understood everything; it took wing, leaned far back to gain impetus, and then, like a javelin thrower, thrust its beak through my mouth, deep into me. Falling back, I was relieved to feel him drowning irretrievably in my blood, which was filling every depth, flooding every shore.

      survey here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
  does anyone have any faith in humanity?  If so how much?  What percentage of your fellow humans are kidna, piece of shit that you'd rather not share a continent with?  Do you peg that number at 1%?  10%? 50%? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm thinking that if all of the systems of society kinda imploded, some countries would be better off than others. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You look at some countries where they don't have a lot of systems in place to keep everyone in line, and some of those countries are totally fucked, whereas others of those countries are relatively peaceful. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think if government sorta collapsed, the U.S. would be nothing but murder and mayhem, whereas some other countries might be better off... Canadians are a lot nicer than Americans, so if the government sorta collapsed in Canada, you'd be a lot better off in Canada than in the U.S., except of course for all the asshole Americans who would come to Canada if there weren't a boarder patrol to keep them out. <br/>

      Looking at it on a country scale is a bit difficult, but I fully understand it on a smaller level. Imagine a village of a few hundred people, everyone there knows everyone else, it's a bit out of the way, so the main past time is talking to your neighbours. Society in general collapses, but for the village they'd just keep going as they always did. They aren't going to riot and go rob the nearest shop because they know the shop owner and can get credit there whenever they like. Now compare that to where I live, I don't even know my neighbour's first names, society implodes and I have no idea what those motherfuckers would do.

      Out of curiosity, why does 'Stad put "Continues" on some of the mid-arc strips but not all? Maybe if it looked like an ending, but this one doesn't look any more like an end then any of the other ones in this arc. I thought the first comic in the arc was gonna be a one-shot, but after that it looked like a full-on thing pretty much every time.

      Another reason is that if he does a strip that he intends to be the start of an arc , but stands alone by itself and then finds the rest of his ideas foir the arc to be unsatisfactory he can just can the arc. If he tried doing that here a LOT of people would be upset, so it's fairly safe to put a 'to be continued' in.
