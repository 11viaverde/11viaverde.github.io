      ... a pissed-off, feral teddy bear who spent enough time in prison to discern the finer points of German vs. French cell-mates.  Cornelius has done violent things before, he will do them again with sufficient provocation.  Somehow, being shot by Pat was not enough to draw his ire, but now we know what is.

      This is a level of fallibility we have never before beheld in Cornelius over the last week or so. First his violent solution to the Phileppe's e-buggering, and now this tragic turn of events. We can only hope and pray he will recover soon.

      I don't know that rage and mortification of the flesh count as fallibility in this situation.  Like everyone in Achewood, Cornelius has his own slant on reality, and we get peeks at it here and there.  I thought he was perfectly rational to take a cricket bat to the computer: cut off the threat at the source.  He seemed philosophical about being injured by Pat.  Who would know better what to expect when the uninitiated drink grappa with guns in their hands?  But this tattoo is an insult to his dignity, and a self-inflicted one, at that.  And there could be more to the story that we don't know yet, that makes the tattoo extra-heinous for him.

      Actually, looking at it again, the badassery seems to grow every time I view it. <br/>

At first I was disgusted and horrified to see the normally calm and collected Cornelius doing this, but now he actually seems like a grizzly bear just being angry.

      ... Why this Pro-Cornelius attitude? <br/> 
The "badass games" were a farce... meant only to highlight that Cornelius is old, doesn't know what bread is, and gets on well with  <em>trained</em>  dogs. There was nothing remotely badass about it.  <br/> 
That aside, we've witnessed him basically being a douche to Philippe without even the excuse of humour, culminating in destroying a monitor out of spite.  <br/> 
AND it turns out he doesn't like Star Wars. <br/>

Well, I'd say the crusty old git is getting his comeuppance.  <br/>

      I guess my dream came true, but really I only wanted to be an extra. <br/> 
 <br/> 
fineoakstructure:  Your reading of my metaphor is poor.  They are not dogs, I am not royalty.  They are the snot-dropping courtier; the Queen is Acheworld (the community of readers, not the comic strip or Onstad); the people who give them lames are the corgis peeing on their legs.  I am another courtier, but I pluck my nose-hairs most of the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
sortelli:  You can like trolls if you want.  Those other trolls keep asking why they get lamed; I was answering.  Okay, my bad.  Trolls just want to stir up trouble by definition.  As for the rest of it, I referred to an older comment as evidence for my argument, and I wrote "in Achewood style" as an example of what I was trying to explain to those other trolls.  "Show, don't tell" is generally considered good writing style and good pedagogy, but as you well know, I only wrote that way because I'm a dick. <br/> 
 <br/> 
wittyname:  I guess you're agreeing with sortelli?  If you hadn't lamed my comment, it would be impossible to tell what side you're on.  Nice job.

      lateadopter: no, your metaphor was asinine and pompous, and your reading of my comment was poor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I did not say you called them "dogs," I said "lower than dogs,"  kind of like a snot-dropping courtier might be considered; it was not a reference to your corgi comment.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's obvious the "Queen" was supposed to be the Acheworld community, but the choice of metaphor is not too well veiled: by placing yourself in said perceived community, and giving it such a ridiculous status, you give off the airs of someone who thinks of himself on such a level compared to "trolls."  I would hope this isn't the case.

      Get down off the cross, lateadopter.   <br/>

If you don't want your metaphors to be mistaken for elitism, then don't use a word like "queen" as a substitute for the community you feel to which you feel a part, and people "with dog shit on [their] shoes" as a substitute for the people who disagree with you. <br/>

      What you refuse to acknowledge is that you are a member of the community, as are the trolls in question.  I am not placing myself above anyone by referring to the community metaphorically; I'm part of the same group.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What could I have used instead of "Queen?"  President, Pope, tribal chieftain, who cares?  The metaphor called for a title that everyone could recognize as "someone to whom one should show respect, following established forms of speech and behavior."  I don't like the President or the Pope, and I don't know what pets a tribal chieftain might have that could pee on a person's leg, so it had to be the Queen.

      I don't refuse to acknowledge that I'm part of this community: I can't, I'm posting here.  I just think referring to this group as something like a queen to be veering towards elitist hyperbole, which is probably not the best way to settle down a "troll."  I know you weren't trying to call yourself some kind of king of the boards; my point was that when you give this community a, quite frankly, undeservedly high status, it might seem to such trolls, etc. that you thinking of yourself to be of such high status. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I dunno, maybe next time refer to it not as a queen but your grandfather who fought in WWII or something.  Remember, as much as I like to think Onstad is one of the finest minds of his generation, this ultimately a bunch of people posting about what cartoon cats are doing.

      Holy dang, I can not believe people are complaining about Achewood's quality lately. The last few weeks have been FANTASTIC. I mean, even just looking at the ratings, half of the last 10 comics are rated 4.5 or higher. That is pretty decent if you ask me.

      I have to agree that I'd be very curious about this strip, if it was my first.  Also, if someone judges the quality of the entire comic on one single strip and decides never to look at any more ever again, well, Achewood doesn't NEED folks like that!

      This is a really interesting way to think about past & future strips: "If this were your first Achewood, would you...?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wonder if it's those difficult introductory strips that really make an  Achewood fan...someone with more time & energy should sift through the archives to create a definitive scale (perhaps entitled "The Drum Machine Manual Litmus Test"?) ranging from "most accessible" to "least accessible."
