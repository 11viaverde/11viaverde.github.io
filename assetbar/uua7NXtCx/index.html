      I disagree. Ray has been sort of stoned for the last few strips. To me this strip exists for the sole purpose of showing Ray stumbling around in the background. But of course that could just be because I love the Ray is Stoned story arc so much

      How dangerous that would be depends on which Street Fighter we're talking about. <br/> 
At least back in the SF2 days, Chun Li was top-tier... so broken that playing as her in Versus-mode was banned in my household. Wasn't a single guy in the house who couldn't beat any other character with Chun-Li. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Later generations though? She got toned down. Her Hyakuretsukyaku got nerfed, among other things. Ryu sorta took over as the standard top-tier then.
