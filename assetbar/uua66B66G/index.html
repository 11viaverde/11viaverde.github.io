      No we weren't. Not for sex-ed, anyhow. I was the kid who told my friend that if he let the older guy fuck him up the ass, that was what queers did.  <br/>

      I did the sex-ed thing when I was about 12 and they showed us some cross section pictures of vaginas and whatnot, and then a few years later we had a bit more full on session where they broke out the plastic cocks and had us put condoms on them, but really it wasn't until I was with a woman a few times that I started to get a somewhat working idea of the layout of that whole arsehole-uretha-pussy triange. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I'm saying here is that well into my teens I wasn't 100% convinced that all sex wasn't anal sex.

      I actually have done it. Not intentionally, mind you - rather, Achewood has the curious nature of bleeding into your common languange without you even noticing. One one occasion some dude at a bar was in his cups, or at least the cups that were still upright, and while chatting about this with a person of the vaginal persuasion I remarked, "Maybe the dude is from hella Circumstances." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"What?" she said. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"He's from Circumstances." <br/> 
 <br/> 
"What? What circumstances?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"You know, Circumstances. Like, he has a rough background and he's trying to drink it all away. Circumstances."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Oh," she said, and thought. "So you mean just bad circumstances?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Yeah. Yes, he's from bad circumstances." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then she said, "And you actually say 'hella', huh?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
After that everything went black and long story short I had a lot of burying to do that night. <br/> 
 <br/> 
... <br/>

      I do that kind of thing all the time. I say "hell of" and people are like, "did you mean to say hella, and if you did, why do you say that?" <br/>

      I always imagined that the kinds of girls who read Achewood would be at home chuckling in front of their computer rather than in whatever shithole bar I'd managed to wander into. The chances might be higher now that I live in a 'hip' neighborhood, but hipsters have sticks so far up their asses that even if they got the reference, they would balk at the idea that someone shares their interests and decide that Achewood is no longer cool. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Regardless, you forget that using an Achewood line would require actually approaching someone of the feminine persuasion and then proceeding to address them verbally, which is like two difficulty levels above most of our capabilities.

      But he IS treating him like a child. The way I see it, Teodor and Cornelius are kind of Phillipe's "foster parents", with Lyle just popping in to torment the little tyke every so often. The others are the ones that see him as a friend/companion. That's why T loves yelling at Phillipe and Mr. Bear takes an interest in his educational development.
