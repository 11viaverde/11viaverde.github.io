      We got a cat that the lady swore was a boy cat, so we named him Eliot after T.S.  <br/>

Well we took him in to get neutered when it came Time, and turns out we actually took  <em>her</em>  in to get [i]spayed[/i. <br/>

      Chances are, if he was born intersexed, he's not packing much these days. That adds another layer to his depression, avoidance of ladies, and severe inferiority complex when confronted with Molly's  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090810065128/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=07072003">huge condoms</a> .

      Interestingly, Molly's blog reveals that Beef does have some performance issues, such as sometimes being 'too quick on the draw'. However, despite his depreciation of himself and his abilities ('Good thing my peter is hella crappy and you don't get orgasm') is willing to learn and try out new stuff to keep Molly satisfied. Molly is a very well balanced, credible character, who recognizes Beef for what he is, and is willing to stand by him for reasons that go beyond sex, which she also doesn't seem to have complaints with.  <br/> <br/> <br/> /been typing too many essays for univ. this week, sorry.

      Remember the first time his name was mentioned though? At the part? "Roast Beef, the Middle Cat, Not Ray, Not Pat". He's the one in the middle, like the middle piggy who had roast beef. <br/>

      I have to agree with this one the most. I remember the ALT text of RB's introduction bing something like "people were asking what the name of the middle cat was". It sounded to me like Onstad glanced at the grocery list magneted up on his refrigerator and typed it in.

      I think Thommy_h is right, but basically only in the sense that that is the reason Onstad chose that name, not in a 'pre-achewood, Nibelhiem 5 years ago' sort of way. I like to think I'd have worked this out if I had any idea that the middle toe got roast beef in the traditional sense. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know that, unfortunately, it's almost impossible to over-think literary things, having done mega boring AS level english literature already. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also; those two have been friends since old times, Ray should know why he's called Roast Beef by now. Then again this is the more non-canon age of Achewood so different rules seem to apply.

      Yes my dear that can be a thing in social circumstances depending on your point of view but consider also that you do not have to put the name Charlie on your college or job applications or the like if you do not wish to. I would hazard a guess it is short for a sweet, girl-next-door's name such as Charlene or Charlotte or hell even Charmander if your assetbar name is any indication of any Pokemon predilections, or if you are from the Ghetto like myself (although I guess your birth predates the popularity of Pokemon by some minutes so you would not have the experience that many black people I know in my community being of slight Circumstances have in terms of receiving improvised pseudo-African-French names such as Laquisha or RayShaunte). So as of yet I do not have the power to say your name and force you to relinquish your claims to my firstborn child. It is not your nickname that will be any detriment to getting mad rutty in your life as it may have been in my case at certain points in my life. So buck up kiddo.

      Actually, my given name's Catherine: charlie comes from the fact that I wore a "Charlie & the chocolate Factory" shirt my first day of high school.  My assetbar name does actually come from Charmander, a nickname^2 from another friend because i'm short and rosy. I was raised in lower-middle-class Alabama, the middle child of a therapist and a guitar player who are divorced, so I have some minor Circumstances..  As far as getting mad rutty, I think my main detriment is that I am Achwood-reading, Pokemon-loving, po'white trash who is also rather short and has familial issues. Sorry if I came off as diminishing your problem, but there's no emoticon for *sympathetic shrug and pats on the back.* In retrospect, I could have just said *sympathetic shrug and pat on the back.*

      This has been discussed in the comments under another strip, but just to summarize, it seems widely agreed upon that this is why he is called Roast Beef: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Roast Beef was always, initially, the "middle cat," as he was introduced when we finally learn his name in the early strips. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the game "This Little Piggy Went to Market," the middle toe has "roast beef." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thus, Middle Cat = Middle toe = Roast Beef.

      As zefiel and vreeeee implied but did not spell out, sexing kittens is notoriously difficult, and false IDs are common.  (Hmm, is it that a [typographic] colon means a boy and an inverted exclamation mark means a girl, or vice versa?)  It doesn't help that certain color patterns are more common in one sex than the other, leading to even more mistaken sex IDs.

      Oh man a "sex ID" sounds like an ill-fated, malformed idea for a government program from the early 90s to get teens to be more responsible about sex. All posters in black and white on the bus of a male and a female teen holdin up their sex IDs. Then across town there's another one with two shiny-haired dudes holdin up their sex IDs. Then you turn on the TV and you see a commercial with Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes in black and white standing in front of an all white background talkin about her sex ID and then she walks off the screen and then those magic words appear:  <br/>
