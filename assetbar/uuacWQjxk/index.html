      Wow.  Chubby not only for what is, at the very least, an intriguing idea, but also because you have a great Kinks album for your avatar.   <br/>

I think it's been established by Onstad in interviews that he views Ray as being "black" and having a deep voice (unless I'm remembering it incorrectly), but I've never been able to hear it in my head that way.  At least, not the deep voice part.

      In Kansas I found a thirty rack of beer called "Beer 30".  It was 11 dollars, and the cans were purple and looked like grape soda. It took us a while to figure out it wasn't just called "Beer". God was it awful.

      Dude, a friend of mine with very poor taste LOVES that shit. He drinks it all the time. Good story: as some friends and I were walking down the street one day, we kept seeing Beer 30 cans, spaced out at about 100-yard intervals. I joked, "Oh, Brian's left like a trail of breadcrumbs." <br/> 
 <br/> 
When we got to where we were going, what should we happen to see but Brian kicking back with a half-empty case of Beer 30?

      Once in college, my roommate and I received a package in our mailbox and opened it immediately without thought.  We found bags of microwave popcorn, candy (which we proceeded to eat promptly) and some candles.  As we ate the note, we looked at the note.  It was from from Mrs. Stevenson to her daughter Jennie in the apartment upstairs.  It contained quite a bit of family and neighborhood gossip and a possible family secret.  We disposed of the evidence and gave our moms stolen candles.  The gossip and secrets we take to our graves.  Poor Jennie...

      When I try to imagine what the source of 'Seller's Hall' is I think it is a place where slaves were auctioned, and that Antonyne Cheops Smuckles is so old that he was the kid who handed out the programs at the door, occasionally glancing back at the men standing on the crates, all shackled from head to toe with iron heavy enough to keep down their wearied, oft-whipped limbs but not their ever-expanding souls; the boy seeing the tears rolling down their faces and reading in them the lyrics he would one day write; and knowing then and there that his son too would have to be named for a great pharaoh just as he was for there is power in names, not just for those who learn and say them but for those who give them to themselves and their own.

      Slavery ended in the US in the 1860s.  For Antonyne to have been a boy at that time, he'd have to have been born in the 1850s.  But he sang a midnight holler in 1943, which would put him in his 90s in your timeline.  I think that this is unlikely.
