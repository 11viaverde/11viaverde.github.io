      I always love reading that strip because it contains a comment from me that got a lot of chubbies which I always forget about, and then I read it and feel warm inside, then kind of dead inside because I realise I'm feeling validated by the idea of forty-four complete strangers laughing at something I said, then I remember that that's actually a pretty cool thing to happen.

once i was reading Penny Arcade, and the strip wasn't even particularly funny, just two dudes standing at a water cooler talking about somebody dying. one of them had on a shirt that says "I LIKE PIE" and i just  <em>snapped</em> . like i just suddenly needed pie like i've never needed pie before. so i went to the fridge but of course i had no pie. so i had some leftovers instead. this is really uninteresting.

      You should really keep some emergency pie around. Even if it's only one of those Hostess Fruit Pies (which, I'm told, were also very useful in foiling most of the main crimes of the 1970s) having an emergency pie is pretty important. <br/>

      Achewood was always a comic about teenage sex. Fundamentally, all of society is about repressed teenage sexual urges and our inability to successfully act on them as we wished to or having acted on them to a degree that the rest of us could only have dreamed of and living a life consistent with that in it's many ways.

      Well, that's where the issue lies. It's more about differences in age with someone below a certain age than anything. If two 15 year-olds want to make with the sexy time I think that the law ought not to get involved with that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I had a child I would (as I say now at least, having no child and desiring none ever) have no problem with them inviting over members of the opposite or same sex to engage in sexual congress in their room or to spend the night so long as they kept the noise down. No threeways until 16 or orgies until 17. You need to have some limits. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ultimately your kids will have sex if they want to. The smart thing is to let them know that this is totally normal because you did it (or wanted to, but couldn't manage to make it happen) and everyone else in the history of humanity has wanted to do the same damn thing at that age. If they want to fuck someone they're going to do it. Might as well let them do it in their own room and be comfortable about it.

      Honestly though I don't think any person that has been a parent for 16 years would say "Have sex" like you say you would.  You can say "I'll be the cool parent" but 16 years of parenthood (plus those horrific early teenage years when we all thought we were the coolest, most mature and important people ever), you'd change your mind.

      I realize that, but I also think it's important that you remember what it was like to be that age. I never did anything to get in trouble, didn't smoke, drink, or do drugs or really anything else that I can think would be a problem or that I regret having done. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also never thought I was the coolest or most mature person ever. I didn't have a rebellious phase either. Frankly, my mother was so controlling and smothering that until I went to college I didn't have a chance to go through any of that. Even at 27 and having moved 2,000 miles away my mother is still having trouble letting go. During college she'd drive two hours and just pop in without even calling.

      It is important to remember what it was like, but it is okay to be a hypocrite about sex.  My friend told me that when he is a parent and if he smoked, he would not discourage his child from smoking, even though it is harmful to the kid's health, because then he would be a hypocrite. <br/>

Everyone wanted sex at 13, but it doesn't mean they are even close to being prepared emotionally to handle it...or pregnancy for that matter.

      It's OK to pass on useful things you learned from your own mistakes. I don't want to be a dick and say I didn't make any mistakes, but I can't think of any major ones that would provide a valid learning experience for me to say "yeah, I did this and it was a terrible thing and you should really trust me and not do it". <br/> 
 <br/> 
Me, I wanted sex in Kindergarten. I can't explain it, but I never had the "girls are icky" phase, I just jumped right into the "I would totally like us to get naked together" phase.

      Ew.  Sex between 5 year olds.  Ew. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't seem to mind my parents' hypocrisy, or what I see as hypocrisy.  They never tell me they did Things when they were younger but I mean, my mom at least was pretty popular back in the day, and my dad is four years older than her, so she was the cool kid dating a senior, so don't tell me they weren't at the very least drinking before 18 (back when it was 18).  By contrast, I've never had more than a middle-school girlfriend (you know what I mean: lasts a week, kind of awkward around each other), I made out with a girl once and I only started drinking late last year (freshman year).  But anyway, my parents are both extremely sensible people and I have so far not regretted any of their parenting skills or decisions.  Maybe a few years ago when I was a bit of a little prick, I would have, but in retrospect I can say they are very very good parents, compared to lots of other people my age and their parents.  Maybe in a few years when I'm all moved out, I'll ask them about their WiLd TeEn YeArS and see if my claims hold water.

      True, but they care a lot about being virgins so it all works out in the end. They will also, likely, have either wild, stupid, uninhibited, perhaps sickeningly hot sex when they finally break down and go for it in a really dangerous and ill-advised (but did I say how digustingly hot and awesome it will be even if they think that a fun size Doritos bag with a rubber band is appropriate contraception?) or they will have the most dull, frigid, terrible sex you can ever imagine when they get married to some equally dull person who thinks that getting undressed is foreplay. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Stereotypes are such a time-saver. Though, in fairness, the last I read statistics did point to abstinence pledge types having sex at around the same time as their peers, but doing it in very stupid, dangerous ways.

      Then I'm in for a treat. All the press their first two major albums got made me want to forget about them without ever having heard a song. I call it "Yeah Yeah Yeahs Syndrome."

      Yeah, I remember when TV on the Radio's second album came out the music magazines were practically jacking off onto the page with their reviews, which for a while made me think the album wasn't that great even after I listened to it. But it grew on me over time. <br/>

This one I haven't read any reviews for, so I went in fresh but still felt it was pretty middling. <br/>

      For your meat-nerding convenience:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925100958/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide"><br/>
Sous-vide</a> <br/> 
Sous-vide (pronounced /su vid/), French for "under vacuum", is a method of cooking that is intended to maintain the integrity of ingredients by heating them for an extended period of time at relatively low temperatures. Food is cooked for a long time, sometimes well over 24 hours. Unlike cooking in a slow cooker, sous-vide cooking uses airtight plastic bags placed in hot water well below boiling point (usually around 60°C or 140°F). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rollerskate alert - "Clostridium botulinum bacteria can grow in food in the absence of oxygen and produce the deadly botulinum toxin, so sous-vide cooking must be performed under carefully controlled conditions to avoid botulism poisoning" <br/>

      Yeah, I remember when the contest was going on and now it's this huge thing. Oddly, the eventual decision was not originally the one that I preferred. I can't remember what it was now, however, in retrospect "shit-lube emulsion" is a pretty wicked thing to name a dude. He totally earned it though.

      There is a difference between wanting to see a lady in a state of undress - such as in the shower perhaps - and wanting to see her evacuate. The latter is definitely not the sort of thing you would likely be happy knowing about yourself let alone having word get around to others that it was your sort of thing. <br/>

      How do you shave your crack, exactly? I mean you wouldn't want to be waving a razor blind down there. Well maybe some of those folks daedala_x likes posting links to would, but not most of us. <br/>

It seems like it would be better to get it waxed. Or maybe "less worse" would be more accurate.

      Would not a bidet help to deal with this problem? <br/>

I was convinced a while back when I read someone saying that they found it odd that people would wash their hands, but be content to merely wipe off with a wadded handful of paper. <br/>

The inherent rightness of this statement struck a chord with me. I cannot imagine how we are not properly washing our nethers.

      Someone has developed (or perhaps only prototyped) the idea for a system of reusable warm, slightly moistened rags to be used to cleanse yourself. There is a box into which you place the old, soiled ones and it cleans, sanitizes, lightly moistens, and warms them to be used again. This is supposed to save paper. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think I can see the point of this, but wouldn't the machine use more non-renewable resources? I mean, I get the idea of not just wasting paper all the time, but we  <em>can</em>  regrow trees y'know.

      The relationship is only tenuous that I would not understand their usage. <br/>

In fact, I actually [i]do[/u] know how to use the seashells. Apparently there was some on-set discussion about the issue and it was decided upon and eventually came out. Two are held together, much like chopsticks, and used to pick away larger matter while the third is used to scrape. <br/>

      My dad is 70 years old, and he doesn't bend over so good.  He has a while-you-are-standing-up shoe buffer much like the one pictured (although it is not a Hammacher Schlemmer product).  It greatly facilitates his ability to keep his shoes in a well-polished state. <br/>

My father is no more ostentatious than any other man who was born before WWII.

This rich cat named Ray decides to drink a glass of milk by wearing 50s style clothes and sitting on his stoop, and his friend, a stuffed bear named Teodor, comes by and makes fun of him using Vietnam and West Side Story.  Ray then tells him he's turning it into a war and a musical. <br/>

The Peninsula, at least, was smart enough to build along the bay so it seems to generally be warmer and they have real summer down there and everything. <br/>

Basically I am willing to come down on any of the suburbs. Oakland, for point of reference, is a suburb as is San Jose. Perhaps suburb is wrong. They are pretenders to the throne. Cheap, venal princes trying to plot and doing so rather poorly. San Jose, though, is very suburban in it's way. Too modern of a city and it developed along the predictably suburban manner that such later-development cities often have.

      San Jose is like every business park in the world built next to every car dealership, with traffic lights that don't work when I drive through, and substandard tacquerias.  I'm told there is some there there but I think I got off on the wrong exit.  Oakland, though, is delicious.  It's a city that wants to punch you in the face and then buy you a drink.  Cheap, venal princes is only half-right.  It's also crazy.

      Well, there's both 100% chubby green and approximately 25% chubby green.  On a white background, they show up as different colours, but on a chubby background you end up with 100% chubby green the whole time.

      I know, I was just being a jerk.  I think "no ending a sentence with a preposition" is one of the most over-cited and least-understood rules ever.  Often the real complaint is not the location of the preposition, but that the preposition is just surplusage - "Where is he at?"  And with questions, the alternative is just so stilted - if I can't ask "Who is he with" am I supposed to way "With whom is he"?  I'd much rather have someone ask me "which bag is it in" than "in which bag is it?" <br/>

      Honestly, I think most of those non-mainstream sodas are non-mainstream for a reason. Sure, the exotic flavors look great, and some of them even taste good when you first open the bottle. But consider that their sugar content is usually around 38 grams, far more than regular cola (28g) or lemon/lime stuff (24g). I couldn't care less about the health effects, but this is just too much, to the point where it's no longer refreshing. And when, inevitably, it loses its carbonation and there's about 1/3 of the bottle left, the stuff is basically a disgusting syrupy goo, whereas regular cola is still somewhat drinkable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fanta Orange is pretty good. Fanta Lemon is even better, but I've only seen it in Europe.

      Nope, Jarritos pineapple is some of the best damn stuff ever. Pineapple is pretty close to the top for best fruit soda flavor. Then maybe orange. I'm big on mango, especially that Arizona Iced Tea kind that comes in those pounders, but it's not really at the top. Strawberry is next and then we get Grape. Grape is so low and so terrible that it and all artificially grape-flavored things need to be banished from this plane of existence. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would love to try coconut. Tropical fruits are almost always just plain better than other fruits. Then again I have never tasted something that was too sweet, but I have almost no tolerance for something that is sour. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You tend to see these flavors more commonly in non-American brands too so I don't think your opinion holds as true outside of the US. As above I see tons of Mexican sodas in Pineapple and Mango all the time. Then again they also think that Tamarind is somehow enjoyable in any form. That is not right.

      I remember drinking it back in the mid-90s when it was "Mucho Mango Cowboy Cocktail" then they got rid of it and I was sad for a while. Now it's back and it's cheap and big and awesome. <br/>

Actually, the shop down the block has it on special: 2 for $1.50. Mmmm... even cheaper mango soda.

      Fanta Orange is not my favorite but for some reason I was on this Fanta bend for a few days, culminating in me having probably a gallon's worth one day this past summer at Six Flags.  I'm certain it's what made me freak out when we crossed the Verrazano Bridge at night.

      No, the internet makes us all voyeurs.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Somewhere in the basement/den of an unassuming mid-sixties ranch style in the third largest suburb of Cleveland, zoom sits behind closed doors. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The water heater drips around the corner, and a dog clacks around in the kitchen upstairs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is a Mountain Dew can on the floor, behind the computer desk, on top of a tangle of wires. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The hard drive whirrs to life for unknown reasons and settles back down. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It gets chilly in the basement, and zoom has an afghan his grandma made him years ago wrapped around his shoulders.  His wife will be back from the church meeting in about a half hour.

1) I didn't watch the video for more than about 8 seconds <br/> 
2) You're adamant that I'm acting out of malice but there was no harm intended <br/> 
3) I am apologetic <br/>

      The argument is that you lost the right to get uncomfortable about people watching your video  <em>when you posted it on the internet.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
The argument is that it is baffling to me that you could feel that your privacy is being invaded when people view a video  <em>that you posted on the internet.</em> <br/>

If you didn't want anyone in the world to be able to see your video, you  <em>shouldn't have posted it on the internet.</em> <br/>

People searching for your username on YouTube probably should be the least of your concerns, compared to this: your Assetbar profile links  <strong>directly</strong>  to a LiveJournal that has the vlog in question embedded as a post on its first page.  No searching needed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're using your blog/LiveJournal/whatever as a mechanism for communication with a small group of friends, it's probably best not to link to it from Assetbar, which has ~10,000 readers (based on compete.com's guesstimate of monthly unique visitors). <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>This is a separate consideration from the ethics of posting screenshots of someone's vlog on Assetbar, which does strike me as creepy.</em>

      That's not even slightly what's going on here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is getting boring. Assetbar is becoming more of a chore than being fun. I come here to have a laugh talking to all of you about stupid shit, not be creeped out and made fun of and told I have only myself to blame because I had the audacity to have a picture of myself as an avatar. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't  <em>want</em>  to be put up on a pedestal or treated any differently. There have been several times in the past couple of months or so when people have called me "one of the best commenters here". Fuck off, am I. I'm a lot less funny or clever or talented than plenty of people here. Sure, I make the odd witty comment but I have seen some of my old comments which say really uninteresting useless stuff like "Yeah, I thought that was funny too" or something, and they've got like a whole bunch of chubbies, and I can only assume it's because of my (now long gone) avatar. I mean, come ON guys. It's just humiliating for everyone involved. I remember someone saying in one of the many feminist debates something along the lines of "women don't like being treated differently because of their appearance... unless it's working in their favour". Well, having now experienced that first hand, let me tell you that that is NOT true. As I mentioned in the video, it just makes me feel really cheap. And, guys, surely you had a chance to prove that you don't all think with your dicks, but you're just perfectly happy to perpetuate that stereotype? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, I could be wrong, it could be a bunch of girls and gay guys who think my inconsequential comments are just the best shit ever, but there we go. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not going to deny that at first it was pretty cool. It was like, wow, what a nice little confidence booster this is. But then it just got annoying. Especially when it's not even said directly to me. I have this thing when I go through the archives where I Find my username on the page so I can read through previous comment threads I've been involved in or maybe find responses to things I've said that I might have missed before. On several occasions I've found people sort of having conversations about me, and it's WEIRD. I know people get brought up in conversation quite a lot, like perhaps, "we need edwell to come along and photoshop us something" or whatever. But when it's me it's rarely anything productive. More often than not it's something about involving me in some kind of sex act. In fact that's happened on this page (aliiis made a comment about accidentally laming me and then going around and giving me a bunch of chubbies to make up for it, which was followed by, "If I followed heccibiggs around and gave her chubbies, well..!!" (this was before any of the video controversy happened, I think)). And it's just kind of weird. It's not fun to come across, it's like people talking behind your back. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Jeez, I don't know. Assetbar got a lot less fun this weekend. I don't want to have to be "careful", I don't want to have to endure creepy comments and then be expected not to complain because I'm apparently parading myself, I don't want to sit around being a subject of verbal masturbation. I just want to be treated like anyone else, but I don't really see how that's going to happen. I don't know. I didn't intend this to be like a big I'M LEAVING FOREVER CRIEZ post. But honestly, the argument to stay away from Assetbar for a while is more compelling than the argument to stick around. Maybe I'll just comment on older comics rather than getting involved with the new ones. Maybe. Or maybe I'll be back within a week. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Whatever. I'm still on Facebook and everything so, y'know. Later guys.

      Oh, man, hecci, I was just doing that same exact thing where you ctrl-f your username to see what has gone on in comment threads and that is how I found this post. There are just waaaay too many on assetbar these days and I haven't been around that much and completely missed this whole 'video' 'thing', I sort of thought there had been some dramaz with you but didn't really know what any of it was about. <br/> 
so I just wanted to say <br/> 
- man, I am REALLY REALLY SORRY if my comment creeped you out or anything! I just told that story cos I thought it was kind of dorkish that I was so mortified at laming you that I couldn't just say 'whoa sorry, dude, clicked on lame by mistake there!' and, yeah. I make reference to doing sex acts on everyone, on and off the internetz! It is a problem I have : | <br/> 
- I am a girl on the internet so I think I sort of know what you mean (I'm not famous on assetbar like you, but I do loads of photography and quite a bit of self-portraiture, for practice, and it always kind of gets my hackles up whenever I get comments on my flickr that're like "ur sexy lol" rather than, you know, 'nice lighting' or even 'I like your shoes' or... anything that's not bloody demeaning and weird. <br/> 
- It is sad for you to leave, I'm sure/I hope I'll see you around on one of the older comments threads some time or something, as after all I am still doing my Great Archive Read (I'm up to the Great Outdoor Fight... so so sweeeeeet). <br/>

      Well, that is naive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sorry, just mind-bogglingly naive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You think that stuff you put out there where anyone can look at it, freely and easily and legally, should be considered privately just because you want it to be.  And you get pissy when people you don't want view stuff it  freely and easily and legally. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yes, I would think it was weird if my boss went to a public place where I hang out with my friends.  But if I was concerned about it, I would move the gathering to someplace  <em>private.</em>   I wouldn't throw a fit about how  <em>something I did in a public place</em>  was viewed publicly.

      And if someone came up to your window and looked in, you'd just close the blinds and not complain, right? Or if someone just followed you around on the street all day? Would you be okay with conducting your entire life in private as a precaution? Are you just being obstinate? The naivete is in pretending that there is some ultimate distinction between "public" and "private". Plenty of what we consider our "privacy" in the real world comes from etiquette, not law, as most of the examples I've given are legal. We just don't think about them because they're so ingrained.

      Coming up to the window and looking in is illegal.  Someone following me around all day is harassment.  Not good examples. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do live my life privately, for the most part.  My blinds are usually closed.  But that's not the point. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I am doing something in public, I am not going to be offended or throw a fit if someone notices that I am doing it in public.  I am not going to get angry at them for noticing.  I am not going to say that I can no longer do it in public just because someone saw me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Most of the teenagers who have been in my classroom since the turn of the century  <em>don't care</em>  that I (or other adults) can see and hear the things they are doing, things that people of my generation would never do in such a way that other people could readily see them.  This is a point I make to them all the time.  That anyone can see what they have put on the internet.  That anyone can hear what they are discussing in public in a loud voice.  And they don't care.  At least they say they don't care. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I post something on the internet, I do not have some naive idea that only people I like and know and trust can see it.  I am aware that  <em>anyone in the world</em>  can view it, and will be able to view it pretty much forever.  So I don't post things that could embarrass me in a way that makes it trace them back to my life.  If you worked really hard, and did some real world legwork, you  <em>might</em>  be able to figure out who I am and encounter me in person, but I doubt it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I post stuff on other message boards, under different handles.  I would be shocked if you could tie me to my other internet identities. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe when everyone from the "pre-internet generation is dead, your vision of privacy on the internet will hold.  I doubt it though.

      Sorry heccibiggs, I'm gonna have to side with biff and theiratetirk on this matter. Coming from someone who has gotten fucked over twice by post shit on the internet that was meant for only a certain group of people and then having it aired out amongst my school, you really have to be careful what you put on the internet. Not necessarily the videos but as turk pointed out, you basically guided people to your youtube account. Considering the fact that you have a bit of a following here that is borderline stalkerish at time, you should have thought twice about doing that. <br/>

      Hecci's right. We often forget that it must kind of suck to be a girl on the internet. I propose that, instead of creeping out the couple of girls that actually post here, everyone who absolutely feels the need to stalk cute girls that like Achewood should head over to the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925100958/https://www.myspace.com/achewood_estates">Achewood MySpace page</a> . There you'll find a veritable cornucopia of girls who apparently are far less concerned about their privacy, judging from the pictures they post.

      After watching that video posting, I  <em>think</em>  I get it.  My first thought upon reading the discussion here was that heccibiggs's reaction was a non sequitur; the outrage seemed altogether misplaced, given the substance of theirateturk's post and the fact that he needed no particularly devious research to find the YouTube page in question. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Upon watching heccibiggs's video response, though, I couldn't help but note that the ire was directed at a broad spectrum of people on AssetBar and fueled by multiple past incidents of not-funny joking about stalking.  That's reasonable; if, say, hedonismbot joked incessantly about me being part of his basement harem, I'd start to get creeped out.  In that context, theirateturk's lead text, "Becci my dear," arguably was ill-advised, and his posting of vlog screenshots probably was the straw that broke that particular camel's back.

      ok, i'm gonna have to step in. heccibiggs, hate me if you will, this is not directed at you, but at women in general. from what i've seen of you on assetbar, you seem like a really sweet and intelligent girl who deserves to be left in peace if that's what you desire. also, i did not watch your video.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
now then. for far too long, we girls have wanted to have our cake and eat it too. all of the advantages that come with being a woman (and trust me there are many) we either take for granted, or feel somehow entitled to. but the minute something is to our disadvantage, we cry sexism. you don't see old people complaining about getting a reduced bus fair or a discounted meal at old country buffet. and yet, girls love to get on their high horse about the fact that being treated delicately is some sort of insult. complaining is not tactically efficacious for modifying the power relations between men and women, sorry to say. rather than harping on the various ways in which men oppress us, why not simply act? the next time a guy offers to carry your hella heavy suitcase for you, say "no, i got it, it's not so heavy" and they'll think twice next time before judging women to be weak. don't shit all over their helpfulness by getting PISSED and ranting at them. i mean, how unfair is that? i'll be the first to admit i've let a guy or two help me lift my heavy suitcase.. it's awfully flattering to have that option, even when you don't exercise it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
extrapolating to assetbar, girls don't complain when they are getting hella chubbies, or at least when they are not getting lamed for no good reason. of all the flame wars that go on, of all the stones that get tossed at an innocent remark, how many of them are directed at girls? i think that's one of the things we tend to take for granted. as for the hedonismbot thing, i personally feel honored to be considered among that harem. hedonismbot is a smart and funny dude, who is as entertaining as he is harmless, and any girl who seriously feels threatened by his remarks is paranoid at best, and completely self-absorbed at worst. when achilleselbow posted that "assetbar party" MS paintjob over the handface weekend, he included all the girls of assetbar, and only a select few of the guys. many of the girls were new, and one even stated her surprise at and immense appreciation for being included. she didn't raise her hand and proclaim on the inequality suffered by all the asset-veteran dudes who were selected against. no, being a lady is just awesome sometimes, and we ought to appreciate that and not make it into a huge political statement all the goddamn time.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
it's like the writer's rule: "don't say, show". if you're not a weak woman, show it. if you're not a housewife stereotype with no voice of her own, show it. some girls like creepy guys on the internet following them around, especially if those guys manage to do it in a clever and intelligent manner. if you don't, don't make your avatar a picture of your cute face. first ask yourself, "what don't i want?" the answer may be "people making lewd albiet clever comments about me on assetbar" or "people giving me special treatment in life because i'm a girl". ok. then ask yourself, "what do i want instead?" you might find that either you cannot come up with an answer, or that such a state would also look unsatisfactory in just as many respects, if not more.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i mean, i have this whole theory about how female inequality is not a state perpetuated by men, but is rather the result of an inter-gender tug-of-war between women themselves, with the women who benefit from the inequality pervailing at the moment, but this is neither the time nor place for me to get into that. let's just say, i agree with feminism as a movement, but not with the tactics this movement by and large employs or the beliefs about the source of female inequality this movement by and large holds. i do know one thing: we are not the victims of men, and we are only as victimized as we feel ourselves to be.

      Hey, I just didn't want my assetparty to be a sausage party. Plus, Turk had already made that collage of assetbabes, so it made it easier than copying individual avatars. Also, I think in the last paragraph you meant intra-gender? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I agree with like 100% of what you said, but this is getting less and less relevant to what actually happened. I am the last person to be accused of being oversensitive to sexism, but all I know is that when I saw Turk's post, my creep alert went off. It wasn't even that her vlog was anything "embarassing" or "private", it was just the jarring effect of having someone display stuff you've said/posted elsewhere and drawing attention to you for no apparent reason. If someone snooped around my MySpace and then suddenly posted screenshots of it here, putting me on the spot by commenting on my photos and asking why I have a Shiny Toy Guns song on there, I'd be a little irked. It has little to do with privacy and more to do with appropriateness. If a few of us had found Hecci's video channel and commented on it there, I don't think she would have had much of a reaction.

      It was, absolutely, creepy and loserish. You can go on about how naive she was about her privacy, or about how women benefit from having their luggage lifted on Assetbar and shouldn't complain when they're harrassed. That is the main thing that bothers me.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for 'if she doesn't want to be treated like that, she shouldn't have an avatar of her cute face...' I'm just dumbfounded. Yes girls, if you don't want to be the subject of the socially-stunted, knuckle-dragging, drooling ogle of a dewy college boy, the answer is simple. Bind your breasts and wear a sack! Don't go expecting anyone to have basic manners, now. Not even Achewood fans. :( <br/>

I find it ironic that this drama fell out just when we are getting a new female character. I hope she gets a chance to be decent and fleshed out.

      I wouldn't make any distinction based on gender. I'd help a male friend with something or open a door for a guy just as often as a woman. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's just about being polite to everyone. Treating women or anyone, for that matter, like they need extra help is like shouting slowly at people who speak another language. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For that matter I'm always a bit uneasy when I'm on the bus. The signs always say I'm supposed to give up my front seat when someone elderly gets on, but I totally don't want to stand up and thus imply that someone is old and feeble. I mean, I usually just get around it by sitting towards the back as often as possible (like the signs are always telling you to do... seriously people, move to the damn back of the bus so people can keep getting on. Don't just stand halfway to the back with your douchebag friends blocking the aisle for everyone) and hoping that someone else gets up first so I still get to keep my seat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I find interesting is that despite all the claims of lack of women in science and engineering about half of my professors (and the majority of the best) were female. Admittedly, biology does, for some reason, seem to attract a lot of women, but this was also in chemistry as well. I didn't take quite enough physics to yield an appropriate sample size.

      I've read a lot of unenlightened bullshit in this thread but have kept out of it on purpose because of the earlier drama. Bullshit mainly about the difference between the sexes, and while I do not disagree with your post, biff, it must be said that the  <em>average</em>  female is probably smarter than the  <em>average</em>  male, but the variance among men is a lot greater. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This means that there are more truly brilliant men than there are women. I'm not suggesting that this is a permanent thing, but I definitely believe it as long as women continue to play with dolls in their childhoods and (as children) focus on having babies as being the most important thing in their lives, it is likely to remain this way. Men on the other hand get obsessive about things, whether this is model trains, sports, cars, doing pushups, etc. etc. They get stuck in and obsess. A lot of them dont amount to squat, but the ones who do are the ones that change the world. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chess is a sport that is open to be played by men and women, but men dominate. I can't really think of any eminent female players apart from the Polgár sisters, and it was their fathers who from a very early age wanted them to be exceptional. If women obsessed as much over chess then I don't doubt that you'd have a more even spread at the top.

      Furthermore, I ain't Frederick H. Coca-Cola but the average man is undoubtedly dominated by sexual urges. Any man that tells you differently is talking shit, and probably because he wants to curry favour with you so they can fuck you and/ or other women. Women  <em>have</em>  to be smarter because they risk more if they get fucked over; they have to think about providing for another human being if it all goes wrong. People play into conventional stereotypes like these because they are there; the dumb jock, the shallow model etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And to be honest, I don't think the immediately identified problems with current gender roles are the ones to focus on. Being a mother to a child is such an important occupation that I don't believe you cannot put a price on it. It%u2019s  <em>certainly</em>  not something to feel unfulfilled about. I don't think the answer is both parents going out to earn money so the economy can flourish. That's bullshit. I don't want a stranger raising my kids just so I can make my neighbours feel inferior with a new Porsche. Speaking as a capitalist, the pendulum has swung too far. You need a stable society in order to be able to produce. You need to invest in the present in order to be able to consume in the future. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As a society we have got it in our heads that all of us need to go out to work otherwise the Chinese will take over and life as we know it will be over. We are doing ourselves a disservice with such materialism and it's a classic example of a prisoner's dilemma. We are in such a fucking race to dominate others; individuals; countries; races; religions; friends; relatives; neighbours; allies; enemies; that we all end up losing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When televised tobacco advertising was banned you'd think the cigarette companies with all their political influence would have lobbied lawmakers, but the legislature forced them to do precisely what they could never have agreed to do - all stop wasting their money on ineffective - because the market was saturated - advertising. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In order to succeed in "the man's world" women have to act and behave like men and I don't find this trait attractive at all. Aggressive businesswomen can suck my cock. I'm not saying the old way/ status quo is 100% correct; it could definitely do some fine tuning. I don't want to hold women back; if they want to go out and be the next Martha Stewart then the more power to them but I'd rather have a society in which women didn't feel worthless unless they directly competed with men. Men have a lot to learn in this regard too. You only need to look at the current financial climate to see that our greed has got the better of us. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I just think that when it's time to have children, 1) the parents need to be fairly young and 2) one parent (ideally the mother) takes a substantial amount of time away from work to be able to raise them properly.

      Right, right, women are only as victimized as we feel ourselves to be. We just get paid 75% or less of what men get paid because we feel like we do. Congress used to be 50% women, but then we started feeling victimized and our representation magically dropped to 16%. And the 1 in 4 women who are rape victims are just...what?

Interpret it as blind loyalty to my dearest hecci if you will, but it doesn't matter that her video was public. Obviously it was public and what theirateturk did was legal, but it was still creepy and rude to go post something she had put on a completely different site and hadn't linked to.

      I agree that posting her stuff somewhere else was in poor taste.  I agree that  <strong>irateturk</strong> 's decision to post it on assetbar was a bad decision.  I also still think that  <strong>heccibiggs</strong> ' reaction reflected a failure to understand the nature of what she had done, and what the possible implications are. <br/>

 <br/> 
When you post something in a public place where literally  <strong>billions</strong>  of people can see it freely and easily and legally, don't get freaked out when people see it.  That is not a realistic way to look at the situation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I did not ever, at any point, address the impoliteness and lack of grace in posting other people's work in other places.

      I interpreted daedala_x's post as being more anecdotal, you know?  The systematic forms of sexism (pay margin, and the like) is a separate issue from the day-to-day ethical "sexism" that gets bandied about between the genders.  Like, luggage carrying. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I doubt you'll get much of an argument here, or anywhere reasonable people outnumber the insane, that rape victims are victims--independent of whether they feel that way or not.  For me, I see see that as being a victim of a crime, not necessarily victims of men-in-general or some patriarchal society.  I have heard the argument though, that all women are victims of men's patronization--I think it stems from reading a bit too much into 'gentlemanly' conduct.  Not saying you believe that, I'm just explaining my reaction to the post. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When a woman --and this in general conversational terms, not in societal, legal, or systematic terms-- suggests that she is being persecuted or otherwise being failed by society because of some chivalrous act, it is ridiculous.  If a man wants to hold the door open for me, that's fine.  If a guy wants to call me honey or sweetie, that's acceptable; it is his prerogative.  If a person treats me in a special way because I've charmed them in one way or another, whether physically or mentally; most excellent, advantage: me.   I wouldn't complain if Christian Bale did it, why should I complain when the gas station attendance clerk does? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, of course, that is just me.  If you (general) don't like to be given that special treatment for being aesthetically pleasing, let 'em know.  You're well within your rights to do so.

No, the day-to-day stuff is exactly what enables the systemic stuff. Granted, chivalry is probably the least of my worries (though I do think it's bullshit), but you can't say that the small stuff doesn't count. Without the small stuff, there would be no big stuff. Without a culture that treated women as objects, children, less than human, etc., there would be equal pay and equal governmental representation, and rape would be the domain only of actual psychopaths.

      Disgusting, yes. Demented, no. Do you realize how shockingly common rape is? Perhaps you only think of rape as a man with a knife in an alleyway jumping a woman at night, but women are raped most often by friends, boyfriends, and husbands. You probably know someone who has raped a woman. Most rapists aren't antisocial people with actual mental problems. They're basically normal people who are capable of doing bad things because their culture tells them things like, "If a woman was out drinking, she should have known better, and it's her own fault she got raped," not to mention that women's bodies are public property and that women are only important insofar as they sexually satisfy men. Normal people have tremendous potential to do bad things because of culture/context (see also: Stanford prison experiment, Milgram experiment, the average German citizen under the Nazis).

      That hinges on your definition of "bad things", though.  I'd consider the concept of "public indecency" and fining people for being "indecent" to be a bad thing, but that doesn't really agree with the population at large, so who is right?  If a rape involves two people, why are the needs of the victim more important?  How do you draw a line and decide who's the victim, especially if both are drunk and both regret it later?

 <br/> 
Um. Okay, please correct me if I'm wrong. Are you literally saying that it could be okay for a man to rape a woman because he really wants to? Because his needs might be stronger than the woman's needs to, oh, protect herself from STDs and unwanted pregnancy, preserve her right to bodily autonomy, not have PTSD, etc?

      It seems as though Stereo is joking.  Also what one might consider 'rape' another might consider 'a poor choice' <br/>

If a lady goes out, gets wasted, and wakes up next to someone she would never look at sober... is it rape?  It could be, or it could be drunken adventure.

      Stereo, please explain to me either how you are NOT in fact saying that if a guy really wants to have sex with a girl and she doesn't want to, he should get to do it anyway despite her protests and lack of willingness, and basically rape is pretty much okay, OR please tell me exactly what medication you are on because there is no way someone can actually think that in this day and age and also be a sane person. <br/>

      Not all "rape" involves "protests and lack of willingness" or I wouldn't have a problem condemning it universally.  At least, I don't think willingness should be up for debate after the act.  The idea that you would willingly take drugs that distort your decision making process and then later complain when you make poor decisions honestly disgusts me.  Humans are not physically reliant on alcohol and unless the situation is different where you guys live, it's entirely optional in social settings. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A) When I ask questions, it is because I have not taken a firm position on something.  I'm here to provoke interesting responses, not reveal my personal moral values.  "The views expressed by the internet person stereo do not necessarily reflect the views of the person who is typing them" if you will.  I don't ask questions because I know the answer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
For a more pedantic response, I'm not saying that if a guy wants to have sex with a girl his needs are more important, because I didn't attach genders to either of the people involved.  It irritates me when "rape" immediately means "man rapes woman" and I think women should take a little responsibility for trying to represent the genders equally.  Any time you automatically fill in "person" with "man" or with "woman", you're extending the life of gender based inequality.

      Women aren;t only important if they're sexually satisfying to men.  I really don't think it is that drastic, if it was, why was Janet Reno ever an important or powerful woman?  I'm half-joking, but I really do think the whole "you only matter if someone wants to fuck you" angle is a little over-drawn.  An uglier woman might have to work harder to get what she wants, but really, short and balding men have to work harder to get to the top.  It is an aesthetic thing, not so much a gender thing.  The undesirable always have it worse than the pleasing.  A jobless man has a pretty hard time finding someone who wants to settle down with him, as it is interpreted a sign of instability/failure/laziness, but a jobless woman doesn't necessarily have that same stigma attached to her. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And while the average woman's body is scrutinized much more heavily than a man's, that scrutiny and judgement in-and-of-itself doesn't prevent anyone from accomplishing anything in particular.  You've just got to take it, and either give a fuck or not give a fuck. <br/>

      the rape thing though, I really think that saying we probably know someone who raped a woman is the sort of thing that gains feminists the reputation as being reactionary man-haters.  Do you think anytime someone is coerced or sweet-talked into sex that they later regret is rape?  While I agree that it's not an appropriate thing to do, to try and convince someone to have sex with you and not just let it go the first time they so "not tonight", I wouldn't really interpret that as rape.

Uh, okay, but you realize it's statistically true, right? You almost definitely know women who have been raped. Would you deny that, too?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Do you think anytime someone is coerced or sweet-talked into sex that they later regret is rape?</em> <br/>

Depends on your definition of coercion, I suppose. Sweet-talk I would put safely in the non-rape category.

      Statistically true, depending on how you're defining rape, though.  What is the line that separates sweet-talk and coercion?  "Come on, baby.  You know you want it." What is that?  I just think it's sort of a vague, gray area when you start saying that verbal coercion and convincing someone having sex with you would be fun (them giving consent, eventually, of course) is rape.  It's not a good thing to do, you shouldn't be proud, but should you be charged with rape for doing it? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Purposely getting someone drunk to make them more susceptible to your advances, while not an ethical thing to do, I don't consider that rape.  The person who is being given drinks can always deny them, and the person being verbally coerced can leave the situation.  Once they no longer have an 'out', then it is most definitely, unequivocally, black-and-white rape.

Always? No other factors go into it? No possible fear of social retribution, no social pressures, no being stranded without a ride, no vague fears of violence, no economic factors? Those are different from convincing someone having sex with you would be fun, which I already agreed with you is not rape.

      Well, you  <em>do</em>  have me there, with those types of situations.  However, I don't think social retribution and social pressure really should factor in, some things you just have to be stronger than if you don't want to be taken advantage of, and those two factors are prime examples.  If you allow yourself to be talked into unwanted sex because you don't want a group of people to think you're frigid or a bitch, that is just weakness.  Not that you don't deserve protection, but I really don't consider a person who is easily susceptible to societal pressures to be someone to pity.  If someone is convinced to buy a car that is outside of their means by a salesman who convinces them that they'll be more well-liked in that car, that is just...unfortunate, but expected.  Weak people will be coerced and convinced, that is just the way it is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
  Not having a ride and a fear of violence I think of as not having an 'out', and I really didn't put much consideration into economic factors...I think we agree more than we disagree, it's just a matter of semantics.

      Being thought of as a frigid bitch would be an annoying reality, but I was thinking more along the lines of a guy spreading vicious rumors about you that could damage your social life or possibly your career. Or an ex-boyfriend who has naked pictures or sex tapes of you could spread those around. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And some social pressures are bigger than others. If you're taught that you owe a guy sex because he took you out on a date, you might give in to verbal coercion when you don't want to, because you have been taught that's just what you have to do. There are  <em>plenty</em>  of people, male and female, who literally believe I'd owe a guy sex for buying me a plate of spaghetti at Olive Garden. I guess that brings us back to systemic stuff vs. day-to-day stuff.

      Haha, well, the average woman seems to agree, given how many of them end up married to those macho, burping assholes.  Those guys might just be reacting to a general, overarching principle that suggests acting like a big tough man will get you a woman, not actively trying to suppress femininity because they find it abhorrent. I think our gender definitions are just too stringent, and it hurts everyone.  Men can't show emotion or concern about a lot of things readily without being labeled girly, which leads to so much pent up...everything, and women--as you well know-- have a whole set of regulations they are urged to follow in order to "land a husband".  That being the most important thing in a woman's future, and all. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, I'll take their "too feminine"-branded scraps, no question.  I dig that sort of thing, mainly.

Getting a woman may be part of it, but when I watch shit like  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925100958/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubhOxoU7I9M">this</a>  and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925100958/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSERFJ24nmk">this</a>  just chilling on mainstream TV, I pretty much get the message loud and clear.

      You haven't been looking at various powerful women. There are plenty that are not particularly attractive. I'd say you have to look really hard to find a woman involved in politics that is even remotely attractive. Hence the fact that despite being only marginally attractive (in a sort of "I can see how someone might have slept with her maybe 20 years ago" way) and completely batshit insane Sarah Palin was tagged with the whole GILF thing. <br/>

Which isn't what I said. Rape is a disgusting act and anyone who would perform it is a disgusting and demented individual in my view. They might be normal in every other aspect, sure. I'm not saying all rapists are crazy schizos. <br/>

      Tekende, I don't know what your deal is. You don't have to disagree with or mock everything I say on principle. We can both agree that culture could stand to be less sexist and that rape is a bad thing.  <br/>

I'm not at all saying no man alive has a problem with rape, and you know I'm not. I'm saying its level of acceptance is still too high. I do not think you are a rapist. If you automatically extrapolate that I think all men are rapists from me saying that too many men are rapists, that says more about your lack of logic than mine.

      I think tekende was taking it to some sarcastic extreme out of pure frustration with this never-ending thread; I wouldn't read too much into it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyways, I have to be honest and ask, loneal: I know that you got fed up with assetbar and took a break because of a similar charged, socio-political argument.  I may have missed it, but the only 2 or so times I've seen you "come back" to post have been in these type of threads. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you got so annoyed that one time, and "took a break," why is it that you seemingly only come back to continue taking part in these things?  I would've thought that you might prefer to avoid these type of threads. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not trying to sound like a condescending asshole, by the way.  Maybe you like to fight the good fight against your own "better" judgement?  I don't know. <br/>

Sorry if my assumptions are wrong (ie if you've posted a lot since your break on more lighthearted fare...)

      what do you mean by "its level of acceptance is still too high"? I don't think rape is very widely accepted at all. i mean dudes don't give other dudes high fives for raping a chick. it has hella negative "WHOA!" factor. maybe for manipulating a chick into wanting to have sex with them, even if she regrets it the next day, but not for outright forcing sexual intercourse on her, that's just creepsville.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
i'm guessing you're not comfortable with me saying chicks should learn not to buy into the whole complimenting and sweettalking deal that gets them manipulated, because you'd want to say that it's the fault of society that women are compelled to seek affirmation from men in the first place. fine, we women are socially constructed to desire male affection.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. that doesn't mean we can't learn to find greater value in other things, such as career, hobbies, or intellectual pursuits. i receive far more affirmation from my professors than i could from any guy and if i had to choose between a life of academia outside the companionship of males, or a life of male companionship outside of academia, i'd choose the former in a heartbeat. one just has more meaning to me. this gets me to point 2, as i anticipate you'll object by saying that our society does not provide adequate education and resources for women to seek affirmation in ways other than through male attention.  <br/> 
2. this is a product of social structures, yes, but they are structures without an orchestrator. it is not men against women but all individuals against all other individuals, and all the intersections of their interactions and personal incentives result in the current power relations not just between men and women, but between old and young, parents and children, black and white, etc. the point i'm making is that "society" cannot provide the proper education and resources to women because "society" as "the educational system" is not a thinking entity governed by a group of interested individuals. it's everywhere and nowhere. it's US, WE create it.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
returning to the practical, let's take the example of the rape victim who is not raped in the alley by a stranger. she is in the company of a male and is not sure of her desires, and then suddenly he is on top of her, and she is frightened and appalled but too shocked to protest, or perhaps protests but is ignored. one argument to be made against her is that she should have been more cautious. rape awareness is pretty high. every university women's bathroom has been taped with "1 out of 4 women are sexually abused" or "90% of rapes happen with someone you know" flyers. i live in a pretty dangerous neighborhood where student muggings are commonplace, and there have been reports of students stabbed around campus at 3 in the morning; a phd student last year was even shot and killed. now, knowing this, if i then choose to go out at night, alone, at 3 in the morning, one might not say i "had it coming" (or maybe one might), but at the very least i chose to increase the  <em>probability</em>  of my getting mugged or injured. i can't simply claim that i shouldn't have to be afraid to go outside at 3 in the morning in an urban neighborhood, and get all huffy about it. yea, the world has crime, but i can't imagine anyone launching an "anti-mugger" campaign against people who mug, because they are just as much a product of their circumstances. again, one might resort to an attack on the educational system, but is the solution really to teach inner city kids not to mug or stab people? it's more complicated than that, isn't it? there's a holism to society's ailments that can't be combatted by concentrating on only one group who seem to be the predators, and it is no more fruitful to attack society as a governing being because society is just the result of its acting parts.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
here you might object that it is too extreme to compare muggers to rapists because muggers are somehow less fortunate and are subject to the oppression of the people they mug, whereas rapists are the oppressors of the people they rape. to this i would say that muggers do not only mug people because they feel oppressed by them, but will commit a crime when anyone has something they desire. actually, most emails we get involving fatal crimes have to do with money/drug issues among the neighborhood people themselves. second, men are in a sense oppressed by women as well. the same strong sexual urges that lead them to rape women are the urges that shackle them to the whims of women, like a terrible drug addiction. perhaps they have been used and abused in the past by women who have exploited their "addiction" and they decided to retaliate (or simply get their fix) in this way. it's a classic supply and demand problem, and a viciously circular one at that. sometimes men do terrible things. because of this, women have been taught to guard against them by remaining chaste and difficult to charm. so the supply of women becomes low. because the supply is so low, the demand grows terribly high, and men are willing to spend large amounts of money on women in order to purchase their highly-valued companionship. of course, when demand is low and supply is high, crimes will break out in order to attain the desired good by whatever means necessary, and then we have rape. but you can't say women don't benefit from this. and those women who do benefit want the system to stay as it is because they don't want to pay for their own dinner, or car, or whatever. these women are just as much to blame for perpetuating the gender divide as men are. you can't just say men should stop objectifying women and then women will stop seeking self-worth in their objectification. you could just as well say that if women stopped affirming themselves through the attention of men, men couldn't objectify them anymore because it simply wouldn't work. it works both ways.

      Dang but that is a lot of words, and I am not going to give each one a bunch of attention, but uh.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I of course think chicks should learn not to buy into the sweet-talking deal, or alternately that they should buy into the sweet-talking deal, enjoy the sex, and not feel guilty about it. I said like a million years ago that sweet-talking leading to sex you regret isn't rape.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
The structures of society do have some orchestrators. A big part of the reason disproportionate value is placed on women's appearances is so that a few CEOs can sell us billions of dollars worth of cosmetics and fashionable clothes, and those CEOs will actively and consciously try to make us feel worthless so that we will buy their products. But of course society is made up of individuals; that doesn't mean there aren't dominant ideas or groups in a society. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for your weird rape=mugging analogy, I do object, but I wouldn't have brought oppression into it at all. I would say they're fundamentally different because mugging takes your wallet, not your actual physical body. Taking objects and physically violating someone are not the same thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you're bringing oppression into it, though, you're absolutely wrong to say that women oppress men by attracting them. I have as high a sex drive as the next guy (and I've been rejected many a time, too), and I don't go around forcing sex on guys I think are hot. That's because rape isn't about wanting to have sex really badly. Men don't rape people because they're hard up - I think we all know plenty of dudes who can't get laid who don't go around raping. Rape is about power, and the eroticization of power. It's about getting off on the fact that the woman is reluctant or unconscious or fighting back against you as hard as she can. It's not about supply and demand whatsoever; at this point, there are quite enough willing girls to go around. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, just as an aside, if I were a dude, I would be insulted by your implication that I couldn't control my strong sexual urges. Yeah, that's right. I'm calling out sexism against men. It's happening.

      Oh yeah, I was just about to mention this.  Conformity and obediance.  Not all rapists are psychopaths who don't have morals.  A lot of rapists don't think it's wrong because their quarry (is that a good word?  Probably not) is viewed as subhuman, due to propoganda.  Also, a lot of feminists believe that we live in a very much rape culture, with porn, etc.  We even have paintings from the Renaissance which shows rape as something good, and late night movies where basically the woman is turned on to being raped .. . crap like that.  So I think basically a lot of people don't realize that rape is always a bad thing.

      There's this passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the raper is beset on all sides by the inequities of the raped and the tyranny of rape enablers. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the raped through the valley of the rapeness, for he is truly his brother's raper and the raper of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great rapance and furious rape those who attempt to rape and sodomize my brothers. And you will know my name is Rapey McGee when I lay my peepee upon thee. And I will execute great bukkake upon them with furious nonconsensual sex; and they shall know that I am THERAPIST, when I shall thrust my junk into thee." I been saying that shit for years. And if you heard it, that meant your ass. I never gave much thought to what it meant. I just thought it was some cold-blooded rapage to say to a motherraper before I raped a raped in his rape. But I saw some rape this morning made me think about rape . .. TWICE. See, now I'm thinking, maybe it means you're the evil raper, and I'm the cherry rapee. And Mr. 9mm here, he's the chastity belt protecting my righteous hymen in the chasm of pinkness. Or, it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm hard, Rapo. I'm cumming real hard to be in the shepherd.  <br/>

      I think the greater question is how many women run for Congress? It's not that they're not being elected due to sexism, but if you don't run you're not going to win. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You can claim, of course, that there are greater cultural pressures to discourage this or such, but I really think that's complete crap. <br/>

I do wonder why more women don't run for office though. I really doubt that being female is something that would affect the vote of the vast majority of voters.

      No, I realize that they exist. It frightens and appalls me, but the vast majority of people in this country (and likely other ones as well) are almost completely terrible. Something that I keep thinking about is the evidence shown in the last election. San Francisco is widely thought to be incredibly liberal, but it is not really so. In the last election 25% of people voted that the state constitution should be amended to prevent same sex couples from marrying. In what is generally believed to be both one of the most liberal and the most gay-friendly parts of the country. That is, from those assumptions, a pretty huge percentage of the population. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hmm... perhaps we can offer a bargain in high school. You will not be required to take any math or science courses, but in exchange you will be sterilized. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, eugenics of any type inevitably leads to problems, but as a thought exercise alone I wonder what sort of world this might lead us to.

      I'm not sure that enjoying/excelling at math and science makes people more progressive thinkers.  I am awful at math (being a girl and all TEE, HEE AND HEE) but I'm for same sex marriage.  The two really have no correlation.

      It's not so much about liberal politics so much as to counter the anti-intellectual bias. The same sex marriage bit was more about realizing that this country is often a scarier place than we think. More taking off from WoodenTeeth's claim that even in a place generally assumed to be full of intelligent liberal thinkers is not as it seems. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even if you are bad at math or such I presume that the more intelligent people will realize "Hey, math, even though I personally dislike it, is pretty damned important. I really need to try my best to learn it."  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not entirely just about people with a predilection for those subjects or encouraging progressive thinkers so much as it is going against people who think that skipping something because it is "hard" and "boring" is a good idea. We need to be encouraging intelligence, reason, and an intellectual culture. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe make it more of a tracking thing with Honors English, Intro Philosophy, and AP History included as well. I don't, after all, want to discriminate against the intellectuals in other disciplines. Science and math are just historically poor areas for America when compared to the rest of the world.

      Ah, well, in that case I do agree with you.  There is a major anti-intellectual bend in this country--too many people who think being "professorial" is a negative trait and that basing important decisions off of faith, anti-scientific thought, and superstition is good.   Wanting someone "just like you" to run the country, and make important diplomatic decisions using country wisdom and your gut.  Pretty ridiculous. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, Joe the Plumber actually managed to find a person willing to write/publish a book for him, and ridiculous opinions based on intellectual demonization are given legitimacy in public discourse everyday.

      As someone who is pretty good at math, and has spent a large amount of my life in the company of people who are good at math and science, I feel compelled to point out that there is a larger percentage of these people than you might guess who are pig-ignorant Neanderthals when it comes to social issues and equality of the sexes.

      I don't think sterilization is the best way to stimulate children to learn stuff.  You need a more systemic change in the way smart people are treated, and if America can't bring that, then maybe it's time to step aside and accept that complacency won't keep you on top of the world.  How many empires have fallen?  It won't stop. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The main thing I see is a need to reduce the amount of importance placed on sheer capital gains.  Getting rich doesn't help your country as much as getting smart, and with the system in place you certainly don't have to be smart to be rich.  How often is the opposite true?  Inventors dying poor, because their patents were whisked away by the large companies who funded their research, students failing to meet their potential because they have to take on a job to support their family, while the rich run around playing complicated games on giant meat furnaces, eating inefficient food and driving inefficient cars. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess the idea of excess and unfettered growth is part of the "American dream" but it's really not healthy to be consuming umpteen times as much of the planet's resources as other people, flying around on private jets and carving your name into as much real estate as you can get your hands on without any real goals for it once you have it.

      I don't care about helping the country, I just want to live a society where someone who suggests "Beverley Hills Chihuahua" is cast out into the frozen north. Where people never consider "not having to use your brain" to be a positive aspect in a piece of entertainment. Where we don't willingly try to be as dumb as possible almost every moment of the damn day. <br/> <br/> <br/> Also, where scientists are venerated as our new gods. I could totally get behind that. Speaking of which, did anyone see that episode of Sliders? It was terrible. It was amazingly terrible.

      I'm a cynic so it's hard to be that disappointed, but yeah, the results are usually the same. <br/>

It passed though and now we have to fight more court cases to get it invalidated because it's a ludicrously huge change to the state constitution to hinge on a simple majority. <br/>

My issue is just that, in San Francisco, I find it a bit distressing that it got a quarter of the vote. If you're not gay-friendly here then... seriously man, what the fuck? Move out to suburbs or down to San Jose or something.

      Yerah, I haven't been on the last view days, so I might not know what is entirely going on, but apparently he posted those pictures of Becci without permission.  And thta is a little creepy.  Legal, but creepy.  I'm the type of person who hates the word "facebook stalking".  I mean, if the person put the information out there, that person should not be shocked if people who are not their best friends look at it.  However, there is a difference.  This was done without permission, and . .. it just seems creepier, besides.  Yeah, this is why we need a mod.

      I so badly wanted to create a video response to this but I can't because I am kind of on a career path where my face and voice used unwisely could potentially derail my future, so I'll just write a script of what I totally had the desire and means to do, just not the opportunity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>[FADE UP on a handsome, bespectacled young black man, chubby but not obese, wearing a suit and tie. He is sitting on the couch in his parents' basement]</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
My fellow Assetbarians, I come to you tonight with an important message in regards to recent activities that have taken place on our shared forum of discussion,  <em>Achewood</em> 's Assetbar. As you are all aware, there's been a fierce controversy recently that's bringing back the age old debate between the right to privacy, and the right to douchebaggery. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As your official Representative of Black America, I have no choice but to weigh in on this important matter. This is a situation that calls for an experienced, and neutral voice of moderation, and a source of good judgment. I feel that I'm the one to take on this task. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd first like to address user heccibiggs, who recently made a video of her own to respond to what she felt to be not only invasive attacks on her privacy, but just another in a long line of grievances that have gone unaddressed. I reviewed this video and found her points to be understandable, and eloquently made. ... Well, okay, not so much eloquent. I mean...she's got a British accent. That's good enough right? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Heccibiggs. First, I want to say that for any part I've played in making you feel uncomfortable on the Assetbar, you have my sincerest apology. Over the past several months, Assetbar has clearly proven to be an echo chamber of emotionally and sexually frustrated young men intellectually masturbating into each other's sad, gaping mouths. And I'll admit: few have fapped harder or rougher than I. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some of us make an effort to make these efforts constructive -- whether it be through amusing comments, moving anecdotes, or meticulous Photoshop illustrations. Sadly, others have allowed the screen of anonymity that the Internet affords to fill their minds with sawdust and lies. They viciously attack those that are actually secure enough in their internet presence to even bother updating vlogs, likely feeling that they themselves lack the talent, expertise, or -- crudely enough -- the physical appearance they feel is necessary to get away with being "arrogant" enough to express themselves in that manner. While their actions are to be reviled, I think at the end of the day, their lives are to be pitied.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's unfortunate that we have to temper our creative desires through the lens of the envious, but the damage they can cause is too great, and often not worth the risk. We'd like to believe that the Internet houses the sum total of human wisdom, but it also has, probably in greater representation, the sum total of human idiocy as well. But considering what it is -- a vast network capable of connecting all people to each other, that can provide access to thousands of years of history, culture, and science -- it is still in its infancy. We're still mistaking some of the bugs for features and features for bugs.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So to the various trolls who've manipulated images with the intent to disparage or cause emotional distress, or the negligence to prevent such actions, I have one thing to say. <br/>

If you need some images to post here to embarrass someone, go to  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925100958/https://luckyandguy.com/">luckyandguy.com</a>  and hotlink to my comic strip. Seriously, go ahead. Make fun of it if you want to. Talk shit about how I draw in a manga style. I could care less. In fact, I could use the exposure.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'd like to thank you for your attention this evening. I trust that everyone here has learned an important lesson from this regrettable occurrence, which will likely go down on in Assetbar history as The Shitty YouTube Weekend. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Good night, and good luck. <br/>

      No, since El Goonish Shive is a completely separate webcomic drawn by a completely separate person. Although googling it has shown me that while there are superficial stylistic similarities between our respective works, there's a much greater propensity towards self-referential humor on that particular strip and much more politically-based absurdity on mine.

And note that Hecci was at the center of both extravaganzas, firsrt by using her real headshot (with hand) as her avatacon -- and causing me to be her first "stalker" when I innocently asked who her avatican picture was of -- and now she fuels controversy of the video kind.  LoneltGirl15 she is not (yet), but I think she's found a niche, the pissed off, want you don't want you, vamp for the Innernet, no, I want to be private, Great Garbo wannabe, our very own and very hear Miss Hecci.

Sorry I screwed up posting that image for you.  I somehow thought that by starting with [img] and putting [/i] at the end, you wanted me to post the image and then de-italicize it.  Wierd, huh?  Anyway, sorry about that.  Things have been weird at home lately. <br/>

The NYT site has a comments section at the end of every article, and the comment entry just asks for your name and e-mail address, and then there is a space to leave a comment.

I mentioned it before, but Jan Svankmeyer's  <em>Alice</em>  is pretty great. It's up for instant watch on Netflix even. You have to be into that sort of thing though.

      Is it really harassment?  As far as I know you can follow somebody around all day, as long as you aren't directly interacting with them.  You can peer into a window from the vantage point of a public area, like the street.  Can't go into the yard or anything, but you can peep from a distance. <br/>

      Hockey's a cruel bitch goddess.  My team (the Flames) are pretty close to injury free, but they don't play like it.  Bertuzzi's been invisible since the first month, Iggy's playing when he feels like it, and Phaneuf's -7.  How the hell does this happen? <br/>

once i was changing at a friend's apartment and i forgot to lock the door to the bathroom. in fact, it might have even been slightly ajar as it was late and i was pretty sure no one would be up. well, one of the roommates stumbled in, we startled each other, he slammed the door shut, but he totally saw me naked. later i ran into him and he apologized first, and then i apologized, and it was a huge apology-fest. <br/> 
 <br/> 
what's different here though, is that heccibiggs was not doing whatever IN OUR FACES. if you are doing something in public and someone walks by and notices, well they can't help but notice. similarly, if i am changing in someone's bathroom, leave the door unlocked, and he happens to walk in on me naked, he could not help but see me naked. theirateturk COULD help his finding heccibigg's video, and he COULD help posting it on assetbar. i think this is the relevant public/private distinction here.

      In my view, any statements that ignore distinctions show a lack of understanding. So the fact that you keep saying this shows that you do not understand the Internet. There are varying degrees of privacy, as there are in real life. If you refuse to acknowledge that there is a difference between responding to someone's comments on a forum and snooping around for a page that they have not linked to by searching their name, just as there's a difference between overhearing someone's loud conversation in the middle of a public square and deliberately listening in on a quiet conversation between two people having a picnic in a park (which is also public), then I don't know what to tell you.

      Well, if that were what had happened, I would readily admit it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Instead, someone has compared something that anyone can easily see to something private.  Has compared YouTube to email or IM. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And then, because I continually point out that YouTube is public, whether or not the poster wants to pretend it is somehow magically private, that I am lacking in understanding. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have pointed out that his totally mistaken idea is irrelevant to reality.  I have pointed out that his bizarre notion is irrelevant to me.  I have said nothing that in any way resembles "bounces off me and sticks to you." <br/>

      My whole point here is: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>Don't act all surprised and hurt when something you make public becomes public.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it is at best in very poor taste for someone to stalk someone on the internet.  To take something that intended for a small audience, and against their will, spreading it to a wider audience.  Poor taste at best. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But I also think there is no grounds for outrage and a sense of betrayal when something that was posted to YouTube is viewed.

      These are good distinctions elbow.  However, everyone needs to be aware (and I say this without a hint of conspiracy) that everytime the average person does ANYTHING on the internet, there are at least 2 other people who know. <br/> 
1. Your ISP. <br/> 
2. The Host of the site you do it on. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You need to pay attention, in particular to things like the new ISP law going in Austrailia and the provision of the Patriot Act in America that makes it so there are no consequences for the providers when they give your information out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Want an everyday example?   <br/> 
When you sign up for Google, you make a deal with the devil...fantastic services, but they come with a price and that is no privacy on anything you do there including your email, calendar, etc.  Ever notice that the ads on your google pages conform to what you have recently looked at on the internet and even sometimes things you mention in your gmail?  Did you know that Google maintains at least 18 months of history on every user?  If Google's stock keeps dropping, why wouldn't they change their stance on privacy and start selling these histories? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am not saying these things are evil or there is some big conspiracy...but you need to know it is there.  While Elbow is right there are distinctions, I would argue that you mind as well ignore them where the internet is concerned.  If you wouldn't do it in public, don't do it on the internet, unless you don't care...in which case...carry on.

      Yeah. I have little to say about the ethical issues, but hell of chubbies to History about the practical issues. I'd add: let people 'Net-stalk you all they want, and create an  <em>absolute</em>  barrier between the 'Net and your physical location. Get a P.O. Box and an unlisted land line. NEVER post a photo with others in the picture, and complain to friends who post photos of you (you can control your friends' behavior, unlike the behavior of strangers). Lie a lot, and don't be afraid to contradict yourself -- real-stalkers tend to be less bright than 'Net-stalkers. <br/>

Should it turn real, you'll lose all interest in the ethical issues, anyway. It's all pragmatism from there. Might as well get a head start--

Etiquette is still very important, but let's never forget this either. Just because you think you're unimportant doesn't mean it is unlikely to be seen by the world.

      The difference, to me, is one of permanence. I will often discuss things of this nature in public in a loud voice. It is not an issue to me. I am generally aware of where I am and who may hear me and I will adjust what I say as befits that situation. The Internet, however, is not quite the same. That is a tricky issue to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps this is because I am from the the intermediary years. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I try to keep photographs of myself out of circulation basically everywhere online and off (recently I have noted a few that are available, this distresses me, but they are not widespread and are almost never posted directly by me or someone linked to me), but aside from that it would not be hard to find where I grew up, went to high school, or the neighborhood I currently live in. My full name might be a bit harder to track down, but I tend to keep that away as well as the aforementioned pictures. To me this is as much separation as I feel is necessary. Perhaps something else will make me change my mind.

      The problem is that sometimes these things become issues entirely within the real world. When my girlfriend was student teaching she was informed that they were often concerns about how you act in public because if parents see you out they may become upset to find that, well, you act like most people would and are not a bastion of purity and education alone. Your boss, depending on your job (a friend has a boss who brings in plenty of alcohol to work and they spend most Fridays drinking at work with company provided alcohol or just going out to bars on occasion... but this is Google) may expect you to behave professionally at all times, even if not explicitly, he may form a negative opinion of you based on your private life. <br/> 
 <br/> 
These are problems with people and not just online/offline issues. In this case it was tricky and both sides were a bit wrong. Yes, it is the Internet and things will show up everywhere. Expecting them to remain private is naive. At the same time, keep it in context. Posting it to Assetbar was perhaps a bit odd and I can see how it could come across as invasive and out of context. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the bigger issue is such as potential employers trying to track you down online and judge you. They are crossing the line. That would be, to me, the real world equivalent of hiring a private detective to follow me around. It is creepy, disturbing, and a massive violation of etiquette. Yet many employers think nothing of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the other issue is that we often still operate under the assumption that our intended audience is the only audience and these things will not transfer out of that. How would many of us feel if our parents were to start following what we say here? This would feel as odd as if our parents were eavesdropping on any other conversation we may be having with friends, but we neglect to realize that it is entirely possible for them to read what was said on Assetbar well after it has been said, unlike in reality.

      But that's precisely the point. Just because something is  <em>possible</em>  doesn't make it  <em>right</em> , and I would argue that for your parents or your boss to follow you around online is just as  <em>wrong</em>  as eavesdropping on your phone conversations. There is no difference. The problem is that people like Biff try to proclaim that the Internet is just this completely ettiquette-free zone where everything you do should be treated as if you were shouting it out to the whole world, and the only possible response is "what did you expect?" That is what is ridiculous to me, because you could just as easily make the same statements about anything you do in real life that is not done entirely within the seclusion of your own home.

      No, he explicitly said that Hecci "forfeited any right" to be angry when she posted something to YouTube. Perhaps it was a poor choice of words, but there is no other way to interpret that. I outlined several distinctions between public, private, semi-public, and semi-private in both real life and online, which he refused to acknowledge.

      I'm going to use analogy in an attempt to break through to you here, Biff, just as was done by our lord the Jesus so many years ago. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are on a bus having a conversation with your friends. Now, it may be that Americans have some fancy public transport system with sound-proofed cubicles, and it may be I'm being overly presumptuous in thinking that you have any experience with communal transport, rather than owning three constantly idling 4x4s and a horse, and thus I will explain the situation in detail. The bus is crowded. You and your group of friends are sandwiched in, a pair of romantically intertwined teen parents and their wailing children on one side and a tall, gaunt man who is gradually, perpetually tearing out his beard hair on the other. In this situation, you accept that while your conversation may be at a perfectly reasonable volume and quite personal to you and your friends, but seeing as no-one else on the bus is talking, and given that at their distance they can all likely hear you quite easily (Except the student at the back who is glaring at whatever is currently beyond the window and listening to System of a Down loudly enough to make his neighbour worry that they have tinnitus.) you are resigned to the fact that they will all likely be listening to your conversation. They might not be trying to, they might not want to, but they are and if the roles were reversed you would probably be unavoidably paying them the same disrespect. This is no-one's fault. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In this fable, the bus represents YouTube. It is a public forum, and you accept that, given the nature of the system, your personal conversation will likely be heard by others. This you cannot help. You want to talk to your friends, and it is while you are on the bus that you can best manage this. You expect the undesired audience to sit there, take in the few personal details revealed as a means of judging you, and then get off the bus and promptly forget all about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In this metaphor, The Irate Turk is the bearded man with the maggot in his brain. He often gets the same bus as Hecci, and watches her whenever the frequently bra-less sports student isn't in attendance. He, unlike the other bus patrons, does not forget about the conversation. Rather, he hides a tape recorder in his jacket pocket, transcribes the information gained when he goes home, and then puts it on a number of posters and sticks it up around Becci's favourite cafe. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I appreciate that the magnitudes of privacy and offence might vary, here, but try to see that Heccibiggs has as much right to be be annoyed that her semi-private conversation has been drawn to the attention of a group of people for whom it was not intended, as Bus-Hecci has a right to be slightly mortified that every Starbucks visitor of that morning has been shrewdly informed of her reaction to the occurences on X-Factor. YouTube is the best video hosting site available, and it doesn't (as far as I'm aware) allow you to render videos private. Or maybe it does, but it was awkward for Hecci to do so while allowing her blog audience to still see it easily. Hecci probably isn't upset that her video has been seen by others, she's likely resigned herself to that fact. The transgression in this case is that the Irate Turk, in his naivete, has made the effort to track down a video of Hecci and then, in his thoughtlessness, has broadcast it specifically towards a forum of people that Hecci herself had no interest in showing it to. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And if you've just been maintaining this argument in an effort to stay in character with your iconatar, this has all been for nought.

      See, the problem is not breaking through to me.  The problem is not getting me to understand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem is that  <em>you</em>  don't understand.  The problem is that YouTube is not private or semi-private or kinda private or even a little private.  YouTube is as public as it as possible to be.  Unless you are tapping directly into people's brains, it is not possible to be more public than YouTube.  It is not possible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As long as you hold the fantasy that there is  <em>any privacy at all</em>  in YouTube, you will continue to fail to understand.

      I'm not certain as I don't recall that conversation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am just saying that since he doesn't really do topical strips and often works in longer arcs recently it would be a good idea to do a week or two worth of strips in advance and then dole them out two or three times a week on a regular schedule. He can use the time to work on strips for the future and thus stay on time. This is, I believe, what most professionals and steady web cartoonists (who keep to a regular schedule, have time-consuming art or are not just insanely fast, and are not topical) tend to do.

      When a girl wears a skirt, in a way she is opened to the world.  I mean, there is nothing separating her undies from the outside world.  She has to rely on point of view; most people walk with their eyes well above any vantage point that will give them a good view. <br/> 
Perhaps the girl should not be wearing a skirt at all, and it is her fault if a man takes a picture of her with a camera.  Or perhaps the man is a perv who violated her expectations of privacy.

      What about when a lady does not wear undergarments beneath her skirt? Is this because she wants people to look? Will she derive a secret joy from this (or an open joy? Or just plain old regular joy?) perhaps? Is it because it is intended for a special person (or persons!) and not for general consumption? Does it make her feel daring knowing that someone could look, but she is too shy to want them to actually do so and it is all in the tension? Was she just in a hurry, likes the feeling of freedom, or ran out of clean underwear? Is she just really worried about panty lines? <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are lots of issues going on here and not all can be ascertained easily. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is also taking it to other areas. It's not like someone posted her erotic fanfic to Assetbar. It might be closer to just linking to her high school yearbook (assuming it was online... tracking it down in meatspace, scanning it in, and posting it is a rather involved amount of work that just makes it extra-creepy). It was clearly public, but it's still creepy that someone brought it up here.

      Actually, while a lot of Americans are certainly unlikely to be familiar with actually riding on the bus you're ignoring that almost every public transit trip will involve at least one person talking either very loudly into their cell phone or talking very loudly to their douchebag friends on the bus with them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
People seem almost entirely unable to control the volume of their own voices. Why is that when everyone in, say, a restaurant is being loud nobody else is willing to speak a little bit quieter to the people near them instead of just shouting more and making it worse?

      Her main argument is this: she posted a vlog for her friends.  If other people saw it, it wasn't like she said "HEY CHECK OUT MY VLOG!!!  IT'S AWESOME" but because we are all sometimes curious about someone's comments/profile and want to know more.  Everything was fine until irateturk decided to put her face on here.  Sure she made the decision to make the vlog but irateturk was wrong in posting images like a goddamned shrine to her.  It does almost seem stalkerish and freaky.  We all have different comfort levels and irateturk definitely crossed hers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So, to sum it up: Heccibiggs should have been a little more careful in making up an account with a name that she didn't exactly use her name or comment with that username on a place most people would know her.  Irateturk shouldn't have been a dick and posted her photos as that was a violation of her privacy (she can violate her own, you can't do that for her). <br/>

      well that doesn't make sense because her av is a picture of her.  <br/> 
Certainly the point isn't how careful she was about her handle; she shouldn't have to take that kind of thing into consideration.  The thing is that she mentioned the fact on this very forum.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I guess I'm confused by this because I didn't realise people were making so many comments about stalking as a joke and chubbying girls' comments based on  the fact they are girls, or are considered cute. That's infantile. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Apart from that I thought this is what the internet is FOR. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You find a thing you like. There is a community that shares their appreciation. Someone in that community has an interest you share. You investigate that interest.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's stalking? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I agree turk's posting of your video here was inappropriate, especially as it was unrelated and therefore probably not very interesting to most people here, so there was no real point to it. However it seems to have been a catalyst for a reaction that was meant for the Assbar at large. How he came to find that video should not be the subject for vilification. <br/> <br/> <br/> I don't want to seem like I'm arguing with HB's point of view, just the arguments and analogies used to defend it. The internet is NOT the street, the very anonymity of it is exactly how and why people find things and other people they would not otherwise. <br/> 
And trying to drag a 'character poster' like hedonismbot into is hardly appropriate.  <br/>

      Yeah, a friend of mine is someone I met because they were on the San Francisco group on Last.fm and linked to their LiveJournal in their profile. I followed the link, they seemed interesting, and had posted something recently about how all their friends were out of town for the summer and they weren't really doing much, etc. I had only recently moved to the city and didn't know many people, we struck up a conversation, and now we're friends and I'm moving into her former apartment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At the same time it could have come across as totally stalkerish and weird. I was just looking for people nearby that shared similar interests in music that I could be friends with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ultimately we need to acknowledge that this is a very tricky and delicate area. Sometimes things work out, other times they don't. We're all still getting used to how these things work and a lot of us here on Assetbar are still doing some growing up and getting used to the world at large, let alone the complex area of personal relations on the Internet and how this relates to the rest of the world.

      <strong>Quote:</strong> <div style="margin:0px 10px;padding:5px;background-color:#F7F7F7;border:1px dotted #CCCCCC;width:80%;"><em>Usually the people I've heard saying things like this ("your boss can see your MySpace page!") are of the pre-Internet generation, so I can see why they wouldn't "get it". The thing is that for a lot of our generation, not just the nerds, the Internet is synonymous with your life, not some "public" domain that can be separated from the "private" things you do offline. It's the main way of keeping in touch with friends, finding out about events, and interacting with people. So to tell someone, for instance, that they should be careful not to post anything online that could make them look "unprofessional" is basically saying that they shouldn't have a life.</em></div> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have a different perspective on this, based on my experience as a member of the transitional generation that built the web and thus opened the private/public Pandora's Box that you decry. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is reasonable that you want to keep aspects of your life separate.  It isn't necessarily easy, though, whether on the Internet or out in the real world.  When you apply for a job, it's likely that your prospective employer will search for your name.  Google isn't selective; it will show both the paper you published at a conference (thus making you look like an exceptionally well qualified candidate) and your MySpace page full of drunken photos (thus making you look somewhat less qualified). <br/> 
 <br/> 
This highlights, I think, a fundamental difference between the Internet and real life.  In real life, your boss would have to travel to your local pub to actively pursue details of your weekend activity.  In contrast, the Internet brings the pub to your boss--who didn't even have to be actively looking for it at the time.  In the real world, it's possible for your activity to be broadcast to people who know you but weren't actively trying to track you down--imagine your luck, for example, if you call in sick to work in order to go to an afternoon baseball game, only to find your picture in the newspaper because you were sitting in front of the kid you caught the game-winning ball--but it's much more likely on the Internet, where search engines cast a wide net. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In my real-life job, I do often search for the names of job candidates who've applied for positions in my department.  If I find stuff relevant to the position for which they've applied, it helps me better understand the applicant's experience.  And what if I find search results not relevant to the position?  Well, my personal approach is to subdivide "professional" vs "nonprofessional" into two independent dimensions: "work-related" vs "non-work-related" and "jerk" vs "non-jerk."  Stuff that's non-work-related doesn't bother me.  (Again, this is my personal perspective, although most people I've encountered in my industry seem to operate according to similar principles.)  If someone applies for, say, an engineering role and the first ten search results for their name are from anime fan fiction message boards, I really don't care.  But if their top search result is a blog rant entitled "an open letter to all you fucking ignorant assholes who hate fan fiction," I'll have serious concerns about whether that person will be able to interact with colleagues in a constructive manner when under deadline pressure.  Similarly, if their LinkedIn page says "I worked at XYZ Inc. for just two months because they lacked the intelligence to understand my vision," even though that particular corner of the Interweb is directly related to that person's professional life, it suggests a data point at the wrong end of the jerk/non-jerk continuum. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The walls you hope to maintain between your different online personas are likely to be breached in plenty of non-career situations, too.  After that blind date that goes surprisingly well, your potential new significant other is going to google you and form judgments based on what shows up.  And the first time your parents start using the Interweb, they'll probably search for you also. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In all these situations, the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925100958/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_Principle">Robustness Principle</a>  seems like the best policy.  Be liberal in what you consume (i.e., judge someone's online presence by whether they're a good citizen of the communities they inhabit, not by your own prejudices about those communities) and conservative in what you publish (when posting something in a public community, assume that it will be consumed by people outside that community).

      Those are all good points, but you have to realize that if everyone were so careful in what they publish, Internet communities wouldn't be able to exist, or at least they would be severely restricted in the extent of the connection that could be formed among its members. I have a huge problem with any philosophy that would make something like the Handface Weekend impossible, because regardless of some of the shit that has followed, it was awesome and a glimpse of what the Internet should be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know some people who, having taken all these precautions to heart, have converted their Facebook pages into nothing more than virtual resumes. This strikes me as incredibly sad, another triumph for soulless capitalism. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My whole point was that the online/offline distinction is already somewhat meaningless and will only become more so in the near future. Google already has images of the entire Earth, down to being able to see the numbers on your house. More communication will happen online, and more of the "real" world will be captured on the Internet. As these methods of surveillance increase, are any outlets for self-expression going to be fair game for judging your "character"? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925100958/https://xkcd.com/137/">this xkcd comic</a>  sums it up pretty well.

      I concur. I tend to think it's a bit of a dick move for a potential employer to try and search you out online. They are intentionally prying and it's not really appropriate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I try to keep this separation by keeping my online handle out of anything business related and by having a name so generic that I cannot find myself online using it. Even using my middle initial only brings up tons of people with the same name. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize that this isn't going to keep me entirely safe, but I feel that it's the best I can currently do.

      Glad to hear someone coming from my side of the fence, Mr. Void.  I'm in the same boat you are - involved in the hiring decisions for my team - and I'll be honest.  As soon as I've picked through the resumes HR drops off, and have thrown out the obviously non-qualified, I google the name and the given email address of the applicants.  If the search gives me a Facebook or Myspace profile, I look at it.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
To be clear: I'm looking - and only looking - for obvious deal-breakers, stuff that's easily found and, frankly, has the potential to embarrass my company.  Like featurelessvoid, I'm trying to get a feel for any assholish behaviour I can expect in the future.  You use your best judgement, too.  Kid fresh out of university has some pictures of him and his buddies gettin' tanked at the campus bar?  That's expected.  35-year-old's got pictures of him grinding a coed at the same bar, wedding ring in full view?  That's a headache in a suitcase. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It ain't fair, but that's life...so if you've decided to document your life online, don't expect the reactions to be fair.

      I think it's inappropriate, however. They also provided you with their address, does that now make it acceptable to wander over to their house and check out their yard? Maybe hang around for a while and see what you find out? If they perhaps speaking loudly on the telephone with their window open wouldn't it be inappropriate for you to listen in? What if they were obviously talking about something you judge to be inappropriate? <br/> 
 <br/> 
People have the right to have separate personal and professional lives regardless of their profession (yes, even politicians unless they do something that amazingly impacts on their career like, say, being strongly in support of anti-gay legislation and then trying to get a blowjob from some dude in an airport bathroom). You have decided to go peering into their personal lives which you have no right to do.

I'm sure if I did some in-depth investigations of the manager at the local big box store, say followed him around after work (being legal, and all), I'd find something a wee bit sordid. As is for everyone. <br/>

      I think it can be more than that. I have a right to have personal opinions that, while I may share them on the Internet, are not privy to my employer. There are plenty of things that I may be strongly in favor of, but which I will keep quiet about at work out of a need for professionalism. I see the ability for discrimination to be astoundingly high here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not to mention my right to be critical of my workplace and co-workers (or previous workplace) without someone then going over it in the future and failing to hire me because I'm not a  <em>team player</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
Generally if I have a problem with a co-worker the only reason I'm not calling you a fucking dick to your face is because I realize the need to get along together at work and I can deal with that. I still have the right to loudly call you a fucking dick elsewhere by name and not have you prying into whether I might be doing so in a semi-public space.

      Bring it up with the potential employee to make sure it won't be a problem, maybe.  Unless there are photos of them engaging in the kind of illegal activities that result in serious jail time, I can't think of much on the internet that would necessarily have an impact on their performance at work. <br/>

I think the difference from Internet and public spaces is permanence.  When you say something in a park, the next million people to visit that park don't all get a chance to hear it.  But when you post something on youtube, it's there until you take it down, and people are going to find it if it's in any way connected to you.  I personally go to extremes in keeping all personal information hidden (the more specific, the less likely I am to ever mention it).  Part of it I suppose is being judged on merit rather than presuppositions, it is not always an improvement (trans/ambiguous gender particularly frowned upon in some circles) but generally I find that easier to deal with than all the preconceptions and biases linked to either of the popular genders.

      That's a ridiculous analogy, mainly because putting up posters of yourself on a billboard is not a normal activity and thus would warrant attention in itself, whereas having a vlog is entirely normal.

      I worry that most modern users are just doing so because it was used in The Big Lebowski. This makes me sad. <br/>

People also rarely expectorate these days. Well, outside of medicine that is. Nor do they spark with their best gal. <br/>

Actually, what always amazes me is just how dirty heavy petting really is. I had always assumed it was more of a second-base Advanced Make-outs sort of grope and fondle-fest, but no. No, I was wrong. It is about cold rubbing someone off. We must never underestimate how filthy people have always been. <br/>

So I hadn%u2019t. And so the first thing I do is buy Finnigan%u2019s Wake and read a chapter. And it%u2019s great, you know, and I dug it, and I felt as though he's an old friend.

      Hardly a ringing endorsement. If reading a chapter of Finnegan's Wake qualifies, sure. The Beatles were poor-class kids from Circumstances, hardly avid readers. <br/> 
 Not to say they were dumb, far from it. <br/> 
 Maybe John better liked the version of Tim Finnegan's Wake as sung by the Clancy Brothers. They tip their fedoras Joyce's way when they preface the song with a reference to Joyce seeing a simple ditty as " the meaning of Life, Resurrection, The Universe!" to laughter among the audience. Then they burst into a rollicking, delightful rendition including a wake brawl, Tim sitting up indignantly. <br/> 
 All I needed from it in was that song. <br/> 
 I'm not going to knock Joyce, I never read him enough to have the opinion, although I tried. His style put me off. <br/> 
 I'd just take this moment in time to say it's far better to live your life than read others' stories and descriptions about "life"- in fact, there's no comparison....although surely you can do both.

      Not really an endorsement, more like he was digging what Joyce was doing.  He only read Joyce after people remarked how similar Lennon's books (A Spaniard in the Works, In His Own Write) are to Joyce's .. . althoiugh Joyce's is a lot more advance.  Lennon's books (written before he was famous) were just very absurd/surrea/not really sure.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said, I don't live my life, but rather than read other people's descriptions about other people's lives, I get immensely jealous and just bury my head in difficult tomes filled with despair.  And stuff.

      Let me just say this true story: <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the way to a Radiohead concert, on a highway on which everyone else was also going to said concert, traffic was getting very bad. Cars were barely moving, tempers getting frayed, and the iPod playlists were starting back over. As we sat at a standstill, I happened to see some commotion in the center lane. Three hipster looking girls got out of a new Beetle and the center girl drops her pants in the middle of the road and squats and begins to pee profusely all over the road, side of the car, and herself. Her two friends held her up. Then they got back in the car which was still not moving due to the shit traffic. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Here is the disturbing part: the girls, though probably a bit tipsy, acted as this was the most normal casual thing to do on any sort of Friday. Peeing all over yourself in the middle of a crowded road with thousands of people all watching, many of whom you will probably see again in the crowd at the concert. They smiled and looked calm, even serene.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Seeing the stew is not a thing to ruin an opinion of a girl, but when urine is pouring forth from it directly and openly in front of you...well...lets just say that we should hope for all our sakes that our good friend Ray does not partake in such viewing.

Step One: find an isolated area with foliage if you can, but any space with a 2'x2' of ground and no cops will do in a pickle <br/> 
Step Two: quickly pull down pants OVER your knees, and squat <br/> 
Step Three: form your hand into a "C" shape, as if you were about to grab an escaped hamster, and use this hand to grab the "crotch" region of your pants from underneath <br/> 
Step Four: pull the crotch region UPWARDS, that is, in a motion parallel to your torso and away from the ground <br/> 
Step Five: piss furiously <br/> 
Step Six: wag your bottom left and right in a one-two-three motion to dispel any remaining droplets <br/> 
Step Seven: pull up pants and jump back into cab <br/> 
Step Eight: ignore scowls

      Deadala, you should have a whole series on PBS.  How appropriate you use the image of capturing a hamster, given a recent Assetbar exchange on genital nomenclature.  One could also use the identical "C" hand form to capture a trouser trout, albeit with a different orientation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One suggestion:  In Step Six, you might recommend the degree of vigor required for successfully wagging away those errant drops.  A lackadaisical wag would undoubtedly result in unpleasantly moist undergarments.  That would result in universal scowling. <br/>

      That golden glistening stream, the dainty tinkling sound, the way that she squats ever so gingerly and wipes quickly, almost furtively, as if slightly ashamed yet mischievously pleased at what she has just done; one imagines her lightly putting her hand up to her mouth and softly giggling "Oops!

 <br/> 
Keep in mind if and when you do settle down with a woman, that 20 years from now, she'll still be pissing like a horse on a flat rock, while you'll be enduring your personal physician's cold, gloved forefinger up your ass to check your prostate's viability and short-term prospects. Which will likely make you Happen to yourself. <br/>

      Your first reply implied that you thought I was somehow disparaging the idea of a girl pissing and were drawing on your extensive life experience to declare that it is a perfectly normal and natural thing. That's the only way I can possibly conceive of your little rant making a modicum of sense, other than you simply wanting to brag about how your daughters can kick my ass. Speaking of which, congratulations on your innovative use of Internet Retard Cliche #354. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So literary references are for assbags... insecure much? In any case, no, it was just me going along with Tekende's post. I'm flattered that you would compare me to Eliot though. I wasn't going for the Nobel here, but the fact that you lamed me suggested not only that you "didn't think much of it" but that it somehow offended your tender sensibilities, which is what I was jabbing at subsequently. A playful jab, in response to which you opened a can of dumbass. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still am not quite sure exactly what your problem is, though I find myself caring less and less. I leave this discussion even more firmly convinced that age does not equal wisdom.

      what's with the hostility scorpio? achilleselbow was simply making a facetious remark in response to someone else's facetious remark. if that isn't assetbar's one dollar bill, then i don't know what is.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
i found his "prosey description" amusing, and i can understand if you didn't, but why threaten him with "handing him his ass in a bag"? why can't we just all be friends?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
also, i just imagined my father referring to me as "intimidating" and telling some young man online that i could "hand him his ass in a bag", and i don't know how i feel about that. not that i wouldn't do it for him. but, ya know, that he's not only privy to but visibly proud of my ability to kick asses.

      I'm pretty sure I'm not being hostile, daedala. I thought he was into having a pissing match, since he was invoking me and being rude about it. Maybe he oughtn't do that from now on. <br/>

 He still hasn't explained what he meant or expected, so how do I know except what I read from it?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 My take on his post was that it was disparagingly assholey. Maybe I'm too  <em>fill-in-the-blank</em>  to go hyuk, hyuk, hyuk, wink-wink.  <br/> 
That's what the ass in a bag was about. I wasn't threatening him, and I don't need my daughters doing anything to anyone. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 I'm telling him there's plenty of women got way more balls than he does, so he ought not to strut such crap.   And to answer your unwritten query to that, boy, you've shown way more than enough vapidity for me to make that value judgement. Easy call. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I still don't know what he meant, and I'm guessing he didn't either, since he hands it off saying it's Tekende's thing. Maybe that's what passes for humor on the achewood b-board. I can pass it by, just don't ask me by name to laugh at or applaud your juvenile stuff. <br/>

      Have you guys seen that Magic : The Gathering is advertised on regular people television now?   I don't know how to feel about it; maybe they're looking to cash in on the popularity of World of Warcraft as of late?

      It would be even better with the old 'T' to tap symbol. <br/>

I tried to get back in a few years ago, but it didn't entirely take. I only originally played from around the time of The Dark up until Mirage had just come out. I swapped over to the old Decipher Star Wars CCG and played that from A New Hope up until Bespin had just dropped (not long, true, but I ran out of people to play with). Haven't been back to CCGs since. I'm glad. Costs hell of money and my once pricey set of Nightmares, Demonic Hordes, Demonic Advisors and others from Revised and Unlimited just aren't really worth so much these days.

      I figured you'd be more of a blue "control deck" type, but black suits you as well. I only played from around Mirage to Stronghold - had a green deck and a white one, and I always got my ass kicked.

      Nope. I see what you did there and yeah, I can be controlling and picky in reality, but not in Magic. I played a lot of black, some red, a bit of white, and a decent amount of green. Blue was always just a seasoning. Blue and green was often nice though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Odd that I liked black because I never sacrifice anything in any games and I'm not willing to take a loss for any sort of gain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Hmm... now I'm thinking about my old mono-red goblin speed deck.

      That's probably the key to enjoying old age -- still having working parts you favor.  My 20/20 vision went in my 40s, and now I can't hold the newspaper far enough away to read it without glasses.  Minor bummer, reading glasses are 3-for-$12 at Walgreen's.  Then my sense of smell mostly left, no great loss, since the world stinks.  I would hate to lose my potency, of course, but could always become a monk.

      I have yet to find a doctor who will agree that knee replacement is warranted.  And that is the only kind of surgery currently available that can solve my particular problem.  Some parts of my leg are different sizes that the other parts.  They don't fit together right, and all the strain hits my knee joint and causes critical parts to wear away at an alarming rate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If I hadn't regularly taken the stairs up to the 30th floor for years in my late teens and into my 20s, things would probably function better now.  But the congenital nature of the problem made it inevitable at some point in my life.

      Meh, I don't have siblings and never had family holidays growing up. It was just me and my parents. I think this was the best way. Now it's even better because I don't have to see my parents either. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will never understand the idea of people seeing relatives on holidays or basically at any other time. My girlfriend likes her relatives (and unlike me, knows the relatives that exist on her father's side... I have basically no idea how many siblings he even has) and actively wants to spend time with many of them. I find this impossibly strange.

      I have many relatives on both sides and see them only rarely. I don't understand why I HAVE to see them at all. There are maybe three I enjoy spending time with.

      I think she got it right more or less. Cornelius is friends with Ray, but he is not above being able to see that he is essential a rich buffoon of generally low mind. He isn't really even  <em>nouveau riche</em>  he is lottery winner rich. He was upper-middle class suburban wealthy and has now become Soul Sellingly Rich and has brought along many of the main problems of America today if we had the money to act on them more often.

      One time when I was 11 me and my friends Greg and Jimmy decided that the best way to get rid of Jimmy's rotten old stuffed animal collection was, of course, through liberal application of fireworks. Nevermind that me and Greg were total pyros and had spent hours dissecting fireworks with the care of psychotic surgeons. That was totally the mature decision.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
So we took a bunch of our homegrown explosives out to a little copse of trees next to a very popular highway. The first one was really cool, it was a bunny head we had stuffed with the charge of a mortar, you know, the first explosion that shoots it up in the air? It unfolded the bunny's head until it was like a mask. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then we decided to try the bear. The bear we stuffed with the actual mortar sparklers, what explodes about three hundred feet up in the air. Except it wasn't three hundred feet up in the air. It was in a stuffed cotton bear, in the woods, next to the highway. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once we lit it it immediately registered on all of us what a stupid thing we had done. Seriously, it was like that moment where the rock you threw punctures the beehive and small, angry, shiny things come flying out. I dimly recall running and screaming through the woods with bright orange embers raining through the trees, hissing like adders as they met the undergrowth. Though I had not yet seen  <em>Platoon</em> , the imagery was comparable.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
We never did find that bear. Fucking thing just evaporated. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And that's my story about abusing stuffed animals.

      i have a condition where i assign life to inanimate objects, especially stuffed animals. i used to work in a toy store, and whenever a teddy bear was missing an eye or his little jacket because some kid had bitten it off/drooled on it, i would take it home when no one was looking before they could throw it out. i feel bad for neglected stuffed animals especially. if i find one in a parking lot, i take it home. if i see two left outside a 7-11, i take them home. if i see some particularly sad-looking ones at the Goodwill, i take them home. <br/>

      Oh my god, I was insane about inanimate objects as a kid!  whenever I used to eat Teddy Grahams my dad would say, muffled, "nooo chelsea why are you eating us noooooo we just wanted to live and be your friend!!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I didn't eat animal shaped foods after awhile, which makes a kid's choices kind of limited. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also had a cup that had a little Tigger at the bottom of it, so when you filled it up with milk or something, my dad would say "HELP ME I'M DROOOWNING GLLLUUUHHHGGGG AHHH" so I'd drink it faster. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was ridiculous with stuffed animals too.  They always had to be facing something, or at least facing each other, so they could talk.  Never put face down or anything, and I'd cut the tags off because they were uncomfortable for them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You aren't alone, I think it is sad to see abandoned animals too. <br/>

      There must be different versions. <br/>

In the version I read to my kids, the kid got better, but the doctor said to incinerate all his stuffed animal toys to prevent reinfection. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But some mystical creature interceded, and turned the Velveteen Rabbit into a real rabbit, because the boy loved the rabbit or because the rabbit loved the boy or some other such twaddle. <br/>

I only read it to them once, decades ago, so I don't remember the details.

      When I was a kid I was a huge fan of  <em>Chip N' Dale's Rescue Rangers</em>  so when McDonald's came out with a happy meal that had the Chip N' Dale's toys I ordered two so that I could get Dale and Gadget. Unfortunately, I wound up with two Dales so I just pretended they were Dale and Gadget and Gadget would be all, "Oh, Dale, you're so funny, you're not all gruff and mean like Chip who's always sending you to bed without dinner when you draw in his newspaper" and Dale would be all "Aw shucks, thanks, Gadget, you know the favorite part of my day is when you give me a bath and read to me and night" and sometimes I would forget which Dale was which but it didn't matter because then I would have them would make out.

      I'm surprised that recappers and reviewers give the show such low scores (B  is fairly low for the AV Club, especially for such critically regarded comedies) but, and I'll be booed for saying this, I think it might be because people just don't get it. I think it's almost like a 30 minute, live action version of Tom Goes To The Mayor, but with more of a plot structure. So many double crosses and fucked up coincidences and ironic shit goes down, the gang does something that would ultimately ruin them, but the next episode everything is (fairly) fine.

      Gotta disagree with you on the  <em>B is fairly low for the AV Club</em>  part. <br/> 
 <br/> 
it is extremely rare for anything to get a  <em>B</em>  on the AV Club.  And almost unheard of to get an  <em>A</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have never watched the show, and have no plans to do so, so I am not commenting on that.  Just the rarity of any kind of extreme in AV Club ratings.

      I see Sunny as more of a natural extrapolation of Seinfeld.  The last episode of Seinfeld was much maligned, but having revisted the show chronologically and taken the seasons  <em>en masse</em> , those assholes deserved everything they got.  The show is hilarious, but after a while you are like "Show some redeeming quality!  Just a little!  Once!  George is a fucking sociopath for chrissakes!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
In Sunny, the comedy is predicated entirely on what horrible,  <em>horrible</em>  people the gang are, much like Seinfeld.  The plotting in Sunny is much weaker, but the comedy is the same kind of laugh out loud, fast paced, holy shit, what the fuck is going on hilarity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When Mack and Charlie fake their own death, and Mack ends up in a wedding dress, tossing a grenade into Dee's car after crashing it into a wall?  PRICELESS.

      Most people have a little more compassion than the people on Seinfied.  Most people are less neurotic too.  But there is truth in it.  Seinfeld is a social satire, basically, pointing out how illogical many of our social norms are. <br/> 
 <br/> 
George, however, is not a sociopath, by any means.  He's just a neurotic douche.

      He seems like an entirely normal, slightly neurotic person to me. They all do. It was largely based on social situations and a comedy of manners. It often debated and classified unspoken cultural norms and conventions which were generally agreed upon by the audience. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think you overstate the degree of satire. I don't think it necessarily pointed out how social norms were illogical so much as it derived humor from how reasonable and accepted they were. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If anything I think "The Bizzaro Jerry" did a better job of what the finale tried to do. It also showed how unreal and sickeningly cloying that would be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even in the trial most of the evidence that they were bad people was taken out of context. Jerry didn't try to drive Babu out of business and have him deported, he was trying to be genuinely helpful the entire time. The real problems (a bad location most likely and a simple mistake by the mailman) were ignored and typical. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In all fairness Elaine was kind of a dick to the Soup Nazi. I mean, he was strict, but that's not that big of a deal and she over-reacted. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also failed to see that either other people have more compassion or that there was a fundamental lack of compassion on Seinfeld. It was perfectly on the mark for the average person. When Jerry dated the astoundingly nice woman in "The Sponge" it stood out that she was over-the-top not only for the cast, but also compared to just about anyone else.

      I definitely agree that Always Sunny is a coked up version of Seinfeld, considering that that is how they pitched the show originally. I was young when Seinfeld was in its stride, and only really remember the series finale, but I would say that, while the cast weren't TERRIBLE people, their decisions ultimately led them to the fate they met in the finale. If they had just been a little nicer to people they might have gotten away.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would say that Sunny is almost a bizarro-version of Seinfeld. Whereas Seinfeld seemed like utterly ridiculous situations handled by normal people, Sunny is basically normal situations being fucked up by utterly horrible people. The only person with vaguely any decency on that show is Charlie, and his addictions and hang-ups, and ultimately the fact that The Gang is holding back his true potential, as evidenced by The Nightman Cometh, is preventing that from coming through.

      That show was called "MY ANUS IS BLEEDING!!!" while it had a fairly generic and typical premise for a bland, dull sitcom that would amuse nobody and thus guarantee it would remain on the air for over a decade (see also: "Everyone Loves Raymond", "Two and Half Men", well... almost all sitcoms) it was actually interesting, clever, and inventive so it was canceled after less than a full season and replaced with re-runs of the other generic, bland sitcoms.

      Charlie is also a creepy stalker. That's a further reason why The Nightman Cometh didn't work. The Waitress is, amusingly, his real-life wife. <br/>

Only late Seinfeld was about ridiculous situations. The early episodes were often about regular situation and normal social interaction. Actually, that was the majority of the series.

      I think that (oh god this is going to start another fight) Charlie's stalking of The Waitress is mildmannered and sweet. It is obvious that he truly loves her and would never really hurt her, which makes the fact that every other male in The Gang has fucked her all the more painful. <br/>

And yes, the fact that they are married IRL makes most of their altercations funny. Also, his name is Charlie in real life as well.

      Well, just by watching the credits it's obvious that they all basically just used their real names. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Charlie does go too far for it to be sweet though. I suggest you rewatch the parts where it details his diary of everything she does. Or the one where he tries to conspire to make her sleep with him (specifically, not all the other ones). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think we need to have an episode where Dee sleeps with her. It would be rife with comedic possibility and really stick it to Charlie even more. "Who Pooped The Bed?" had the chance to go there, but it didn't.

      i recently wrote a to-do list for myself, and i've been keeping it on my night table. a few days ago i woke up and saw that i'd added to it in my sleep. i have no recollection of when, how or why i wrote this, but nonetheless i had scrawled "doing whippets while driving a tractor-trailer" underneath "call gynecologist" and "make restaurant reservations".

      Man I just Google image searched for "happy darkie" and "Magical Negro" and the first two came up. <br/>

And once before I posted a different image of Geordi LaForge with the "Can't see shit captain" picture that I just kind of stumbled on that time, so I searched for it before and decided on this one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then I was trying to decide which of Will Smith's movies had him being the happy darkiest, but I couldn't pick one, so I just went with Jar Jar.

      Similarly I watched a friend throw a fistful of something in a bonfire. It seemed that it dawned on the drunken fool as it was mid-air. I ran back and hit the ground. I saw a rocket of flame charge at my friends mid-conversation, watched them split apart, the rocket shoot between and the lady of the two scream. Friendly fire man, it's the worst.

      I'd say it's balanced here by Ray's desire to give her some straight up chubbying just as soon as Cornelius dies (which he imagines will be very soon). <br/> 
 <br/> 
She thinks he is classless and low and he is classlessly fantasizing about her, likely because he is unable to stop imagining her as a stripper. <br/>

      i don't think this was Onstad's intention at all. the way i read it, Polly is supposed to be a God-send for Cornelius because not only is she stripper-hot, she also shares his sentiments on everything, including Ray. note how Cornelius takes the first jab? i mean, if anything, Polly's making claims in order to please Cornelius, like in order to fit in with him and "the guys". the problem with that is the dudes can rip on each other because they are doggs and have been since small times. she has been in the door five minutes and would not even be around if Ray's "classlessness" hasn't brought Connie to her in the first place. Connie has gotten arrogant and forgotten about the man who made this all possible. that Man is Ray.

      All good points, but I keep getting the feeling that Ray asked for this.  He's puttin' on airs, and Connie sees right through it...and here as in most things, the food is what makes me think that. <br/>

People who sous vide at home are the kind of people who brag about home appliances they  <em>had</em>  to have after reading this month's Gourmet.  My doggs are comin' over - and this includes their significant others, since I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that they actually like my dogg, even if we haven't met - and I'm responsible for the feed?  I'm cooking something I cook for people that I like.  Sausage and chicken gumbo.  Shrimp Creole.  A good, honest carbonara or a green curry or a huge-ass pot of mussels, since they're cheap as all hell round these parts.  Chicken fried steak.  Throw in good bread, real butter, a cooler of beer, a bottle of solid red and a stack of wet-naps, serve it up family style, and tell everyone that if they want seconds, they know where the pot is.  You treat them like family, and I don't know too many families that stick prime rib in a cryovac.  Keller can kick your ass blindfolded at that game, so leave it to the pros, Ray.  Otherwise your guests get some idea of who you wish you were and how far you gotta go to get there.

      As an amateur "foodie" myself (I disagree with Roast Beef on this one - "foodie" is a perfectly good descriptor, since it implies a sort of whimsy and refusal to take oneself seriously), I totally agree with you. The experimental shit is strictly for other like-minded individuals; when friends come over, keep it simple, keep it hearty, keep it unlikely-to-slaughter-the-ill-adjusted-immune-systems-of-the-guests. <br/>

Ain't nobody going to think that sea urchin gelee with sweetbread puree is anything other than a vain attempt to try and emulate that wacky chef that runs the restaurant where Tony Bourdain hosted his talk show.

      I don't really think she's a jerk...I think she sees Ray for who he is (because, if we're honest, Ray can be kind of ridiculous), and is not judging him but merely stating the facts.  And I don't know that Cornelius has changed--did you ever read some of his blog entries about Ray?  He's a guy that genuinely likes Ray (or why else would he be around him), but also sees him for who he is.  While it IS slightly rude to lampoon your host when he leaves the room, at the same time I feel they're the type of people to treat him with kindness no matter what. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In short...I kinda like the new character, and think she and Cornelius are cute.

      I see what you're saying, but I think my problem is this: <br/> 
 <br/> 
When it's Connie vs. the boys, the crass vastly outweighs the class, making the classy seem, well, classy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now that there's two of them the contrast is sort of lost and it becomes a bit bougie (bourgie?), which is something Cornelius has never felt before, at least to me.

      I also see what you are saying...but at the same time it's nice for Cornelius to have someone to be classy with.  Teodor and Molly were probably the two characters that most may have had the class to hang with him, but Teodor has his moments of crassness and is often preoccupied with Phillippe, and I think at her base level Molly is just a regular gal.  Beyond those two--it's Pat (dick), Phillippe (five), Todd (disgusting little man), Ray (ridiculous), Nice Pete (sociopathic), Lyle (passed out), RB (depressed/and or thinks himself too low to hang out with Connie), and the Robots.  So Polly brings something to the table for Cornelius the other characters, for the most part, don't.

      Ray - ridiculous. Exactly. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ray is like a friend who is the butt of all jokes in his circle. He has the uncanny ability to say exactly the right thing to spark a tirade of hilarious abuse from his friends. But should someone new, someone not in the sanctum, make any similar observation, the defenses are up! How dare they! How dare Polly! <br/> <br/> <br/>

      She has only seen the ridiculous side of Ray. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In general, he can be a dick, and it takes some getting-to-know-him to get past that.  And here he is trying to be cordial and friendly to a  <em>hot stripper</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
She is totally seeing him at his worst.  If she heard the Philippe and the couch story, or the Philippe and Nolan story, or the various other times Ray has been somewhat noble and helpful to those around him, she would soften her view of him. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But if all I knew about Ray were all she knows about Ray, my opinion of him would be rather low.

      That would explain my predilection for cramming both drumsticks forcefully into the body cavity again and again until I crack the ribs and then dousing the entire thing in magic gravy. <br/>

      Well the first paragraph is totally unrelated to the second. Gravy, however, makes almost everything better. It goes on the turkey, the stuffing, and the potatoes. It is great. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Green beans are an abomination in all possible forms. Yams are not good either. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thanksgiving consists of: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Turkey <br/> 
Stuffing <br/> 
Mashed potatoes <br/> 
Gravy <br/> 
Cranberry sauce (freshly made) <br/> 
Pumpkin pie <br/> 
Whipped cream (freshly made... Cool Whip is likewise an abomination and canned whipped cream is best used for sex and nothing else) <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is all. <br/>

Oh and when I cram in the drumsticks? I like it with the giblets  <em>in</em> .

      Dude, green beans are awesome when prepared correctly.  It's just more common for them to suck because most people will boil them until they're soggy. <br/> <br/> <br/> I can get on board with yams though, and maybe some of the root vegetables (parsnip?).

      Dude it was always like that, even before Cartoon Network. You ever sit down and watch  <em>Tiny Toon Adventures</em>  or  <em>Animaniacs</em> ?

      Nah. That happened in the past too. Look at Animaniacs. For that matter, look at the old Warner Brothers cartoons. They often had hell of references to pop culture of the day. Not quite as many as now, but it was still a valid source of reference.

      I'm sorry, I like throwing parties where  <strong><em>everyone</em></strong>  has fun.  Part of the fun is trusting in the taste of the person throwing the 'dig, and possibly hearing something you haven't heard before.  For instance, "Dr. Bootygrabber" by a group called the Detroit Grand Pubahs.  I think I laughed all the way through that song the first time I heard it.  Or Wesley Willis.  Or a thousand and one other songs and artists that you would never stumble across if you were picking out the music yourself.  And socializing with people.  And other reasons why you go to a party. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What you're describing (and what I've read in an article describing the same thing, except on a NY subway train rolling party) is nothing more than group masturbation  <em>en solo</em> .  We have too much disconnect in modern life: why the hell would we want even more of it when we're around others? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Last question: is there something going on with the folks roughly only a decade younger than myself that revel in this sort of detachment? <br/>

      group masturbation on a subway? <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's been going on in  <em>every</em>  generation! <br/>

Seriously though I think it'd be sort of fun, not saying I'd throw one or hang out there for a long time, but I just like to do Stuff. <br/>

Once I went to a ritual pig slaughter (for Freya) at some farm with my friend and her dad.  I got pig blood smeared on my forehead with a pinecone, and we all had to renounce monotheism to be allowed in the slaughter area.  I watched two hillbillies try and stick sharpened skivs into a pig's throat for half-an-hour, then we all played drums and some guy told us he killed a bear with a bow and arrow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That was a fun party.  I think sensibillism would be okay too.

      Neo is hardly a word I'd use to describe these people.  They were honest to goodness, salt-of-the-Earth, blood-dousing, Nordic God worshiping, overall-wearing, bow-and-arrow hunting Pagans.  It was an experience I share with only a few, and that is exactly the sort of thing I like to do. :0)

      I don't really like Polly, she seems a bit superfluous. but maybe Onstad is making a point here. He seems to come in for a lot of criticism for being unable to write decent female characters, so he's come up with a woman who is not only as intellectual and verbose as Connie, but is also a stripper, who are usually thought of as being pretty dumb.

      The first time I used a dvd player was to watch Moulin Rouge, and found it awesomely avant-garde because of the voice-over work. I found out with the closing credits that I had fumbled with the soundtrack options and that I had watched the version for the visually impaired.  <br/> 
I don't usually talk about this.  <br/> 
I like to think that Cornelius does the Spice for the blind thing. I like it because it's a little funny, and because I feel embarrassed a little. Sort of like that scene in the Kubrick movie where Nicole Kidman is stoned and goes to the bathroom.  <br/> 
That answers 3.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
2: Because Cornelius is all kinds of badass, including that kind of badass.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
1: Supper parties include cocktails that are the drinks you start with so you can chill out and wait for the fashionably still-trying-to-figure-out-what-pair-of-chucks-to-wear-s. Connie being aware that Polly may, and should, be the center of attention, as a newcomer with an occupation that will have host and guests assume mucho, he is careful not to put her in the awkward position of the last guest to arrive - so that she has time to gradually figure things out, rather than be labeled shallow when assumed to have taken ages picking the right scarf. Doubtless Molly understands that well, plus she doesn't want Beef hammered on Tequilatinis before the cheese salad hits the plates. That's what I think, because I was wondering too, and I almost asked, and then I thought of that and I waited for someone to ask it so they would look silly instead.  <br/> 
Now you look silly!

      That really depends how you play it.  I've sampled the spectrum, and there are plenty of ways to be female without attracting obnoxious attention.  The simplest is to use a Christian Bale avatar, clearly indicating to all guys that they are beneath your standards and might as well make normal conversation because the sexy talk just won't work. <br/>

Being generally oblivious to anything you don't like to hear helps.  Eventually they'll stop saying it if it never gets a response.

      Only when it's convenient.  Normally I'm just a human without a particular interest in gender. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rape fantasies?  Maybe a little, but I'd prefer to try consentual sex first.  I can kinda imagine the appeal in surrendering power to someone else, but I'd like to get an idea of what's a normal sexual encounter before then.  There's gotta be something not mentioned in sex ed class, or people wouldn't be so excited about it.

      I have never had a girl be interested quickly enough that lack of lubrication was a problem. I find that a degree of lengthy pre-heating is often necessary. Using lube to just microwave things? Sadly, not part of my experiences. I do not get quickies. This is sad.

      Are you getting what autrepoupee is telling you? This is important. You can be "just a human" with no gender interest, fine. However... <br/> 
 There's a thing called personal autonomy, not to be confused with Myspace. Most people have it, and it is viewed as a "healthy" offshoot thingy of ego, if you will. It automatically establishes and adjusts boundaries. Very handy. <br/> 
 If you don't have this, or have a diminished sense of it, you probably have a problem in the societal sense.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your thing about rapists got needs too, that's way off. It's like, did Bill Hicks go there?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Surrendering power is different to the surrender of love. Rape is almost political- it's about dominance and power; that's not love, it's not normal human relationship. You may see plenty of variations on it, that doesn't mean it's normal or desirable. It isn't.  <br/>

Still kind of a funny status.

      Last week I was telling my 9 year old about how they name big bottles of wine after old Biblical kings (I could only remember Nebuchadnezzar to be honest) and he was mildly impressed by my grasp of useless wine trivia.  Then we are given the  <em>Jeroboam</em>  of cologne and I had to call the boy over.  Again, mildly impressed: " <em>huh</em> , that's interesting" he says...   Is it too soon for him to start acting like a teenager?  Am I going to be one of "those" dads?... <br/> 
 <br/> 
yes.  hell yes.  I'm making it a personal goal to wear black dress socks with tennis shoes and shorts while driving him around town.  HELLS yeah.

      Then you will never have moments like this: your dear old-fashioned Aunt and Uncle from the Coast are visiting. Uncle is a registered Chess Master, who calmly administers objective whippings that increase your skill exponentially.  <br/> 
 He magnanimously lets the 8-year old stepson play, as the boy enjoys the game, and cuts him some slack. <br/> 
 <br/> 
However, you have to draw the line and refuse the 3-year old son from playing, as he has no comprehension of the pieces, much less the game strategy. <br/> 
 Daddy's boy mumbles petulantly, "bastud", and Aunt and Uncle's jaws drop. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 I couldn't punish him, he heard it from me pounding nails, besides which he had a right to his opinion.  <br/> 
 My childless-by-choice sister was there, and still rips a belly laugh guffaw recalling that.  <br/>
