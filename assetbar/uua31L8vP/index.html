      Well, if you're already sitting around watching Magical Sex Blokes with the dudes, I don't see how running off to do something about it would be that awkward. In fact, if nobody gets up to do anything about it, I'd think you'd run the risk of it turing into a very different kind of party. A Party of Discovery!

      I was hanging out with a mixed group of friends once and had to run off to pick someone else up and when I got back everyone was just sitting around watching porn. While not unusual given the group it was a tad awkward. After a bit of silence I made some comment about the film and I got shushed by one of the girls like she was intent on being able to follow the plot and I was interrupting it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Very awkward.

      That's why you have to get ridiculous porn. The only time I've ever watched porn with a group of people, it was the Alice in Wonderland porn, which if you haven't seen it is basically a low-budget 50's Disney movie mixed with a higher than average-budget 80's porno. There's boning, but also enough hilarity that any bits of arousal are momentary and therefore not awkward.

      Most of the CSIs at least make an effort to be a semi-respectable detective show, but CSI: Miami gave up several seasons ago.  The show makes fun of itself so much you can't even MST3K it, you're just sitting there all "I got nothing."  The police department on CSI: Miami has a crime lab so futuristic you couldn't build it with the entire NASA budget, and David Caruso's acting range is so limited that Keanu Reeves has astonishing emotion and depth compared to it.  The show is SO CAMPY it's a delight to watch. <br/>

There's about four dozen drinking games for CSI: Miami, too, but they all end with stage five renal failure.

      That's one of the things I really enjoy about Pat's blogs - they usually start with a grain of reason, something a normal person might actually get irritated about, and  <em>then</em>  go completely off the rails.  It's that much funnier than writing a guy who's just completely irrational.
