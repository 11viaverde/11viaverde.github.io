      I used the stick traps, would have worked well, too, but I awoke to the LOUDEST slapping sound and what should appear in my livingroom but a fucking opossum, walking all sideways, two traps stuck to his right feet. I did what any half asleep paranoid dude would do and shot him with grandma's old cheap pistol. He rolled over and died like they did in westerns. Damn.

      My mom hates these traps now because she's the sort of person who doesn't want to hurt or kill a mouse, but she doesn't want to find bonus chocolate sprinkles in the bread bag, either. She set one of the glue traps, but the mouse had all night to panic and roll around and end up ripping some of its hair and skin off. All sticky, hairy blood on the kitchen floor like an outtake from Saw.

      Snap Traps are probably the worst way to go, since it can leave blood all over, and if you forget about then the blood will fester along with the mouse, etc. Poison runs the risk of them dying in the walls and rotting, or they run out in the open and you get to see a mouse staggering along with blood coming out of it's ears. I use sticky traps, or box traps, as long as you check them regularly you won't be left with a lovely stench. Sticky traps work best at catching them, but at that point the only option you have is putting them in a bag and chucking them in a dumpster, which is kind of cruel. With box traps you can take them out and let them go, but I've noticed certain mice don't like them. I got with sticky traps and dumpster method, because after cleaning mouse shit out of my cupboards with bleach for the third time I don't really have much compassion.

      My brother kind of combined "fake-ass made in a factory" and "barbaric" when we caught a mouse in a plastic wal-mart bag and he took it outside and whanged the bag against the wall until the mouse stopped moving.

      The mouse in my apartment last year dodged skillfully over sticky traps and pulled the bait out of box traps, then turned his nose up at every bait. <br/> 
Four months after the battle commenced, he succumbed to snap trappage, but by that time he'd stopped scratching in the walls at night so we didn't check the trap so diligently, assuming he had just died in the walls. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah. Unpleasantness.

      We once caught a small Australian marsupial in our mouse trap. The native mouse was a fairly large specimen with very cute eyes and he pulled around that trap with his sorry arse at a forty five degree angle to the rest of him. It took two days before he tired out enough for us to find him. You know when a rodent is hiding with his tail in full view that he's close to well and truly fucked.

      I humanely box trapped numerous mice before committing an atrocity last week.  I had left the box trap in my kitchen sink, planning ahead for easy scatalogical clean-up, the night before.  I then slept in till noon and was happy to see another furry little squatter in the cage.  Thought it was odd that he was sitting on top of the Dangling Nasty Fish Cake I was using as bait, but whatever... <br/> 
  I wish now I had thrown his ass across the street into the neighbor's yard, as per usual, but instead I staggered back inside and messed around on the internet for an hour.  When I came back outside, around 2pm, he was dead.  I thought, "What?  How did he starve so quickly?  There's still plenty of D.N.F.C. left!"  Then I noticed his pathetic little tongue hanging out of his mouth and it struck me; I had straight broiled his ass to death.  It was 2pm and my sink just reflected all that death energy all up in there and cooked him.   <br/> 
  He was still standing up.  One little paw hooked into the ceiling.  How many humans have ever fought so hard for life that they died standing up?  This was the Braveheart of mice, man.   <br/> 
  The worst thing was seeing that tiny little tongue hanging out just like a dehydrated human's would.  His tongue is like, a thousand times smaller than mine.  If you removed the tongues of a thousand mice and then removed mine, I think they would be about the same size.  And all this happened while I was inside READING THIS VERY WEBCOMIC!! <br/> 
  Man's inhumanity to mice...

They left the microwave in their garage for about a month, until we came to visit.  A faint knocking sound... whatever could it be?  Maggots.  Maggots trapped in the walls of the microwave, seemingly with no food, surviving on our horrified screams.  We just threw the damn thing out.

      True story: my roommate caught a mouse in one of those humane box traps, and then he was gonna let it out in an alley on his way to work.  But then the box fell off his dashboard and the mouse escaped into his trash-filled car, and he had to go to work so he couldn't try to root it out or anything.  He left the trap in the car, though, and when he got off work there was the mouse in the trap again.  What an idiot.  The mouse, I mean.
