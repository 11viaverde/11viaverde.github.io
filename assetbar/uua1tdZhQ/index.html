      Having worked in a supermarket I wholeheartedly disagree. Between people who love to leave several pounds of chicken hidden in ridiculous places; managers who knock several jars of relish on the floor then sheepishly call for a cleanup; and picking up the little rolls of toilet paper in the women's room desperately hoping none of them contain used, bloody feminine hygiene products, sort of like a demented game of Minesweeper (hint - almost all of them do); taking the mushrooms out of the bell peppers is almost a treat.

      It'd be just like pro wrestling -- inflated egos, adopted characters, spectacle everywhere -- only the risk of death is very real.  Actually, it'd be more like a Roman Colosseum battle -- gladi8orrex and glyc are the lions and poor condemned individuals are thrown into the ring where their rationality, their sanity, and their very souls are viciously stripped from them.

      This is untrue.  Bathrooms -- women's bathrooms, in particular -- are just as bad as (if not worse than) any public facility you will ever find anywhere.  At least movie theater patrons have the decency to tuck their feminine hygiene products into TP tubes.  Female McDonald's customers have a habit of just slinging the things straight onto the floor.  Let me say that tufts of cotton fiber dried into a puddle of menstrual blood  are not something you want to have to clean off of a tile floor for minimum wage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In addition, there are parents to deal with.  Parents who are sick as shit of cleaning up after their kids at home, and see McDonald's as "freedom from trying not to make a mess" just as hotel visitors enjoy the "freedom of not having to worry about cleaning semen off of the curtains".  They will allow their teething infants to mangle a Happy Meal hamburger and distribute it as they please, onto the table, the booth seat, and the floor.  If you can imagine putting a hamburger into a zip-lock bag, hocking a few juicy loogies into it, sealing the bag, stomping on it until it no longer resembles food, and then spreading it about as though you were fertilzing a lawn, that would approximate the aftermath. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I worked at McDonald's for two years in high school.  That was all the experience I needed to know that I didn't want to work in any job that involved food or direct interaction with customers ever again.

The reason I don't think it is anybody supporting McCain is because they're reading Achewood, which implies they have a sense of humor.  There are no funny conservatives.

      I love Anne Coulter because there are no sane people who can listen to her and say "wow, she makes some good points underneath all that frothing rage," which only does damage to her party. <br/>

I hate Anne Coulter because she also does damage to the religion she belongs to which I also happen to belong to.  I don't much care to be associated with  <em>that</em> .

      Dave Barry sputters and loses track of himself every time he appears on Real Time, but he's not terribly unfunny.  He's okay,  <em>for a conservative</em> .  Maybe it's a male thing, because a lot of otherwise hilarious dudes I know think Dave Barry is funny. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Drew Carey is a libertarian, no doubt about it.  I suppose I should rephrase my broad statement: There are no funny  <em>social</em>  conservatives. <br/>

      Real Time is Bill Maher's program on HBO.  Comedy, I suppose, is very subjective.  I think Dave Barry's reputation is inflated, and while he may have been the best humorist in America during that era, The Cosby Show was also considered to be the greatest sitcom. <br/>

There are outliers to any hypothesis, and I'll grant you Dave Barry, on the assumption that I just don't get him.

      Recall this was right before the Age of Irony.  The Cosby show was largely pre-ironic, as were the great strips of Dave Barry.  I used to read Dave Barry regularly as a kid.  I thought it was funny at the time.  Then came Seinfeld, and the Simpsons, and nothing has been the same since.  So it's not that the 80s weren't funny, it's just that our collective sense of humor worked differently.

      Naw, it's just that Dave Barry was never the funniest man in America.  The coupling of occassional sardonic wit with the more common annoyingly goofy mugging was just really appreciated back then (see Robin Williams).  I read a lot of my mom's Dave Barry books (she was a big fan) from when I was age 10-16, and thought he was hilarious.  Then I grew up a little, and realized he was occasionally very funny but mostly repetitive and corny.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
He has a habit of prolonging a good idea and running it into the ground, but not even in an interesting self-destructive (or "ironic") way.  I always picture him now as the kind of guy who has some talent there and scratches the surface every once in a while (hey, he likes Achewood, so he's got the idea), but ultimately always thinks "how will this play in Peoria?"

      I used to read Dave Barry's humor column when it ran in the paper I worked at. It was pretty decent. And yea, libertarians don't really count as conservatives for our purposes, since when it comes to humor (or most social interaction for that matter), you're far more likely to be discussing social issues than the specifics of economic policy. They tried to make that conservative version of the Daily Show (I think it was called the 1/2 Hour News Hour) and it was outright painful to watch.

      Is this directed at me?  If so, I think you're taking it a little personally.  I made an admittedly broad statement about conservatives in comedy.  One that I'm willing to concede has it's outliers.  They're not Dennis Miller, Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Mark Levin, Savage Weiner, or Mallard Filmore.  Feel free to point me towards some hilarious and wildly successful conservative humorists, as others have done (Dave Barry, P.J. O' Rourke). <br/> 
 <br/> 
You getting mean-spirited and suggesting I'm ignorant of some 'situation' does little to prove me wrong.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Comedy, like I said, is subjective.  And I agree that some political jokes are hackneyed, "DICK cheney lol" and "Hilary's a dyke WOOOAGGH!" jokes included. <br/>

      Not to be all post-ironic and part of the situation, but our current vice president shot a man in the FACE, and tried to cover it up.  in the FACE.  The problem with most conservative humorists (and I stress most, as there are exceptions to every sweeping generalization, including this one) is that they refuse to acknowledge the depths of absurdity conservative governance has taken us the last decade or so.  in the FACE. <br/>

      Let's be fair here, it was bird shot.  I've seen plenty of people who've be blasted with bird shot.  It's like getting a money shot from a tranny: similar to the real thing, but you can't possible be hurt by it.

      Remember when Ray had his "conjecture" that lesbians were funnier than normal people? It was a funny throwaway line, mostly because the premise is so absurd. This is of similar absurdity. I hate getting into these overwrought Assetbarguments, but I've worked for both the Democratic and Republican parties and I feel the need to clear something up. I've had tons of experience dealing with both liberals and conservatives, and enduring their respective brands of "humor." And, surprise! Neither are "funny" by nature at all.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
As a culture we have a tendency to try and reduce incredibly complex things (like comedy) into a series of meaningless stereotypes. "Old people aren't funny." "Republicans have no sense of humor." "Liberals are funny people." They are rarely true. I don't know many people who are intrinsically funny at all, LEAST of all liberals. Those who think that mentioning that George W. Bush is from Texas or that Dick Cheney shot someone once creates an automatic joke certainly aren't very funny. They're good people, but that sort of humor isn't even interesting. It's lazy tripe, funny only to those who are willing to disengage their cerebral cortex whenever they come across political humor of their stripe.    <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's such a thing as solid political humor, and it exists outside of ideological boundaries. When H.L. Mencken did politics, he couldn't be beat. George Will is wonderful. Colbert has his moments. But this idea that liberals are intrinsically more comedic than conservatives is ridiculous nonsense. Comedy exists outside of ideological, regional, or ethnic boundaries. Trying to classify it as "better" among certain groups is willfully blindsiding yourself to perfectly fine humor in order to attain some impossible purity of ideas. It's inextricably foolish, and for a group of people smart enough to read and appreciate Achewood, I'm not entirely sure why anyone here would tolerate that sort of mind-numbing crap.

 <br/> 
also, I'd rather not argue about what is funny/not funny anymore, and I never really intended to in the first place, although I can see how my initial comment would've created some sort of argument.  It's totally subjective.  Honestly though, you can't tell me there are just as many popular comedians who are also conservative, as there are popular comedians who are liberal.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And that certainly isn't because we're a liberal nation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To be honest, I thought the whole "conservative comedy is not funny" was old hat.  The 1/2 Hour Comedy Show, John Gibson's insistence that a white guy using hip-hop jargon is all it takes to win a Peabody, and John McCain's qt quip about Chelsea Clinton's ugliness was proof enough.

      This is a point I should've made earlier anyway, but I thought it would just be understood: I refer only to professionals.  I'm sure there are a few funny people walking around on this Earth who have conservative leanings, I don't doubt that. <br/>

On the professional level though, pickings, they be slim.

      Don't think I don't understand, and in fact, agree with your argument (if not the tone), but, easy or not, the fact that our vice-president shot someone in the face is goddamn hilarious, apart from political ideology.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was lazy in my argument, yes, but as far as humor in the public forum, I think one would be hard pressed to find a consistent  <em>public</em>  voice on the conservative end of the spectrum that is more than an exception proving the rule.  One of my oldest, closest friends is a dyed-in-the-wool Goldwater Republican and constantly makes cracks at the my ideology that I can and do appreciate and laugh at.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>But</em>  he doesn't have a talk show because the mediapolis doesn't have an outlet for conservative wit.  Liberals, while obviously having a liberal bias, often do an excellent job of lampooning themselves, thus leaving no space for a conservative to make his mark.  The ones who get to the public forum get there because they cater to the kneejerk far right idiocy that you describe in your post, since that isn't fulfilled by the "mainstream". <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would love to go on, but this is the stupidest, stupidest possible place to have this discussion.  <br/>

On the real, I ought to just end my part of this like such:  In the interest of full disclosure, I'm an absolute bleeding-heart, violin-playing liberal.  So, my taste in humor must run along those lines.  Weak humor is weak humor, wherever it may come from.

      My thought, as an economics major, is that it's mostly a market effect. Liberals tend to watch/buy more comedy than conservatives, and as thus, the material (and those who succeed) in the field tends to be skewed towards the buying demographic. Conservative humorists have trouble cashing in because conservatives tend to eschew making a concerted effort to partake in humor they have to buy. Nature of their preferred brand, really. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I agree, however. This is really a horrible place to have an argument. I didn't really intend to argue further. I just thought that leaving my point unsaid would have been rather silly if the argument were to flare up again with others at the helm. Also, full disclosure. Politically, I'm hard right on essentially all economic issues and a classical liberal on social issues and foreign policy. Merry Christmas.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also: I volunteered (and got paid once or twice, for some odd reason) for the Kerry campaign when I was 14 and worked/volunteered for the Republican party for a very short stint this year. Granted, that ended when McCain got the nomination, but oh well. <br/>

      This is the case at times, yes. I'm just tired of this idea that the middle part of the US, especially the south, is full of nothing but hateful racist idiots. There are people like that here, sure, but not nearly as many as a lot of people seem to think. And there are people like that on the coasts, too. And (*gasp*) in  <em>other countries</em>  as well! <br/>

      Well, hbaranov is British, so the whole coastal elitism thing doesn't even apply here. But I mean it's a statistical fact that the Bible Belt states have poorer education systems, lower high school graduation/college enrollment rates, higher teen pregnancy rates, and let's not forget that they elected Bush twice. The caveats are a) the South and the Midwest are not the same thing, b) it's more of a rural/urban divide than a regional thing, and the coasts just have a higher concentration of cities, and c) none of this applies to anyone here anyway. I'm saying this all rather disinterestedly. I never really understood the concept of regional pride, since you're all citizens of the same country and can just pick up and move wherever the hell you want, but then again, I wasn't even born here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will say, however, that I appreciate the fact that you can spend most of your life in New York without ever encountering the kinds of people you described. Sure, you get other annoyances like hipsters instead, but relatively speaking it seems like an easy choice, unless you kind of enjoy being an iconoclast among people you can feel superior to. I guess outside of the coasts it's also easier to connect with people who have common interests since there's relatively few of you and you're surrounded by a more hostile culture (like in SLC Punk), whereas here you just get lost in a sea of others who are more or less similar. So whatever. To each his own.

      It's not really a "regional pride" thing; I'm not incredibly pro-south or anything. But at the same time, I don't really appreciate that people think my home is full of dumbasses when it really isn't.

I'm not necessarily proud of the Midwest, but I'm not ashamed either.  The assumption that all people who live here are plebes, fools, and eye rubbing, mouth-breathing white trash is enough to drive you into the arms of regional pride, though. <br/>

      There's really no way to argue this except from personal experience. I guess it just depends on the kind of circles you associate with, and you're probably not likely to meet someone who embodies ALL the stereotypes anywhere. Sure, there are ignorant people everywhere, but there are different types of ignorance. All I know is that I've never encountered anyone here who didn't believe in evolution or thought that atheists and gays were gonna burn in hell, but these people do exist somewhere. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On the other hand, I know someone who grew up in Tennessee, and she had to put up with a lot of shit because she was Asian, whether it was outright racism, like people yelling "me love you long time" out of car windows, or more subtle ignorance like someone asking her "so where do Buddhists go to church on Sundays?" on no other basis than her appearance. Not to mention she and the few other Asian kids in the school had to pretend to be Christian in order to fit in. And this isn't someone who's particularly PC or inclined to pick up on offensive things either. None of my Asian friends who grew up here have experienced anything even slightly similar (not least because there are many more of them - about 40% in my high school). I can't really speak as to the experience of black people or other minorities in the South, but I can hardly imagine it being better. So all I'm saying is that my general impression is that the overall cultural vibe is somewhat less progressive, which is borne out by things like voting patterns and polls on whether people are 'comfortable' with a black president or interracial marriage.

      All right now. I grew up UU in Texas, and I got a lot of shit for it (being called "heathen," being told I didn't have the "morals" to be on 8th grade student council, etc etc etc). I don't particularly want to get involved in this discussion right now, but I do want to address one sentence you wrote: "she and the few other Asian kids in the school had to pretend to be Christian in order to fit in." I can't even put into words how wrong and sad that is. That was a choice that she personally made to fit in, not one that was made for her by "ignorant southern culture." If you're going to pretend to be a religion you're not just so assholes will like you, then you obviously didn't feel too strongly about your original religion in the first place.

      I'm not saying they don't exist here, I'm just saying it's possible to go about your life without ever coming into contact with them, as I and many others have. I remember there was an NYT article right after the 2004 election where they were talking about the massive disconnect New Yorkers felt from the rest of America and a lot of the people they interviewed said they didn't even  <em>know</em>  anyone who voted for Bush. I think the actual breakdown for the city was something like 90% Democratic, and I'd be willing to wager that most of the other 10% were Wall Street types who just didn't care much about the social issues. I just don't think it's such a big deal to admit statistical facts - it's not like it reflects poorly on you personally.

      Oh, I know very well that statistics about the south or my state don't reflect on me personally.  In fact--I, too, didn't know anyone among my friends and acquaintances who voted for Bush in 2004.  This was in Texas.  Where I've lived for most of my life.  I also do not do the "regional pride" thing.  Neither do most of the people with whom I associate.  Nor do I know how to ride a horse, or raise cattle, or cook chili, or stun rattlesnakes just by looking at them and saying "Tommy Lee Jones" three times then spitting chaw out the right side of my mouth. <br/>

      I'm completely with you on the whole "regional pride" thing, Ethel. I've lived here thirteen years and am regularly told by my Austin-born friend that I'm "not allowed to be Texan." Because I'm from Louisiana, originally. When I first moved here at the age of 10 the amount of pride in Texas stunned me. I've never lived in a place where they said the state pledge after the national pledge.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's a funny thing, you know. As Americans we have two great ideals: there's individual rights and the concept that it's not what you are or where you're from that makes you, but what you choose yourself - and the concept of home, of region, of keeping to your own. It's good to have a people, to try and live up to this vague ideal that comes from being Texan and American, or black or Latino, to keep to a heritage. Even if that heritage derives its legitimacy from the simple creed of "that's how it's been done since forever, and 100 years of people can't be all wrong" or the arbitrary introduction of melanin into the skin. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I decided a long time ago that I wasn't going to live up to being Texan, or Southern, or White or Irish. No, Texas and America and everyone else is going to have to live up to  <em>me</em> . I'll strive for excellency on my own terms, and make my own moral decisions, and if I do it well enough then eventually they'll scramble to claim me as their own, and hopefully I'll leave something good in my wake.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or not. I suppose time will tell.

      "not allowed to be Texan".. I used to hear that a lot.. but I lived in a rural area of Texas. Even by Texas standards. I grew up and had most of my education from the state of FL so I was really suprised when I found out I had *just* missed going to a "Texas History" class. There were a lot of great people in Texas but there were a lot more of them who were pretty much walking talking stereotypes of the people I imagined in Texas. <br/>

If you look at the facts, the states really are not that much different per capita.  The best generalization you could make about the US is that we are all more or less homogeneous in such things as racism, education, intelligence, economy, etc.

      I'll go ahead and clarify my post above about statistics and facts.  I'm pretty close to a professional statistician, and it's a clear matter of correlation and causation.  Stats correlate data, facts are a sign of causation.  Saying an area of the country is dumber than another is meaningless.  Saying it trends that way is neat, like saying women tend to be dumber because historically (over the history of civilization) women have received less education.  It isn't causative, it doesn't 'mean' anything concrete.  Calling a region 'flyover' is a pretty strong statement about your views on the region, and if all you can state is correlation regarding that area, you really have a weak basis for your statement.

      Sure, there are differences, but what I'm saying is that there really isn't that much difference between 60 teen births per thousand and 20 or 40 per thousand.  Montana is ranked 9th in education, while Calfiornia is ranked 46th - not exactly what you would expect from the way people talk/think about average  Montanans and Californians...  So, yeah it's overstating things to say we are more or less homogeneous, but regional differences are certainly not anywhere near as large as people think (besides culture).  Red states think the blue states are crime infested, drug addled, and have an explosion of teen pregnancies, welfare, etc.  Blue states think the red ones are all poor, ignorant, racist dumbfucks.  Really, they are more or less the same. <br/>

      No, I meant that here 'headbanging' is something specifically associated with metal and not just the general act of banging your head against something. I'm not sure if you guys have that term because while we usually refer to metal fans as headbangers, I think you just call them metallers.

      Would this mean that there was no Headbangers Ball in the UK? That is too much cultural deprivation. Too much. <br/>

But I think I usually call them metalheads, not headbangers Is this an East Coast/West Coast thing?

      Speaking as a UK citizen and sometime headbanger, I can confirm that headbanging is a term associated here with rock/metal and not the act of banging one's head against something, which we call "banging one's head against something"

      So it's the laugh track that's never played during Big Bang Theory? <br/>

Have you ever heard the laugh track in Two And a Half Men? They play it on the highest level possible during some of the worst, non-humor points in the show. <br/>

      I laugh.  Buddy of mine's approaching terminal velocity along his trajectory toward tying the knot, and we find that the whole wedding story arc here is particularly apt (me and another dude, who are both in the wedding party, have threatened to wear fezes to the event, for instance; I have offered to lead the smoke break, being about the only person left in the gang who hasn't quit; despite my pleas, I have not been awarded the title of Worst Man).  Anyhow, my buddy's brother is the best man, and has dropped the ball on planning the bachelor party... not quite Showbiz level hijinks, but I feel sure there is a spiritual link.

      To Milkpants: <br/> 
 <br/> 
I saw what you did.  You went back in time to lame me in the past, in a vain attempt to destroy me in the present.  However, if you look at yesterday's comments, you will see that I already shot you at some point in the continuum, rendering your efforts futile.  Whatever the permutations and hilarious misunderstanding which may occur on this adventure through time, know this:  I emerge victorious at the end of the path, regardless of its twists and turns along the way.

      i liked it a lot, but i'm a sad sappy sucker though.  and it's set in my town and in the book they go to places that i go, so it gets bonus points. <br/> 
 <br/> 
but really it's an awesome book, and i've recommended it to friends and they've enjoyed it.  common questions are:  <br/> 
Q) is it science fictiony?   <br/> 
A) not really at all, no.  besides the time travel, but it doesn't feel like sci-fi at all. <br/> 
Q) is something that only girls who love The Notebook will like? <br/> 
A) no.  it's a love story, but the good kind.  not that predictable romantic comedy stuff.

The author needs to work on voicing a lot...I sometimes couldn't distinguish between the two main characters' voices, and the attempt to convey non-standard dialects wasn't terribly well conveyed.  Also I could see the ending coming from a mile away, but time travel and surprise don't work together real well anyway.

      Having now read it, I would agree totally with the characterization of all the non-white characters.  The attempt to show dialects failed horribly and just seemed like a reinforcement of stereotypes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It was entertaining, not brilliant.  And I didn't cry at the ending.

      It is only because he is playing a role that he is able to inhabit a "sane"...er..."not irritating"...er..."consise" voice.  If you go back and check, there are many intertwinings and insta-responses between both glyc and gladi8.  Plus, as glyc has become more and more reviled, thus Gladi8 has posted more often to compensate.  I hope I am wrong because I love Gladi8orrex, and do not wish to see him become an  <em>actual</em>  troll as opposed to a brilliant parody.  [o]<----tie fighter

      I don't think so. I mean remember initially glyc was trying to pass off as someone else, but he wrote exactly like alreadyinuse. The whole thing with glyc/alreadyinuse is that he basically cannot filter his train of thought. He wouldn't have the discipline to pull off a character like gladi8orrex.

      Well.. not that there's any way for you to infer this based on my asset bar insanity, but FYI I can certainly muster discipline when I want to.  If I can muster non-annoying creativity is something else which remains to be seen. <br/> 
 <br/> 
No, I am not gladi8orrex.  I do like the endearing fellow quite a lot, so I would hate for anyone to attribute to him any feelings of annoyance which originiated with myself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah I like my ramblings and such, and I have even at times claimed that they are genius, but obviously, they are inferrior to those of gladi8orrex and also Dr. Manflesh, if only because my ramblings are so much more inaccessible than their.s   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Gladi8orrex is an actual personage, a character, an interactive fellow, really, that that is what is so much fun about him, or for those who are annoyed by him, what makes him, I would think, more annoying, as opposed to Dr. Manflesh or myself who just kind of scream our wacko rants like someone who's grabbed supervision of a half-duplex channel and won't let go. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I say that whoever gladi8orrex is, must be some kind of writer who is practicing character development. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I rule you out achilleselbow, as the potential gladi8orrex, because you just don't seem to ever exhibit that kind of sillyness in your posts.  You have more of a subtle and dry humor and wit and sillyness...   <br/> 
It could be that gladi8orrex is actually none of us...   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean no offense, but seriusly guys, this isn't exactly the most stimulating conversation in the world that we have on here.  Sometimes it's very stimulating but mostly not.  Someone with the self discipline to maintain the character of gladi8orrex for weeks on end might just have the self discipline to not get sucked into this quasi-tv show that is asset bar.  We are essentially a collective TV show, each of us making up a small part of the feed, but for the most part, this is a one-to-many feed, just like a tv show. <br/> 
 <br/> 
maybe gladi8orrex works in some sort of group home for developmentally challenged cats, and as such has some awesome models on which to base his character. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't follow this board to closely and I'm not too socially smart anyway when it comes to reading people, so maybe there are others, but I myself only know of one person here who has demonstrated the requisit self discipline and the penchant for loony character development, and that is onstad himself. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do submit to y'all that I now have the coolest username on assetbar, bar none!  I'm so proud of it.

      I'll leave y'all to take from these definitions as you will. I submit that _ / alreadyinuse12&3 / glyc have become the living embodiment of the characters that people and Onstad himself attempts to parody (like gladi8's characters but with a number of obvious differences). Lame him, ignore him, but know he really is the voice that is played softly underneath other action such as characters talking.

      Internet reference.  Again.  Basically, when someone starts in on hot talking, you say "Ohhh, I love roleplaying".

The difference between the two is that you made an indirect reference to sodomizing minors in general, while pogo was making direct references to a specific minor that we all know and love.  The former can be funny in certain situations, while the latter is just plain creepy regardless of context.

      Believe me, thorfinn, I take your concerns seriously, and applaud you for defending minors.  However, may I point out that 18 is supposed to be the age of all who enter here, and there would be no way to determine if anyone really is 18, really is male or female, or anything like that.  So I assume we're all grownups unless someone specifically claims to be younger.  To my knowledge, catgirl131 has not made any age claims, and dishes out as good as she gets, so hurrah for that.  This is meeting of the minds here, completely divorced from any thought of meeting up or physical contact (I know, we've had one or two hookups, but that's their problem), and as far as I can tell, no one is holding back on either the filth, salaciousness, or irreverence of their posts.  But I should be held to a higher standard, perhaps, being the father of a child older than most of you.  So it shall be.  No more hitting on females.  *Sigh*  It was SOOOOO CREEEEEPY!

      And people drink it? *confused* I guess my palate has matured. I remember back in the day a concotion called (if memory serves)  <em>Nikov</em>  a "Vodka and Orange flavoured wine" sold in a 4 litre plastic bladder. 14% alcohol and the price of a six-pack. Extremely cheap and decidedly not cheerful this was the choice of 16 year olds everywhere. The unofficial slogan of  <em>Nikov</em>  was "There always some left for the morning".

      To me almost any beer with something fruity or sweet mixed in tastes better than regular beer. I just never understood how people come to enjoy drinking stuff that's bitter and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth, no matter how subtle the interplay of hops and grains or whatever. I mean didn't everyone hate beer when they first tried it at age 12 or so? So what changed? I mean you still drink soda when you're older, and if they made a non-alcoholic drink that tasted like beer I doubt it would be very popular, so I just don't really get it. I guess I'll stick to cider or lambic beer when I can get it. Or, you know, coconut mojitos are always good. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not everything sweet is good though. From what I remember that strong fruit-flavored "wine" that you're talking about (usually sold at bodegas and such) is basically sweetened motor oil.

      Mojitos were Ernest Hemingway's drink of choice. Given that the only possible way Hemingway could have been more heterosexual and manly is by wrestling bears while chugging beer and making degrading comments about women, I'm going to have to call shenangians on mojitos being girly.

      It could also be that drinking mojitos was the one girly thing that Hemingway did that was girly which made him human.

      I must admit achilleselbow I only started drinking beer 2 years ago (I'm 31). In Australia the high end stuff is actually quite refreshing, only slightly bitter and leaves your mouth decidedly wet. If you can get your hands on James Squire Amber Ale or Golden Ale, I suggest it. That or Wheat Bier, Hoegarden is odd tasting but just great. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Unfortunately once you've started high-end it becomes a lot easier to work backward (especially at 3am).

      You're right. I went to a shitty loft party last weekend and when me and my friend got there the girl hosting it just handed us both Pabsts. I think a visible cringe passed across my face, but I wasn't about to start explaining my drink preferences, since other times I've done that I've been looked at as if I were some curious member of a lost tribe. So I spent the entire night choking that one can down. Given the weather right now and the fact that they were too hip for air conditioning, it was basically Pabst Tea after half an hour.

      PBR is terrible warm, yes, but you are supposed to be drinking it because it is cheap and you want to get drunk, not because you want to indie pose as hard as you can, thus it should never get warm before you move on to the next.  You should not be tasting that shit.

      Some of the finer things in life are what we call "acquired tastes."  Beer is but one example.  On the other hand, I had no idea that our society has sunk to the level where relatively affluent people drink Pabst to the exclusion of other beer.  And for a party, no less.

      But only 20-30 year old hipsters actually drink Pabst.  You want blue collar?  Start drinking Milkwaukee's Best, Busch Light or Keystone Light. <br/>

The only time I drink Pabst is when it's the cheapest thing at a bar.  I'm still a beer snob, in that I love good beer, but I no longer feel the need to pay 5 bucks for a good beer if I can get a PBR for $1.50...I've pissed away too much money at bars in my life already.

      I don't harbor the illusion that Pabst or Miller High Life give me an air of blue-collar "authenticity", I drink them because they are cheap, but good enough to drink.  I live in Oregon, which is basically Microbrew Central, USA, and I like a lot of good beers, but when I'm in a bar and have a choice between PBR for $1 and Fearless Scotch Ale for $4, I'll buy the PBR every time, even though the Fearless is one of my favorite beers.

      I have the constitution of a small horse, so that "first beer" rule would become "first three beers", so I'm out $12 plus tips for the Fearless, when I could have consumed 12 PBRs for the same price, and 12 is a much larger number than 3, so I will stick with the PBR.

      I am a lover of cheap-ass beer as well (also good beers).  Some really are just crap though. Once I puked after drinking 2 pints of Colt... not from being drunk, just because it's  <em>that shitty of a beer</em> .

      I will straight up tell you that I am a beer geek yet I drink Steel Reserve.  You can get a 24oz (the hard stuff is 8% alcohol) for $1.01.  I think it tastes pretty good for that price. <br/>

      have fun in chicago, i live here and it is AWESOME!  if you are going to be here until monday night by any chance come to friar tuck, it's guitar hero night and the kid who runs it is a big achewood fan.  (the first time i went he was wearing the "what the hell people" shirt and i just about flipped out and we had a great talk. <br/> 
 <br/> 
you don't have to play guitar hero either, i just go to drink.

 <br/> 
Is this a true thing?  I think it is not. <br/>
