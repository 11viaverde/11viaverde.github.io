      That's why this one never sat right with me. First read through I thought there must be some other way to read it than Ray talking about how fake Tiffany gets a man laid.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't think he means anything against Molly and there are times when Ray being totally inappropriate is a joke in itself, but that isn't the joke here. Instead I'm constantly left with this feeling that Onstad was throwing it all away for "hoochie mama wanna-bling", and I don't think that's worth it.

      It is offensive to even suggest that Molly Sanders is in the same league as hoochie mamas and sluts who would appropriate a dresser drawer as a vessel for an infant.
