      The idea that Alanis Morrisette was popular when they were in high school really throws off my sense of time.  I had always imagined the cats as being older than that.  Maybe I'm just projecting?

      <em>Jagged Little Pill</em>  came out June 13, 1995.  If you'd like them to be old, let's say they turned 18 and graduated school in 1996.  That would make them 26 in this strip.  Seems about right for the lifestyle they live. <br/> <br/> <br/> The obsessive fan is analyzing the age of the cartoon cat.

      Hmm. I imagine them being much older than that, but that may just be an effect of _being_ much older than that. I graduated in 1985 (which clearly puts me way outside the dominant demographic of this strip's audience), and I tend to think of the characters as being approximately my age.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I associate Ray's hipster speech patterns with guys more of my parents generation, or even older. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again, my only frames of reference are habits of my own contemporaries, and my kids' pre-school friends. For all I know, you born-in-the-80s types may be all about the Bukowski and beat poetry and the like.  <br/>

      I too have typically imagined them more in the 30s age range. <br/> 
I suppose Onstad must mentally identify with them, putting them more in his own age bracket. <br/> 
26? Jesus. I'm nearly that old. That doesn't seem old. That seems like a slightly more mature teenager. <br/> 
Maybe the cats have just done a lot of living. They are from Circumstances.

      You forget that they're  <em>cats</em> . If they were 26 that would make them about 180 years old in cat time.

      I always kind of wondered.. in the strip where Beef watches Sixteen Candles and Ray tells his mom about it.. when could that have taken place? I mean was Molly Ringwald relevent enough in 1995 that Sandra would know who she is? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again, Sandra does have an exceedingly large hatred for Grace Jones, so she might.

      I assumed they were much younger in that strip. Kids grow out of tattling in elementary school. <br/>

 <em>Sixteen Candles</em>  came out in 1984, or when they might have been in first grade.

      It is a real equation in the sense that it states that two objects, "a^2" and "b-1," are the same thing, and does so in a manner that is "well formed" (ie, x = y 1 is well formed, but as we interpret the symbols, x=1y  is not.)  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, its meaning is another question- a statement the two objects are equal is not particularly powerful unless there are interpretations for those objects ([url="https://achewood.com/index.php?date=05042005]Ray's channelling of Einstein[/url] is an example of a equation which is valid (well, letting him slide on the sigma notation) but which doesn't have much meaning.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
So yes, it is a real equation in that it asserts equality between two well defined objects, but no, it is not a "real equation" in that it has a well established meaning, the way that E=mc^2 or a^2   b^2 = c^2 does.  <br/>

      I've been thinking this for a while, but this strip really cemented it for me: why the hell is Beef even friends with Ray? I mean seriously, we've all known people like him in real life, and if you think about it, the guy's a dick. He's part wigger/part guido/part brah, he never admits a mistake, he covers up his insecurities with ridiculous amounts of bragging, he has zero intellectual curiosity, and he's just hella inconsiderate and rude. I mean yea, it's funny for us to watch his antics, but I'm just saying that if I were RB (which is not too much of a stretch), I'd have ditched him a long time ago.
