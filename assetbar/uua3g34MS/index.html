      The freeness I like, but I can't really get on with the program itself. I'm just too used to Sound Forge, I guess, because it has more in common with the older sample editors I used 10 years ago. It does quite a few things that annoy me, though. I guess instead of complaining about them here, I could post bug reports on the Sourceforge page..

      Ableton is great. The interface is a little confusing to start with, but it eventually makes sense. It's a lot of fun to just play around with, too.

Rate it compared to GarageBand*. <br/> <br/> <br/> *which, though I have little experience with GarageBand, it has the distinct privilege of having said about it "if it's good enough for Trent Reznor to authorise for a remix album, it's good enough for me."

      Audacity's cheap, and you can crtainly use it to make music, but if you can afford to spend a little bit of money it's better to go with Ableton Live (LE), Reason, Acid, etc.  It really depends on your creative process though.

Seriously, I know everyone gives Pro Tools shit because you have to run it off Digidesign hardware, but it is seriously the bomb. It is seven hundred thousand better than Logic. <br/>

Reason is eighty five better than Pro Tools, but in a different way. <br/>

It would encourage discussion on all of the strips, not just the most recent one. And is discussion not the principle our Acheworld is founded on? <br/>

Riazm wishes to unite the Acheworld through a basic program of inbox sorting and little puppy dogs called Mr. Poopytime.

      Okay, spinynorman, prepare to be outgeeked. <br/> 
 <br/> 
With over 5,000 comments to your credit, I think you meant you had over 200  <em>pages</em>  of replies, which would be about 50,000 individual replies.  Sounds about right, since everyone wants to talk to spinynorman. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Second, your metaphor is straight out of  <em>Dark of the Moon</em>  by PC Hodgell:  Tori shouts into a cave that leads to a space-warpy thing, and his sister Jame (who he thinks is dead) hears him at the other end.  She calls back to him, scaring the crap out of him.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
You need to steal your material from even more obscure sources, or make up metaphors that no one else has ever made up before in the history of literature.  Seriously, I'm disappointed with your creativity at this moment. <br/>

      A man should never drink a 'tall' glass of whiskey. Whiskey is a sipping liquor, or a shootin' booze, but when sipping you use a tumbler, when shootin', the bottle. Come on, man. Come on. <br/>

This would have pros and cons - it would ruin the democracy of the system, as society tends to put the popular people on Tiers where their vote means Something More than others. <br/>

Which is kinda the problem with democracy - because, as Socrates said (basically): <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>"The majority of people are really fucking dumb.  Why would you give the vote to those dipshits?  And politicians will want to undermine each other all the damn time, and the actual leader will be like a blind sea captain, with all his crew telling him where to go while secretly wanting to usurp his power.  The whole system is motherfucking ass-backwards."</em> <br/> <br/> <br/> Socrates said that.  Sorta.

      Can't really agree with your suggestion, though I appreciate your version of famous quotes, so I chubbied for that.   <br/> 
I would feel like I needed to pay back people who chubbied me if I knew who they were, and I would thereby dilute the value of the system (what little value there is).  I know others of you are ruthless enough to not care about the people who cubby you, but damn it I'm a sucker for people who are nice to me.  I do not expect chubbies, and am grateful when I receive them and would act accordingly to the detriment of the system.

      This is my whole complaint, really. The fact that its usually Ray. I may get lamed for this, but I'm starting to feel that Ray is "getting things done" and "paying attention" far too much. Every time something goes wrong, woop! There's Ray. I think this comic would be much more interesting if it had been Bensington or Showbiz or, as Drskradley wants, The Boffin. Anyone, really, except Ray.

      Exactly. Ray didn't  <em>have</em>  to be there at all. Showbiz could have blackmailed Beef into giving him money. Or Bensington might have broken his hypnosis and wants to use Beef to get to Ray. Or The Boffin could do...something. Who knows. Point is, Ray is becoming far too prevalent in this comic as a whole. Sure, he's a good character, but there can be too much of a good thing. I kind of want Ray to go on a three month vacation somewhere. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What I'd like to see is a story arc in which Chucklebot falls in love with Pat and employs Nice Pete to help Pat break up with Rod Huggins. We haven't seen any of the robots in ages, let alone Pat and Nice Pete. Ray needs a time-out.

      the bottom part was where I copied and pasted the url into the post, so that I could type it for link without having to go back to the other window and look at it again, because I've had copy/pasting issues in the past.  But then I forgot to delete it so it's all sitting there making me look like an idiot.  On a positive note, however, I now know that assetbar won't fuck up a url copy/paste, so I can just do that in the future.

      Or maybe Onstad beefed up Beef a bit for more than one reason. It seems like good way of showing his new confidence, and his newfound breadwinner status (blue collar working man). It's also useful for the cat lady to use as a cheap pick up line.

      Truth be told, I was kind of hoping that the person to trip Roast Beef would be anyone other than Ray, if only in order to get Beef a little more fucked. Not to turn this into a soap opera or nothing, but just enough to complete the rock starish allusion that Onstead was making with Beef's greeting card success.

      For some reason, I assumed that there would be a scene similar to the one in "Catcher in the Rye", involving the prostitute and Leon?

"Potter's Field was also the name of a small cove of the East River just below the Williamsburg Bridge on the Brooklyn side, where bodies that have been in the river from November through the winter season surface in April as the rising temperature causes them to decompose and rise to the surface. The fluid dynamics of the East River causes a collection of these bodies every year off the docks of Potter's Field."

      Heh,  <em>Tango...</em>  is my preferred funeral song. That or  <em>Frankenstein</em>  by the Edgar Winter Group from their live performance on "The Old Grey Whistle Test" with the video playing on a stadium sized plasma screen. 9 plus minutes of the same lumbering riff broken only by a duelling drumsolo and punctuated by an albino freak (Edgar himself) frantically swapping instruments.  <br/>

      No, I agree, I would like to see more of the other characters. Especially Emeril. When I first read the Emeril strips I didn't like them all that much, mainly because I couldn't get a handle on his speech patterns. But now I think he's one of my favorite characters. Ray is awesome and all, but he seems to have been a bit overused lately.

      I am with you up to the arrogant assertion of cutural supremecy that you seem to harbour. I legitimately hope that none of the comments against you had truly offended you, because, God help me, I would like to see you stick around a bit. Just know that any true cutting edge is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. Not to say that your brand of humour is a lukewarm Lipton Earl Grey served in a styrofoam cup, just that it ought find the right channel. What can I say, but Achewood attracts iconoclasts of all kinds. There are bound to be your kinds as well, buried in the vitriol.

And dude, I appreciate what you do, and sometimes I find it funny, but mega-lames don't mean a thing, dogg. They just mean that a large amount of people found your comment lame. Just because we all are annoyed by an annoying thing definitely does not mean we all have this fascist, groupthink mentality. Or that we get frustrated that we cannot decipher the incredible wit and intelligence of your posts with our primitive simian minds and, grunting, hit the lame button. Here's the secret:  <em>It just means that some people on a messageboard on a comic on the internet thing you have said a thing that is lame.</em>

      It was genuinely fascinating.  From a Mind/Brain Theory and even an epistemological standpoint, it changed the way we view what the Mind is made of - prior to this, debates raged (with most backers still in the camp of Cartesian or other forms of Dualism) that the Mind is non-physical, and thus equating to the Soul or somehow on the spiritual plane.  Therefore, also, equating emotions, personality, sensation and otherwise personal experience to also be spiritual (don't get me started on how this has unfortunately influenced the Church in regards to the classification and treatment of mental illness). <br/> 
 <br/> 
But the fact that some dude can have a completely unspiritual and utterly earthly-plane-bound metal spike jammed through his noggin, and resultingly have his entire personality changed from a self-controlled, wholesome and temperate family man to a bar-brawling, psychotic and mean-spirited drunkard blew a lot of this out of the water, and is still a perfect example of the effect of the physical on the brain, and thus, on the mind/personality and possibly the essence of your being.  You couldn't  <em>ask</em>  for a better scientific example.

      Kind of random here and a bit of a shot in the dark... but... if anyone is in the D.C. area and is going to the DC 101 Chili Cook-Off tomorrow I will be participating. I will have my Teodor apron on. I am in Row 1. We will be under a large Redskins tent. On the off chance you are going and come across this feel free to drop by and get some food.

      Like I said yesterday, Ray was virtually a given and all of the theories to the contrary were pretty much based on conjecture and boredom. <br/>

Still, props to those who spotted the Airwolf foreshadowing. I thought the sun/helicopter sequence was just a nod to artsy film direction.

      I have to figure out what legal channels one has to go through to get a viking burial approved.  I'd be loaded on a boat with some hay and all my important personal belongings (I'm imagining a bottle of scotch and a stack of porno mags), then set adrift to serve as floating target practice for some archers with flaming arrows.  I think the most difficult part would be to find archers skilled enough to guarantee that I would be ignited, because that would be kind of embarrassing, me all corpsified, floating out to sea with a boat full of liquor and porno, nobody wants to be remembered like that.

      Well, as an amateur time traveler, I can say with quite a bit of authority that this strip isn't going to end anytime in the next 20,000,000 years, though none of the principle characters survive past 2060 (sans Philippe and the robots, of course) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some future storylines to watch out for: <br/> 
 <br/> 
-Civil war erupts within the council of the Great Outdoor fight. Ray's sons Honky Love and Ray Jr. stand on opposite sides of the conflict <br/> 
-A new character, Bob Doubledon, is introduced, the focus of the strip begins to shift to his escapades <br/> 
-Ray is slowly raised up to the status of a god after his death <br/> 
-Philippe adopts a baby bird <br/> 
-Lie Bot merges his consciousness with a supercomputer and eradicates 90% of all life on earth, keeping only Philippe for company <br/> 
-Vlad is launched into space <br/> 
-Lie Bot is destroyed by a group of renegade animals called "The friends of Smuckles" <br/> 
-Philippe becomes king of a small island in the middle of old Achewood Lake <br/> 
-Strip goes on hiatus after Humanity is destroyed by the genetically-engineered servent crabs they created.  <br/> 
-Strip returns from hiatus, becomes much more crab-oriented <br/> 
-Philippe finds a quarter (one of my personal favorite strips) <br/> 
-The probe containing Vlad (who now possesses god-like powers) returns to earth <br/> 
-Crabby McCakington (one of the strips focal characters during the crab years) buys a scuttlecar, finds out it is possessed <br/> 
-Philippe has too much applesauce and becomes just livid. <br/> 
-The beetle-people which will eventually become the dominant life-form on this planet are featured for the first time. <br/> 
-Crableton S Cakeington (Great-great-great grandson of Crabby) enters the Great Outdoor fight <br/> 
-Philippe goes to France (Now called QW'THsqWwW'RrtT)

      One real quick thing I took from this strip (this is not a criticism, I loved it) is that perhaps Onstad is afraid to really hurt Roast Beef more than his inner hurt already hurts him daily.

      Disagree. Rap parody is the genre of humor that never gets old. I could listen to that Josh Tobin "I'm a Gangster" shit every day until my eardrums rot out. I don't even  <em>care</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
But anyway, that is irrelevant, because Frontalot isn't doing rap parody. He's doing nerdcore rap. There's a healthy sense of humor about it, sure, but it's genuine, and he's very talented.

      I mean...kinda. I am certainly not going to hold your head in a toilet until you agree with my musical taste, but nerdcore isn't  <em>all</em>  satirical. Part of its appeal is definitely that nerdy white kids aren't supposed to be the ones rapping, but it's also that they are just using a medium in a way it hasn't been used yet.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is a lot of genuine emotion in, for example, "I Heart Fags," as well as a lot of using the medium of rap to create sick rhymezz or whatever. It's kinda funny because rap has not been known for its friendliness toward gay people, but then again, there's no reason that rap can't or shouldn't be about loving fags. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, yo, we can agree to disagree. I'll just go watch that  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925101719/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_7OlVQjxpk">Olde English Food Rap</a>  thing for like the thousandth time and you can point and laugh at my lowbrow revelry. I am cool with that.

      Just to clarify: there are a lot of crappy rappers in more mainstream genres of rap, but there are a lot of good ones because of the sheer volume of material available.  Nerdcore has a few people who get it but mostly people who think whining over a beat is a good style.

      Hm, I do think there is quite a bit more long-term character development, change, and growth in Achewood than in your average sitcom, I've always attributed some of those traits as being just the character getting honed?  (you mean the character that I... <em>honed</em> ?) <br/> 
 <br/> 
Like, before Cornelius was in the style of Frasier, he was more or less interchangeable with Teodor.  Before Ray was made to be rich, he was Pat with sunglasses.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But since that sort of overhaul of the characters, where they started to have those emergent personality traits, they've remained fairly stasis.  Not that it is a bad thing, a character that is constantly changing or developing makes for either a drama, or bad writing.  You're more or less right, but for me, it seems like the characters found a rhythm and have kept the pace since then.  And it all came together when Mom sang along!

      Yes but people habitually come back to life. Beef was always poor and ostracized whereas Ray's Mom showed up with many types of soda. There's a difference between adding details to characters and changing their basic nature. Cornelius will never become a NASCAR fan; Beef won't cheer up and Ray has always had that magic charm around his neck.

      The Best Comment I Never Made <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had a dream a few nights ago that a new Achewood strip was posted featuring someone playing a guitar shaped like Teodor. I was immediately struck by dream inspiration and posted: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"That band was originally supposed to be accompanied by a drum machine, but they made the mistake of putting the Philippe-shaped amp on top of the manual." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I woke up before I could find out if I received any dream-chubbies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yeah, so, this didn't have anything to do with this strip, but I couldn't think of a better place to post it.

      Tonight, after a few glasses of wine, I was looking at Friday's strip and imagining Chris making it. I know how hard it is to get those lines just right in Illustrator. You keep moving the cursor back and forth, and sometimes no matter where you start, the line just won't curve correctly. I was imaging him cutting and pasting the characters and resizing or cropping them to fit correctly withing the frame. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the text: maybe he typed those line lines out quickly as his instinctive mind dictated, and then typed and retyped them for hours to get them just right. Maybe he went out for lunch, or played a game with him daughter in between these things. He probably talked to some people about some things, important things, on the telephone.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
What must it be like to be Chris Onstadt? He is just a guy doing his job, who just happens to be lucky enough to have been really successful at something that he enjoys. And we appreciate that. If you are reading this Chris, really, we do.

      Yeah, why do people expect a comic every single day? xkcd only posts Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and it is a) rarely as funny as Achewood, b) almost never as long, and c) the drawing is shitty. Even if it's not, Randall Munroe obviously doesn't put as much effort into it as Onstad does.

sure, girls find out about it if i take my shirt off.  but i figure, hey, if a girl is looking at my torso, then it's probably already too late to change her mind about what's going to happen next.
