      I almost posted a comment saying that Pat is out of character in this strip, but then I realized I was wrong. It's a great thing about Achewood that the characters are so multi-dimensional, not defined by a single aspect. No one, not even Pat, is an asshole ALL of the time, and despite the fact that he's a militant vegan, he feels sympathy for his friend after seeing a Magreaux dog.

      Pat's just being pragmatic here. He's under the impression that something very bad is going to happen, he's resigned himself to it, and he knows things are going to have to be done. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The sick thing is, I kind of feel Pat. When you think like him, you see stupid people doing stupid things, you see people over reacting or just not acknowledging a problem, and after a while, it starts to get to you. You find yourself getting upset at things that really shouldn't bother you. The world at large doesn't give a shit about global warming, and there's nothing you can do to change that. I can see where Pat's anger comes from, and it's a shame he can't deal with it better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cue this comment being lamed into invisibility for sympathizing with Pat/not making some kind of crack about Pat taking it in the can.

      At first I was going to chubby this post to reassure you, because I generally agree with your position. <br/> 
Then I started feeling manipulated by your last line, and started thinking maybe it was just a ploy to get chubbies. <br/>

So I'm not going to do anything. I figure these two facets balance out. In a kinder world I might have chubbied you, but it was not to be.
