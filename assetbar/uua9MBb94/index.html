      ...here's what I get for assuming the previous day's delay/fuckup was still in effect. A bright yellow badge of shame and the first creeping hints of a vodka hangover. <br/> 
 <br/> 
While I'm at it, remind me to hide the vodka before hosting a cocaine freak at my store after hours. The bulk of that was for a party that got subverted for purposes I do not endorse.

      Yes, Germany's genocide efforts were (unfortunately) not unprecedented.  However, unlike Rowanda, the USSR, etc., the Nazis were not cognizant that they were undertaking pure evil.  Thus they made no effort to hide their atrocities.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Countries have a tendency to put aside moral conundrums when they get in the way of power.  To wit: the US had no qualms about snatching up known Nazi's after the war.  They were given new identities and became US citizens.  Some (like Von Braun) are considered great Americans. <br/>

"Ha, Nazi schmazi," says Wernher von Braun <br/> 
 <br/> 
Don't say that he's hypocritical <br/> 
Say rather that he's apolitical <br/> 
"Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down <br/> 
That's not my department," says Wernher von Braun <br/>

      The part about it being poisonous?  <br/> 
Its like that Denis Leary rant in "Asshole" where he's, "gonna get the Duke and John Cassavetes and Lee Marvin and Sam Peckinpah and..." by the time he gets to "and a case of whiskey", its like "and its poisonous". You're still listening, its interesting, but its barely clicking anymore. Really, its more of an action figure than an animal, "now, with beaver tail, duck bill, poisonous barbs and its own 'platy-bus' action vehicle!", trying to cram in just all the crazy, crazy bells and whistles that you can.

 <em>Hecci, you lost.  Anyway, it's that time.  I'm way over your style.  Fact-checked!  My limo home is here.  Too late, ah?</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Commentary: <br/> 
Here, Glad tries to convince his Internet crush that he's over her.  He insists that he's his own man now, successful and self-confident, with his own limo.  After posting to Assetbar, though, he hugs a framed printout of her handfacepic avatar and cries himself to sleep. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Tune in next week for another exciting episode of  <em>Glad I'm Not You</em> !

      Pat is supposed to be a dick.  That's  the main premise of his character. <br/>

As for Teodor, Molly, Ray, and Beef, they've all done crappy things before, but they've also done a lot of good things, and I don't think any of them has done anything unforgivably horrible.  They may be assholes sometimes, but I don't think any of the four of them is any more of an asshole than the average person.

      Let it be known that on this, the morning of Sunday, December 6th, 2009, I pressed the "chubby" option under an AIU post before ignoring it (nothing personal, by the way - it's just that I use a really shitty computer and some of your posting habits really give the old girl the fits). Plummet has been on my ignore list for so long that I can hardly even remember why I hated him, but I think it's fair to say that he is among the small handful of regular posters who even AIU can see is a total fucking waste of space. I mean, sure, AIU really fucks shit up, but at least he's vaguely interesting.

      I haven't found plummet's posts annoying or worth ignoring lately.  I think it's rather anti-social of you to ignore him.  just his choice of avatar is kinda questionable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
as for ignoring every AIU account you can find, don't bother... if AIU decides he wants to unleash a browser crashing series of posts, you can be sure he's going to do it with a fresh account that no one has had a chance to ignore yet.  You might wanna expand your mind a little bit and give people a little more benefit of the doubt, otherwise you will box yourself into a rather ugly world.  to some extent, the world is what you perceive it to be.

      When I was six there was a girl who lived up the block from me that told me she wanted me to be her boyfriend but I refused. One day, in an attempt to make me jealous, she gave my little brother (age three) several kisses on the cheek and raved about how cute he was. I told her it wasn't working but not long after that it was evening and I wanted to go out to play with her but my Mom and Dad said I had to eat dinner and I didn't want to because it was chicken noodle soup and I wasn't sick. My Dad gave me a spanking and I went to bed without any dinner. Eventually she moved away. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I found her on facebook earlier this year. She lives in Maryland, not too far outside of town. She has a little baby boy and I looked through page after page of photos of her tickling and kissing her adorable child, searching for pictures of the father, and finding none. <br/>

      yeah you preachin to that quire when I look on the personals adverts online it's like every other chick has some kids and so many of them are fat even the chicks who don't have kids are fat a lot of the times and they are like 'my kids are my life' which okay I understand that kids are very much the most important thing in the world I understand that yes I do they are most important thin in the world for me too even though I don't have any I love my friend's kids so much I can't even imagine what if I had my own kids okay well I don't love them as much now that they are becoming teenagers and starting to become assholes some of them but anyway so my point is sure your kids are most important thing in the world to you but if that is pretty much the only thing you can think of to put in your profile, then, you must not have life beyond your kids, I mean, any life at all, no interests, no hobbies, no awareness even of anything else, and that is very sad for those kids because it is not enough to offer kid your love, you have to offer them a love of life and a love of the world, you have to show them the world, and for that to happen, you have to be well rounded enough such that you can think of more to say in your online personals other than "if you has any questions just ax me" yeah I have questions bitch that's why they put those fields that you didn't fill out so that you can start to give me an idea about you if you're not going to fill out the fields then why do we even have personals web sites in the first fucking place why don't we just dial random phone numbers on our phone until someone picks up?  dumb bitches!  and many of them put pictures of they kids on they personals ads.  what the fuck up with that.  like big advertisement for pedophiles or something.  this one women, she put on her personals ad something like "you are not going to get anywhere near my kids until I have dated you for X number of months" or something like that.  it's like... holy shit... from one extreme to the other. so many fucking psychos and idiots out there.  but that's the way it is.  you got to figure just from the way that people drive that most of them is idiots.  like when you signal for change lanes, and people keep coming by you even when you are signaling.  sometimes, someone directly behind you, in same lane as you are, instead of let you change lanes, will change lanes in order to pass you, then change back into same lane, when if they would just fucking let you change lanes, they could have proceeded faster without haiving to do all that shit.  dumb fucking people.  when I signal to change lanes, I give people around me some time to recognize what I am wanting to do,  after that, if people want to keep driving by me, I change lanes anyway, kinda slowly, but if someone directly heading for me, I don't let that stop me, I keep changing lanes anyway.  they are all honking like what the fuck are you doing.  they get pissed sometimes.  But you can't let other people walk all over you.  I know you are thinking well it would be stupid of me to have an accident.  I figure if someone stupid enough or road rage enough to hit someone, they might as well hit me instead of hit someone else.  At least I am expecting it.  maybe it could be some mom in a mini van full of kids that accidently cuts someone off, that someone might hit her and cause bad accident.  I figure better they hit me.  But I haven't been hit yet.  haven't even traded paint yet, but it's been real close.  But that's how people drive, they don't understand safety margarine.  That is another pet peeve of mine, is people who drive directly behind you, all tailgate you, is terrible, because if you has to stop for whatever reason, they is going to fuck you up.  sometimes semi will pull up directly behind you even.  a sport ute is bad enuff, a semi is like 50 times heavier.  I mostly don't have that problem because I mostly drive around 55 MPH in the slow lane, so erry one passes me in the fast lane, but sometimes if I is in hurry, and I want to do like 70 in fast lane, that is terrible, because always people piling up behind you, riding your ass, tailgating you.  when that happens, only one thing to do.  two things actually.  first try put on flashers.  sometimes that works and they back off.  usually not.  other thing to do, is slow down to 40 MPH, right there in fast lane.  I don't hit the brakes, I just put on flashers and take it out of gear. (is stick shift) and pretty soon they give up and they pass you.  I will do that with a semi behind me too, I don't give a fuck.  Is sort of defeats purpose of wanting to drive fast, but what can you do, better to drive safe without a whole line of assholes tailgating you than to be fast.  two seconds following distance, assholes.  two seconds.  absolutely minium.  if you is going 70 MPH, that is distance of rougly 60 meters in two seconds.  (meter is kinda lika yard) so average car is what maybe 5 meters so that is distance of 12 car lenghts safe to follow distance.  most people do 6 at the most.  I could not date someone or be with woman who follows at unsafe follow distance.  can't be with someone that dumb fucking stupid.  or who smokes cigarette.  weed is different weed is okay at least you get some good drug from weed, and some study show that weed helps to protect against cancer, even though at the same time it has more cancergerans than cigarettes, the protective factor of thc helps to offset.  but smoke cigarette?  What kind of pussy ass drug is the nicoteen?  you a pussy if you addicted to nicoteen.  if you can't quit nicoteen, then life is maybe just too rough for you and you need to just shoot yourself in tha head or go drive on that turnpike tailgate someone until you has an accident and impale windshield wiper in your head.  best is people who is tailgate and who is directly next to semi at same time.  look at me look at me I is building my own coffin.  dumb fucks don't understand some shit.  when time to pass semi, I put myself behind semi, in passing lane, not next to semi, but behind it, so if semi suddenly change lane he in front of me not run me over or so if I suddenly has blowout or something I not veer under semi cut my roof off or get run over.  I put myself behind semi.  wait for when driver in front of me has proceeded past semi, then I pass semi.  it is usually while wait for clear that asshole start to tailgate me, so then I drop out of gear slow down until the start to pass me, then if I is kinda feeling like they is asshole, or if there is too many other idiot behind them, then I speeds up again, keep them from pass me, back to position behind semi, wait for clear to pass.  I mean fuck, how hard is to figure out "maybe this guy doesn't want me to tailgate him."  they is in such a hurry to advance 5 meter so they can tailgate car in front of me, while this car is in process of pass semi at rate of speed of 1/2 mph faster than the semi.  most times however I just let the cars proceed to tailgate guy in front of me if at all possible, just get out of they way.  sometimes when they tailgate idiot riding next to semi, it help the idiot to move out of the way.  sometime it result in deadly accident.  either way, I don't want to tailgate people, even for purpose of pressure them to get the fuck out of the way.  It's bad enough for you when someone tail gate you, but is even more dangerous for you when you tailgate someone else, because then you has no control over what idiocy they might do in front of you.  I looked up my old gf once (okay, maybe it was about 200 times) and one time when I look her up on the google I found her in court records posted online for DUI.  she has kid too.  I wonder if she ever dumped that pot smoking drunkard of a boy friend she was with.  she hasn't mentioned him to me in a long time so maybe he is gone.  I would imagine.  she was quite a bit in love with him last time I saw her, but hten again she had just met him.  I wonder maybe reality set in after a while that he is loser.  ah well.  what can you do.  don't tailgate, and don't put up with it when people tailgates you.  be good to yourself peeps.  peace out.

      when i was in kindergarten there was a little girl in my class that lived up the street from me and i used to play with her all the time.  i dont remember any kind of "kid-bf-gf" kind of stuff, but we were friends and our mothers were friends.  anyhow, one day she was out playing on the sidewalk in front of her house and some drunken cockhead ran her over and she died.  that cockhead sonofabitch got out of jail after 9 months.  so, no, they sometimes stay a kid themselves.

      if you ever want to steal a dead body out of a cemetery it's best to go for the kids otherwise you might wind up like those crooks on the funny TV shows where the show the surveillance video trying to steal an ATM and gets it out the front door and then can't lift it into his pickup truck and has to drive away without it. <br/>

I would have thought the bed of a pickup would accomodate virtaully any coffin, barring those bespoke ones used by the can't-leave-my-apartment whale people. However, I'm just speculating, as adult coffins are outside my area of expertise.

      Dunkin' Donuts needs to be after the West Coast cut-off as we don't really have them out here. Likewise In-and-Out is more of a Southern California thing than a West Coast one. It can be rather hard to find them outside of that area because they only have one or two distribution centers (and since they don't freeze it that limits the distance) and the own all the stores themselves. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm also quite disappointed to fail to see Carl's Jr./Hardees on the list. It should have a special choice of whether you feel like living anymore (No -> get the tacos).

      Cookout should be on there as well. It's a very small chain, only in North Carolina, South Carolina, and maybe Georgia -- but it is the best fast food in the country bar none. I have had In-and-Out and it cannot compare. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At Cookout you get a burger, drink and two sides for 5 bucks -- and they consider CHICKEN NUGGETS a side and HUSH PUPPIES a side.And they are good nuggets and hushpuppies too.The burgers are just as good as In-and-Outs and they come with so much more for the price. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And for an extra .75 your drink can be a shake which mixes any number of over 40 ice cream flavors. <br/> <br/> <br/> It is one of the only things I miss about North Carolina.

      Yeah, Cookout ain't half bad.  Good shakes.  Fries are just OK, i think, but pretty good burgers.  I'd take it over overrated fucking Five Guys anyday.   <br/>

      I don't know, I had some really good fried chicken a bit ago. One of those overpriced upscale comfort food places decided to open a window selling it in an alleyway near the ballpark and they do a damn good job with some tasty-ass spices in there. Plus, chicken and waffles. Not exactly my scene, but I have to commend them for doing it. I mean, I'm not about to pay $20 for a fried catfish dinner, but when I can get a two piece with waffles or a po'boy for $7.50 that's rockin' me pretty hard in the flavor can. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dammit, I need to make a post that isn't just about local hipster food.

      Come live in Amsterdam for a year or two, until the near-complete absence of decent restaurants or takeaway food makes it seem like Burger King makes a good burger and Dominos makes a good pizza. Terrifying. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really want to try this Cookout place you speak of. Can anyone mail me one of those $5 meals? Even after a couple of weeks in transit, it will still probably outshine what's available locally.

      There is a local spot that actually does some damn good burgers, but they're doing them all fancied up.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's a blend of aged short ribs, chuck, and brisket done up in some odd form they call "granulation" (it's apparently based off of a technique developed by Heston Blumenthal where the ground strands are loosely formed into a "column" and then sliced into patties) and then seared in beef fat. Topped off with cheese, carmelized onion, and caper aioli on a toasted bun from a local bakery of repute. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Eight bucks (one of which goes to charity) and they're operating out of the meat counter of a Chinese supermarket in the Hispanic part of town.  Which also since become the hipster part of town and why they're doing this sort of thing. It's kind of a cool idea that people are offering delicious food out of odd locations where they can rent space for cheap since they can't afford their own place mixed with a big load of pretension for trying to be all underground. <br/> 
 <br/> 
All I can say is that I dreamed about one of those fucking things last night. <br/> 
 <br/> 
On a side note what the fuck is up with putting burgers on the griddle lately? Crust?!? What the fuck is wrong with you people! Burgers have to be done on the goddamn grill so you get that delicious smoky flavor. Yeah, I've had griddled burgers and enjoyed them, but it's not the same thing. It's like enjoying some deep-dish pizza. It's a special deviant pleasure, but not one that replaces the proper way. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, J. Kenji Alt's replication of the Shake Shack burger sounded pretty solid. Any idea how he couldn't get that in Cook's Illustrated? It beats the everliving fuck out of his fairly generic and half-assed beef stew recipe in the current issue. I mean, anchovies to increase beefy flavor? Why in the fuck do you think we've all known about using Worcestershire sauce all these years. Not to mention acting like putting in a dollop of tomato paste was some sort of secret. <br/>

      sorry about that.  I discovered an exploit that allowed you to force other people to give out lames and chubbies, and that also allowed to to force other people to rate strips, and I kinda went a little crazy with it.  they fixed the chubby and lame thing, and it looks like they have disabled rating strips pending a fix for that too.

      Because it was such an original, creative, interesting response, right? <br/>

At least mine has the vague mystery (albeit easily explained) of how your ma's bunghole came to be hot and bloody. I was considering going with 'suppurating' or 'purulent', but I didn't want to risk startling you. "Hot brass coin" was another alternative, but it seemed a bit abstract. <br/>

      If by the term 'vague mystery' you mean undefined and ambiguous, you hit the mark. 'Discuss deeze nuts' sounded like it took .5 seconds to think of and means seven-eighths of f*ck all to me. And even better, by choosing this remark over some of your more eloquent choices, you assume  <em>I'm</em>  some kind of pig-f*cking retard. Perhaps you should read some of my posts over the years and you will see I%u2019m at least a little above the bottom of the evolutionary tree. <br/> 
N.B. fairplay with the Spartacus spelling, now put that line back in nice-on-water%u2019s ear whence I placed it, If you're nice enough I'll give you a personalised insult to play with. <br/> 
Many thanks. <br/> 
P.S. I'd lay off the bloody bunghole fantasies if I were you, I think you're in danger of unseating a repressed memory of your Dad and a loofah, perhaps that's why you shudder every time you watch documentaries about subtropical vines, hmmm?

      I find it quite weird when people type 'f*ck' on the internet. I mean, you're writing the word for all intents and purposes. You're causing it to be mentally spoken in the heads of people who read your text, so why the aversion to typing good old 'fuck'? <br/>

Since you're happy (as am I) to employ images of bestial buggery, it seems especially odd to wuss out when it comes to the actual 'fuck'. Gnome sane? <br/>

      Well, it's just a crazy idea. Sort of like how nobody seems to take issue with bowdlerization through the use of another word, like Battlestar Galactica's use of "frak". We know what it means. What know what it's a stand-in for. More importantly, however, the meaning and intent is exactly the same. It seems to come from a deeply odd place where people fear the actual word itself rather than it's use. <br/>

      html is pretty standard stuff.  you can browse through all the javascripts that make up assetbar simply by hitting "view source" and then extrapolating the URLs of the scripts from the relative URLs at the top of the page, but none of the exploits I have ever discovered relied in any way on any of assetbar's source.  it's always been stupid stuff, like realizing that I can embed my own javascripts into fields that are subsequently rendered intact.  that's like one of the most basic exploits out there.  you'd think that no one should make that mistake anymore, ever.  yet, twitter made that mistake a few months ago.

      One guess I have is that maybe they have changed assetbar so that it gives you that error ("trouble identifying who you are") if the referrer on the 'chubby' or 'lame' request is not m.assetbar.com.  But I could be wrong.  it could have to do with cookies and milk and cows or whatever.  maybe you need to try using a different web browser.

            philophobe: Chris, I'm curious if you've taken any inspiration from Cormac McCarthy in writing Nice Pete's character. In my mind, he seems especially to have an affinity with Judge Holden from Blood Meridian (which, I think, is still McCarthy's best, although both Suttree and The Road are nearly equal, Oprah notwithstanding). <br/> 
 <br/> 
            None of which is a criticism, by the way. Who doesn't love to wake up on a -20 windchill Thursday to read another tale from the formative years of an occasionally gentlemanly sociopath? <br/>

            It's Pete's mom. There's no way any man, no matter how drunk, or how West Virginian, would desire sex from his mother-in-law. <br/>
