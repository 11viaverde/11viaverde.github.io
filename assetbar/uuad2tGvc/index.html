      Yours better described me than mine, unfortunately. I tend to challenge the winter weather with as few layers as possible, so I probably wouldn't wear a sweater even if I owned one. Plus I seldom walk for pleasure. <br/>

Falling over in order to lighten a mood is something that I must admit to having done in the past, though.

      I feel like I know you less than I know the other Assetbarbarians, ilovekate.  Maybe it's because you post a lot less since I came on. <br/>

In my awkward years (Sophomore year of high school), I tended to wear up to five or six layers at once, three during the summer.  And I love long walks by myself.

      I do post less. This is saddening. I've been trying harder recently, though. It's the jerks, mainly. Back in the day, the line between the mildly caustic and the genuine troll was so clear to me. Now, there is confusion. There is contention, and  <em>drama</em> . I just don't enjoy it as much.

      Yeah, but if we misinterpret both the words and the language we could end up with  <em>leche</em> . I took Latin though so dealing with any other Romance language is a lot of fumbling around. It's like middle school make outs. Or so I assume they might be if I had actually ever had any. Or even high school make outs.

      That would be very nice, but I have a girlfriend for makeouts now. Perhaps you could transfer the makeouts to her. That would probably work pretty well. I do not want to push though. This has already gotten pretty thoroughly creepy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do appreciate the desire to help, but, as far as basic makeouts are concerned, I no longer have a problem here. Maybe if there was a way to convince girls to desire to have makeouts with me in the past that would nice. But I do not think we currently have that technology and I'd also be pretty jealous of past-me which would cause further problems.

      Well, it's just the way of things. The hammer and screwdriver are simple tools, but you'll use them far more often than any fancy, well-designed tool. A hammer is always great for whenever you just want to pound on something and that screwdriver is likely coming out for all sorts of prying that it wasn't designed for simply because it's there and it'll work. <br/>

      Right now we all still seem to be kind of half-joking about it. I think this is because as much as we may want it to happen, many of us don't have jobs (at least not well-paying ones), and would probably feel strange about flying across the country to hang out with people from the Internet.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
At least that is what I am surmising. Personally, I would actually be willing to shell out for a plane ticket, but probably not for a hotel. I don't know how many other people feel this way. I do remember that Southwest meetup that Tekende and others tried to organize didn't happen, so I'm not too optimistic.

      I went to at least one meetup for an Internet community (Everything2) but that was held locally. People flew in and others drove a significant distance to attend. There were a lot of them though and the community there was pretty interested in having meets. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You totally have a point though. Most of us are either students or in that post-student "I don't have any damn money" phase. If not I suspect that we have money, but not time and we're probably not in the habit of doing that sort of thing due to family and other commitments. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's really just a shame that we're all so spread out. I think of us regulars there are maybe only two or three of us in each reasonably drivable region. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Otherwise I would totally be up for hosting. You guys just need to live closer to Achewood.

      How many people could you fit in your place though? Like, even if everyone crashed on the floor? I'm thinking that if at least like five of the regular posters showed up, it could be a Thing, but preferably it would be somewhere around eight or ten to make it worth the trip. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, we should talk about this again in a few months. Daedala mentioned that she might be relocating, and I might possibly be as well, so we'll see where everyone ends up.

      Hmm... I'm moving so I don't have a great idea, but it's a two bedroom place and one of the rooms will be used as a computer room with some storage so there should be plenty of space. <br/> 
 <br/> 
At some point it might be wise to inform the girlfriend that I have invited the Internet to come stay with us for a while. <br/>

I think there would be room for about eight or ten though. Or you could experience local culture and go sleep in the park. It's only two blocks away.

      My new place actually has a second toilet in a small room containing nothing else just next to the bathroom. I find it odd that it's not  <em>en suite</em>  with the master bedroom, but that's the way it's built. I used to have an  <em>en suite</em>  half bath at a previous apartment and it was very useful, but it was a full half, this is just a toilet room.

      It was quite awesome. Pseudo_Intellectual is a very interesting bearded young man of the type you might have assumed. He is definitely Canadian.

It was a great time to be had by all. I got a bit screwed up and missed bits though like the trip to a local playground for early morning fun. <br/>

      Indeed. I spent about 20 hrs/week playing the original in college with friends. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, it feels a bit like you're just hanging around the house and not having proper fun. I worry about that sometimes. I mean, if that is all we ever do whenever we hang out it seems like maybe it is not such a great thing.

      Well, for most of the time I did so I was since I was the one who both did not drink and owned a car. Worked out well. Also we knew the bartender and much of the staff fairly well. I think I have related this story before, but Dave, he was on The Amazing Race one season (I do not watch reality shows and when I found out it was coming into the bar and being like "Dude, why is Dave is TV?!?") worked there and we usually went when he was tending bar and would sit around watching, often, Dog the Bounty Hunter (I cannot be held accountable for his poor choices in television). <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would still be able to pull that here, but everyone just takes public transit so not really any designated drivers.

      i was at this concert once (Taste of Chaos tour to be exact, i was young and liked silly music), and the singer from The Used got onstage with the singer from My Chemical Romance right after their last song and he walked up to him and they STARTED MAKING OUT OMIGAWD IT WAS SO HOT. <br/>

i am sorry if i like boys who wear makeup and look like girls and have makeouts with each other. it's kind of my Thing. not that i take it seriously. i mean, guys don't usually take things they find hot seriously either, do they.

      In Montparnasse Cemetary by any chance?  If so I believe my wife may have kicked you while you were down.  I apologize for her action and my discourtesy in not helping you to stand again.  Though I don't bring it up at dinner, we disagree about Sartre as a matter of course.  She loves him, I think he wrote volumes and volumes without ever proving anything.  I will endeavor to bring it up in private conversation more often to get her accustomed to the idea that others disagree about Sartre.  I'm sorry it is too late to save you from your fate.

      I love prog rock. Be it classic Rush or King Crimson on up to Coheed and Cambria I am totally your man for prog. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I see myself more as someone who knows the correct answers to the mysteries at the center of the plot and I tell the protagonist early on, but I am ignored in the rush of things. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I would like to join the progtagonist and lay down some truly fat prog bass lines, but I'm not quite that skilled yet. Actually, being a bassist is also a really great way to be completely ignored despite making valuable contributions that are ultimately correct. It's also a great way to be a lazy dick who just plays the root (and maybe the 5th if you're feeling fancy) of the guitar chords in straight eighths. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This now needs to be a prog rock epic. I can think of no better way to convey what needs to be done here.

Agreed.  No offense to those "popular choices" (heccibiggs, tekende, spinynorman, et al), but if I ever actually gave a shit and thought about who my favorite assetbar posters are, paperboy would be in the top 3, at the  very least.

      SSRIs have a tendency to take away your sex drive.  Not for everyone, but for lots of people, men and women. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mention this because the subject of virginity came up earlier, and a reduced sex drive can make such a condition easier to bear. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Not that I would know anything about that myself, of course.

      ...The machine elves. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They have no souls, and very likely do not exist in our mortal plane. They are whispering spirits who never had a body to lose. They are omnipresent and nonexistent at once -- machinations of pure hate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They galivant about our world, seeking hatred or offense. If anyone, anywhere, finds something offensive or lame, the machine elves swoop in and latch onto it -- screeching "LAAAME!  <em>LAAAAAME!</em> " with ghoulish falsettos.

      I don't know.  I find my sister watching Degrassi, and every time someone is getting raped, shot, crippled, impregnated, aborted, gay-bashed, or what have you.  And there is always a B plot about cheating boy friends or some catty bitch calling another catty bitch ugly or whatever. <br/>

Also, look at Spears family history.  Lil' Spears has quite a legacy to live up to.  Being pregers is just the start.

      I swear in every episode thee is a subplot with someone liking someone else but refusing to hang out/date them because of their ruined social image.  I realized this while watching this this weekend (my sisters like the show). <br/> 
Do people really care that much if you hang out with someone who is not as popular as you?  Really?

      I recall hearing that is is notable for it's great degree of drama with constant raping and violence and such. The sort of thing that wouldn't likely be on a TV show in the US aimed at teenagers. <br/>

Not my sort of thing. I never watched any of those type of shows so I don't really have a proper comparison to make.

      Seriously.  The worst of the 80s was settling down by the early nineties, and was finally on its way out by say, 95ish.  My early childhood is full of images of aunts wearing neon-colored jackets, poofy hair, and large, brown thick framed glasses, while sucking down Marlboros and Benson and Hedgeses (100s) and long red nails.  My dad finally shaved his mustache in early '98 and the mullet now only makes brief returns in between haircuts.  I shed my mushroom cut in 4th grade and no longer cuff my jeans, and have not worn a backwards cap with a tuft of hair sticking out of the adjustable band since probably 1996.

      Absolutely. The whole development of American Culture after the 50s fits in pretty well into an analogy -- a high school party. <br/> 
 <br/> 
See, the 50's are the beginning of the party. A lot of the booze hasn't gotten there yet, basically everything there is the host kid's dad's six-pack until somebody shows up with a couple 24 packs or a keg. Everybody who has arrived is still a bit frustrated and tired after their long days at school earlier (World War 2, as the analogy goes). The lack of alcohol is similar to the drug market of the 50's. Cocaine is still available as a stimulant legally, but it isn't nearly as widely used as it is today. Pot is not very common, particularly among young people -- partially due to the fact that in the 50's its quality was terrible. The party is still nice, neat, and tidy. Nobody has knocked over any pictures or barfed on any rugs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, the 60s are the introduction of some of the beer. Some dude has just rolled up in a chevy with 2 cases and now everybody can get started. The music comes on, and everybody is finally starting to have a lot of fun. The bringing of the booze is obviously the introduction of more and more widespread drug use, which at this time is still very rarely regulated. The music industry in the 60s is really starting to explode, and the high numbers of younger people are really starting to cause the demand for new and different music to rise. Unfortunately, as more and more people show up to the party, everyone starts getting less comfortable. Somebody breaks a picture frame or something, and the host gets more than a little pissed (Vietnam). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Well, more people show up, and the keg is finally here. It's the 70's. Now there's more beer than people know what to do with. Everybody had to relish their beer when there wasn't much -- but now it is readily available. People are getting trashed, it is starting to get messy. With everybody drunk, things are starting to get ugly. Maybe a fight or two (the Tet offensive?) has broken out and shit is going down. The beer abundance is the sudden rush in the drug market. The Controlled Substance Act has just passed, and the forbidden fruit is the sweetest. Marijuana is starting to boom in America and cocaine use is at its highest to date. Things (fashion) are starting to get really messy. It is all about being comfortable, because with the spills and messes in the increasingly crowded party it is getting harder and harder to stay content. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The 80's are the messy shit. At this point, people are fucking trashed. There's still more beer, but nobody needs it. Everybody is already good and fucked up. Those fighting assholes got kicked out of the party, so at least  <em>thats</em>  over, but a couple of douchebags are fighting over a chick outside (Iran-Iraq war) and it could get ugly soon. At this point, things (fashion) are just going crazy in the party. People are so wrecked they don't even care what they look like. Coke is fucking everywhere. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The early 90's...well, that's the massive fucking hangover after the party. Everybody just woke up in their 80's clothes, and even though they are filthy and look like idiots, nobody feels good enough to change yet. Fucking hangover.

      I hope you are not thinking of turning this into a term paper. Allow me to be a bit pedantic, please? <br/> 
 The only 'substance' that was not illegal in the 60's was LSD before around 1966 or so, when it got so out of hand in S.F. and L.A.  <br/> 
Beatniks, and regular-looking dudes in the 50's used to go across the border to Mexico and bring back pot. <br/> 
 The Controlled Substance Act just put more teeth into the Federal and State agencies cooperating, etc.   <br/> 
 You could go to jail for life in Texas for possession. <br/> 
The weird thing was the laws would get real tight and restrictive when some political asshole needed a crusade, and then loosen way up later on.  <br/>

      Unless I'm mistaken and thinking of the wrong act didn't the CSA also make it significantly easier to declare a drug illegal merely by moving it's position up a schedule or two? Before then you had to restrict them individually, but now all you have to do is adjust their position on the list.

      It's not so much the early 90s as it was the late 80s. It just carried over a bit. Sort of like how the early 80s also had a lot of late 70s carryover. <br/>

This, however, was distinctively early 90s and not at all 80s. HyperColor was clearly influenced by the late 80s neon craze, but it was definitely early 90s. <br/>

      I fully disagree. The early 90's were awesome for the following reasons: <br/> 
 <br/> 
-People ending their sarcastic comments with "...NOT!" <br/> 
-MTV still playing music videos, some of them actually good. <br/> 
-Beavis & Butthead <br/>

      I don't know. I caught the full force of the early '90s and I remember it as a time of great horror. It was one of those weird points in history during which almost everything sucked. It might have had to do with the fact that at that time I was changing from a cute little boy into a smelly ogre. But the pop music was exceptionally bad, too. And fashion was at an all time low.

      You needed to be listening to something other than pop music....early 90s has some great music. <br/> 
Looking back it was a great time to not be part of the popular crowd, you had options.  Of course at the time we thought it sucked. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Ever notice that 'rock' stations still play a ton of songs from the 90s?  There is a reason for that. <br/> 
Not to mention some of the most influential rap albums of all time came out around that time too. <br/>

      That has been true at every time since the 1960s. That was the last time that pop was acceptable and relevant. I mean, OK, pop in the 80s was either terrible or great depending on your degree of nostalgia and having to suffer through it as an adult, but the alternative scene at that time was just amazing. It still hasn't received quite enough recognition.

Dude, I was, like,  <em>twelve.</em>  Punk rock hadn't changed my life yet.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But for what it's worth, I now realize that there were some good things happening then. Pavement and A Tribe Called Quest are the first things that spring to mind. But that didn't do me much good as a preteen in the rural Midwest. I couldn't exactly run down to the old general store and pick up a copy of  <em>Low End Theory.</em>

      Well yea, pop was always terrible. What I meant was that the heavy music, the stuff that the deviant degenerate kids listened to was Metallica and Suicidal Tendencies. That was shortly before everything went to shit with nu-metal in the mid-90's, and now that place in music is occupied by crap like Avenged Sevenfold and Atreyu.

      As I stated the 60s were the last time that pop was still relevant. In part the Beatles changed that. They worked greater complexity into pop (and also McCartney's crass commercialism) until it wasn't really a genre that could produce much of anything. This also, of course, coincided with the greater development of rock music and its movement away from pop leaving pop a withered shell consisting largely of cheap, bland, crap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The 80s knew how to bring some decent pop, but again, that depends on perspective. I'd say it was the last time that pop music was tolerable, but there was also a lot of really awful crap. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Nowadays it all seems to be either teeny-bopper or hip-hop influenced and pure pop veins have been long mined out. We passed Peak Pop decades ago and it's never coming back.

      Agreed. We used to have things like Iron Maiden where the vocalist actually knew how to sing really damn well not just growl into an effects pedal. Where heavy metal also knew how to soar and deliver some amazing virtuosity not just a series of chugging riffs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Modern metal has fallen to the degree that Metallica is complete crap and Dave Mustaine is a born-again Christian. More people think and care about pop-punk than actual punk.

      I'm a year older than you and I would never have included any of those bands in something I would describe as the best years of my life. <br/>

If anything I'm only more recently realizing how I missed out on Pavement, Mission of Burma, Failure, Hum, Dinosaur Jr. and so many, many other great bands. The terrible modern scene is just an excuse to learn more about the greatness of the past.

      I do not appreciate any of those bands now. (I mean, I might keep an STP song on the radio, if there's nothing else on, but they're not at the tippity top of my list.) <br/>

It's the fact that they're all so different from each other and still all so awkward that makes me happy to look back upon it. <br/>

      Eh, I often don't appreciate those sorts of things if they're really popular at the time. It takes a while for me to be able to enjoy them and see them outside of the media saturation. It's not some sort of "I can't like that because it's popular" so much as it's just so omnipresent that I tune it out and don't really give it a chance. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I only bought "Ten" last year. Oddly, after many years of wondering why the hell I did so only a few years ago I discovered that Soul Asylum, in particular Grave Dancer's Union, actually was pretty good. I guess I just assumed that since I bought it when it came out and I was a lot younger then that I just didn't have any ability to judge that it sucked. I was wrong it appears. It's not great, but it's still better than I gave myself credit for.

      Agreed.  I have listened to better albums than  <em>Ten</em> , a great many, in fact, but it still remains one of my favorites.  There is no replacement for the time in my teens spent in my basement bedroom, reading The Stand and The Dark Tower and listening to  <em>Ten</em>  and  <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> .

      Was there some subtle nuance that I missed in that show? If so, fine. But you realize that, on the surface, it was nothing more than terrible drawings and the same joke over and over and over.

      Are you basically one of those people who were like "omg, it's so stupid, it's just a bunch of immature third-grade jokes"? Because that was precisely the point! When Mr. Anderson says something that could obviously be interpreted sexually, you're not laughing at it directly in the way that Beavis & Butthead are, you're laughing at it in the sense of how obvious it is and you know exactly how they're going to react. It's hard to explain, but it could be put in the same category of "intentionally terrible" as Tim & Eric, or most of Adult Swim.

      I can understand that. It's just that the show ran for a pretty long time and it didn't seem to go very far beyond that type of humor. That, and I can't stand the look of his art. <br/>

I don't know - somehow it was just never a question in my mind as to whether or not I liked it. It was obvious from the get-go. Some things just rub you the wrong way.

      "I don't like stuff that sucks." -  <em>Butthead</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Beavis and Butthead was a zen koan of blissful stupidity.  It challenged a complex world-view by presenting it as seen through the lizard brains of the anti-heroes, who really only wanted nachos, boobs, and MTV.  And even these two idiots were smugly superior to most of the videos on MTV. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Man, I would love a Beavis and Butthead running commentary on most of the MTV programming today.  "She's a spoiled whore.  Huh-huh-huh-huh!" "Yeah! Yeah!  Whores rock!  heeheeheehee!"

      No, not just 'kids are stupid', but I think we all laughed at how happy the kids were to be stupid and their small victories in spite of their crippling stupidity.  Kind of like how it's not just funny that Philippe is naive, but we laugh at the little naive world he lives in.  Yes, I am over analyzing this.  No, I don't know how to dots over the 'i'.  The show was definitely polarizing (my roommate's girlfriend almost broke up with him because he couldn't stop laughing at the poodle in the dryer ( <em>set it on delicate</em> )), but Beavis and Butthead was brilliant.

      Yeah, as long as we're breaking down the B&B, I'm with you.  I don't think the show was trying for a "check out how stupid this show is" vibe.  The only meta thing I took away from B&B was how they pointed out the awfulness of a lot of MTV videos while they were on MTV.

      yea but they pointed out their own stupidity at the same time by saying things like "this video sucks" and then 5 seconds later saying "whoa, that was cool" at like, some chick eating cake or something similarly mundane. B&B was not just about how life is stupid, but how life is absurd. it managed to take an uninteresting and poorly made video and spin it in such a way that the video began to look strange and alluring. that was some  <em>avant-garde</em>  shit.  <br/>

but it was non-meta because the boys were unaware of their stupidity/absurdity.

      Yea you're right. I guess you could say that the show was only one level of meta, in that its implied narrative voice was aware of the characters' stupidity, and expected you to be as well, whereas the other stuff is at least doubly meta, since the narrator AND the characters are self-aware.

      I heard a rumor that the show was originally made as a way to make fun of stoners.  But then, much to the creator's surprise, it became a favorite of stoners.  So he just sucked it up, and kept making it as a show for stoners to watch. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is all rumor, of course.  I have no actual knowledge of the thinking behind the show. <br/>

I never connected with it.  I have probably seen less than an hour total of the show.

      I think kids these days generally suck at video games, with the exception of the ones who are hardcore into PvP games like Starcraft or Soul Calibur. They literally have no idea what it's like to have to memorize every inch of a game and run through it hundreds of times before you even get to the last level, all in one go without saving. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It kind of scares me, but I find myself becoming more like this as time goes on. I have a bunch of old games on my emulator, but the temptation to use save states is just too great. And when I do try running through a Mega Man X game without them, it's a total disaster. I'm actually getting to the point where I cannot remember how I used to play games like this without throwing the controller and quitting.

      Batman: The Animated Series was on in the afternoons and it was so sweet that it significantly impacted the comics and was responsible for the creation and renewed interest in a number of characters. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The X-Men cartoon (which actually was on on Saturdays) was also pretty awesome and while it strayed was fairly accurate in terms of characterization and canon. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Why did Saturday morning cartoons go away? I don't ever see them on anymore.

      Way back in the way back, say 1967, cartoons were  <em>only</em>  aired on Saturday mornings. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Aside from a few kiddie shows on the weekday afternoons that might show two or three shorts left over from the times when you always saw a cartoon at the movies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Later on, in the 70s or so, cartoons started airing on Sundays as well.  With the advent of cable TV, cartoons started to be available in multiple locations at all times of the day. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The ubiquity of cartoons made the Saturday morning thing far less meaningful.  Also, in the 80s, cartoons as unending commercials for toys became the rule, especially on Saturday mornings. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So commercialism and cable TV ruined the underlying premise of Saturday morning cartoons.  They are still around as far as I know, but the environment in which they exist has changed beyond recognition, and they are just no longer important.

      True, but growing up and on into... hmm... early 90's at least, they still existed. I remember each Fall when the new season of Saturday cartoons would come out on each channel and it was a big thing. It only seems like in the late 90's or early 00's that they've gone away. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do recall back in '01 or so they started re-airing the old Dungeons and Dragons show and ABC Family was showing the old X-Men show for a while around '04 or so. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember growing up that Dungeons and Dragons coming on meant that the morning block was ending and it was time for afternoon. It was not particularly good. I also remember that if you got up too early you had to watch fucking Romper Room because it came on before the good cartoon block started and it was total shit.

      Yeah, it was on at, like, 6 AM or something. Watching  <em>Romper Room</em>  was a punishment for waking up too early. According to Wikipedia it ran from 1953-1994. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also have nostalgic memories of  <em>Schoolhouse Rock</em>  which still ran during the early parts of my childhood.

      Oh yeah. The Joel days are a given. Mike was decent, but the show lost a step or two in the transition.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
But here's the weird thing about that; when Joel was acting on the show, Mike was writing most of it. Then when Mike took over the acting, Joel took Mike's place on the writing side. It confuses things a little.

      Bah; say what you will about the Sci-Fi Channel era episodes (they sucked, for the most part), but I still argue that season 6 and the very short season 7, the last two seasons on Comedy Central, and the first two full seasons with Mike at the head of the cast, were probably the two best seasons.  And this is someone who for a while thought that the seasons 2-5 were the best, but I've found that, over time, I prefer watching season 6 & 7 eps.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Rowboat, you're a little misinformed about the "head writer" role on the show: it didn't mean you wrote most of the jokes, it was a little less glorious: Mike's job as head writer was to sit on the computer during the riff sessions and take down the best stuff being thrown out there.  He may have had a bigger influence on it than the other writers, but he wasn't coming up with all the jokes.  Joel, Mike, Trace, Kevin, Frank, Mary Jo, Paul, Jim...all the cast members were writers, and at varying times, there were 1 or 2 non onscreen talent helping out. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If Joel had Manos, then Mike had the whole fucking Coleman Francis trilogy, all in season 6 (Red Zone Cuba, Beast of Yucca Flats, and The Skydivers).  Manos is a train wreck, yeah, but, really, it's not  <em>that</em>  great of an episode; the cast themselves seem kind of stunned by oddity of the movie, and there's a lot of stretches with few or weak jokes; once you've seen it a few times, the novely wears off.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you haven't seen Skydivers, a movie that continues to amaze me in its ineptness (and it's the best of the Francis trilogy!) and really inspired the cast with how horrible it is, you're missing out.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's a good point about Joel's deadpan, hamscout, but I also find that the low joke areas in the Joel eps are actually worse to sit through than the earlier Mike eps, when his general affability kept the mood up a little during the slow times. <br/> 
 <br/> 
holy christ I haven't even watched an episode of this show in 4 or 5 years why am I geeking out so hard.

      I'm actually glad you called me on that, fos. I thought I was probably going out on a limb, what with not having researched it thoroughly, and all. It is true that I don't know what a head writer is. Still, though, Joel has my vote for the on-screen side of things.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I can't believe that no one has mentioned  <em>Mitchell.</em>  Might be my favorite.

      It's a common misconception; I always figured that "head writer" meant he wrote most of the jokes as well, with others chipping in, until I read about it in the Amazing Colossal Episode Guide.  If you haven't gotten that yet, you should; I think it's still in print, actually.  It's really damn funny, as it's written by the show's writers/performers (and a lot more than just an episode guide). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Actually, it may have been reading the ACEG that led me to thinking that Mike, at least in his first few years, was just as good as, maybe better than, Joel.  Mike was really fucking funny, and his writing in the book was probably the best, overall. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't even want to get into the Joel vs. Mike argument (banned on the old MST3K forums on AOL and Prodigy that I used to frequent back in the 90's, ha).  I like them both a lot, and the overall feel of the show was best with Joel, but I've come to realize that most of the 10 or so episodes I used to watch ad nauseum were Mike ep's from seasons 6 & 7. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I'm repeating again that Manos is not the worst film they've done; like they say in the ep guide, it's probably Monster-A-Go-Go.

      Having been around in every decade since the '50s, although I was just a kid then and didn't get to be a beatnik of race tricked out cars while combing my greasy hair, I'd say that since the invention of the transistor radio, everything has been rockin' right along, and each generation picks up the beat.  It's a permanent revolution where youth ingores convention, only to become conventional.

      Hmm... I seem to recall it trying to be a sort of TV version of Ferris Bueller, but not quite succeeding at that while still being amusing. I also now recall that on the first episode he demonstrates how annoying his brother's car alarm is by setting it off with a basketball. How little we knew then what it foretold for the future.

      The funny thing is that the Parker Lewis rip-off of Ferris Bueller was much better than the actual Ferris Bueller T.V. series.  The only funny thing on the latter was when the T.V. Ferris Bueller (Charlie Schlatter) took a chainsaw to a cardboard cutout of Matthew Broderick's Ferris Bueller in the first couple of minutes of the Ferris Bueller pilot.  The rest was terrible. <br/>

Some site says it is the worst song ever made, and they made someone listen to it for 24 hours straight, or something.  I would quite possibly stab my eardrums with a number 2 pencil.  If that doesn't deafen me, if will at least give me lead poisoning, which will dumben me enough to the point where I can actually enjoy the song.

      I think the marking portion of a pencil is now mostly graphite, but I agree with the general idea.  But declaring WBTC as the worst song ever made opens us right up for a discussion of the worst song ever.  I would nominate: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1)  "Nookie" by Limp Bizkit (with Fred Durst also nominated to be among the first non-mass-murdering humans to be launched into the Sun). <br/> 
 <br/> 
2)  Some vaguely R&B-flavored song from a couple of years back with the word "suicide" in the chorus.  (I can't find it online). I don't know what it's called, but it really sounded as if it were written for the retarded.  And poor, poor, retarded people.  What did they ever do to deserve such a song? <br/>

3)  "Imagine" by John Lennon. I know, I know, loads of people like this song to the point that it has become some sort of modern hymn (heh).  But I think it's insipid and inane (these are words with an "i" this time).  Note dear Assetbaristas and Assetbarbarians, that I don't think *you* are insipid and inane for liking it.  I've made peace with being in my own small unconnected circle on the Venn diagram on this one.

      Ringo was the best Beatle in spirit, in mind.  I agree with this.  He had the least ego.  I liked Paul's music the best, I think, though.  I don't know if he was all in it for the money, but so was John, too.  He believed in no possessions, but owned a mansion.  John is the hypocrit.  I think if you are going by who "keeps it real", John loses the contest. <br/>

      There is no doubt that 'Imagine' is at least a little insipid, (I am more of a George man myself), but since a Limp Bizkit song is already on the list, and therefore the band acknowleged, most any other track from their catalogue could knock it off it's third place marker.

      I am really sorta obsessed with the Beatles.  I know that Imagine is not a Beatles song.  That is why I used the Latin prefix "post", meaning "after".  It is one of my favorite post-Beatles Lennon songs. <br/>

John Lennon did some daffy things, but he tried to make a difference.  He did make a difference. <br/>

 And what tekende said about "A Day in the Life"- take that to the bank. Whatever genre that song is, it transcends it. It's like Picasso doing rock.

      The second half of Abbey Road is the best Beatles work.  The best full album is Rubber Soul.  Followed by: <br/> 
 <br/> 
2.  Revolver   <br/> 
3.  Sgt. Pepper <br/> 
4.  Upwards of 70 percent of the White Album. <br/> 
5.  Let it Be <br/> 
6.  Please Please Me <br/> 
7.  With the Beatles <br/> 
 <br/> 
after that, it largely falls out canon for me.  Magical Mystery Tour is not good.  Best Beatles single is Strawberry Fields Forever or Twist and Shout.

      I have something of a minority opinion that  <em>Please Please Me</em>  is the best Beatles album. Why? There is not one bad song on there. Every single one is fun and catchy and  <em>pop</em>  without being stupid. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sure, other albums are technically better; I haven't heard many albums by any band that could beat  <em>Abbey Road</em>  for quality and genius. But  <em>Please Please Me</em>  is and probably always will be my favorite Beatles album.

      I've got your back on this Tekende, there is an argument to be made for Please Please Me.  It all depends on what you think made the Beatles great.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
If it is pop craftsmanship, then you are right.  If it is experimentation with the genre, then they didn't really get started til Pepper, and didn't fully nail it til the end of Abbey Road.  BUT, if you are like me and enjoy a blend of both, then Rubber Soul is your album.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Revolver is amazing, but has a bit to much self-awareness about it.  Rubber Soul feels more genuine and less pretentious to me.  Plus, Rubber Soul doesn't have "Yellow Submarine" on it.  This is, of course, largely a matter of personal taste.

Even now, in the 21st century, I am entranced by its relentless weirdness.  Much less when it came out in 1967.  Yes, that was the Summer of Love and all, but even in that context  <em>MMT</em>  is weird and paradigm-shattering. <br/>

Also,  <em>The Fool on the Hill</em>  is one of the greatest songs ever.  Top 100 all time, easily.

      I shall require the confirmation of one of the older denizens for this, but wasn't the Summer of Love more a creation of the media? The point in time when they noticed that something was going on in the culture and suddenly decided to jump all over it and proclaim it to be the next big thing, but after it had already peaked? The point where the mainstream crashed the party and started commercializing it and ruining it? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Today the Haight is astoundingly gentrified and very popular for shopping. Much of it is fairly pricey, but in that very trendy sort of boho hipster manner. People complain a lot about property values and own some very nice and expensive homes with their BMWs and oh-so-trendy Minis parked out front. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again I hope to be signing the lease on a place just a block north of the Panhandle on Friday. It's nicer and cheaper than the place we live now. Then again I have long hair, a scraggly beard, I wear Birkenstocks and an old fatigue shirt much of the time and I haven't had a job in years. I'm a pacifist and I recently discovered that despite my better wishes I may actually like the Greatful Dead.

      The media creates a lot of things, but I read that the Summer of Love is basically when San Francisco was flooded with college students, etc, for exactly one summer, and then they left for the fall and didn't come back for next summer really, mostly due to the huge upsurge in crime.  This was the summer of love.

I do know several people who were in San Francisco around that time, and they all refer to that year as the Summer of Love. <br/>

      There was an actual Summer of Love, and then the media jumped on it and made it a 'thing'. Which crapped it all up, like you're saying. <br/> 
 I'm thinking Summer 1966, there were all the free concerts in the parks, so-called Love-ins, mass LSD parties, Free Speech mayhem had been going on in Berkeley for some years. Mario Savio.  <br/> 
How the hell I remember his name- isn't that a great name? <br/> 
 S.F. was the hippie Nirvana back then.  <br/>

 By the time I got there in '70, the Haight was gone, more like it is now. Still caught some great free concerts.

      I think part of the problem now is that we still have such a massive influx of street kids there. I mean, yes, we have homeless in the park, but this isn't so much your hardcore homeless like you see downtown as it's a lot of teenage runaways and kids who just wanted to drop out and travel around. I don't want to say that this is the entire population of the Haight homeless, but it definitely skews a lot younger. What I'm basically saying, however, is that the massive influx has never stopped. People still think there's something here. Sometimes there are brief glimpses that there is. Other times you realize that Haight/Ashbury is best known now because that's the intersection where the Ben and Jerry's is and you can buy some skinny jeans over at Villians for $300 and a $50 ironic t-shirt to go with them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It does amaze me that it was a  <em>Summer</em>  of Love. Even in the Haight summer is just too damn cold here. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Last year there was an awesome bandshell up in the Panhandle made out of reused materials. Mainly it was constructed of old car hoods for the shell and plastic water bottles for the back. It only lasted for the summer though and a bit into the fall. I believe they failed to get clearance to leave it up for a few more months and the city made them take it down. People complained that someone had created something unique and cool and made it available for people to put on free performances. They claimed it was an eyesore. This is the modern Haight. I really fucking hate that the yuppie assholes have so much control there now.

      Guys, I think it is time to give the Grateful Dead a break.  They just want you to do drugs and have a good time.  Yes, their 35 minute wankfests suck huge, huge balls.  Get a best-of album or the acoustic album  <em>Reckoning</em> .  Please trust me on this.  Also, exactly as Freaks and Geeks describes it  <em>American Beauty</em>  is one of those albums that can make you see the world a little differently if it comes to you at the right time in your life.

      Since they are no more, it is not possible to go to a Dead show. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And without actually going to a Dead show, it is impossible to get a true understanding of them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This is not to say it is impossible to like them, or to  <em>get</em>  them.  This is to say that they weren't about albums to listen to at home.  They were about the live gig. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you don't appreciate them, that is OK.  But I didn't really connect to them until the outdoor concert where I could steep myself in everything they were about, and why all the people spent years of their lives just following them from show to show.

      I didn't go, and I can't remember exactly which summer it was, but it really happened, SF was flooed with the young and the restless one summer, and it was a street party until the bad drugs and fake hippies showed up.

      Yeah, my understanding was that the 1967 "Summer of Love" was more a creation and branding of the media based on what was already happening before then. Hence the Diggers doing the whole "Death of the Hippie" thing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wasn't alive yet and I don't know anyone who was there, but I want to have a critical eye towards these things. I just know the way our media works and how fragile of a thing it seemingly was. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm also willing to trust Frank Zappa on this one, but then again, he was in LA. Still, the whole "I'll stay a week and get the crabs, and take a bus back home" angle just sounds incredibly likely. Not that there wasn't a real scene before then, but that the specific '67 "Summer of Love" was when it was invaded by the media and the phonies.

      I'm not positive about Cynthia, but I believe he wasn't entirely a good guy, and she and Julian were actually struggling, financially.  The wife of one of the Beatles was struggling. <br/> 
Paul was cool though.  He was more like a father to Julian, although it may be exaggerrated.  I think Julian says so himself that Paul was more of a father than John.

      I always liked that because it was while he was in SF. Of course, the city is not built on rock. It is largely built on sand and landfill. We desperately need to be built on rock. This is really an absolutely terrible place to build a city geologically. Not only is it on an earthquake fault and close to others, but there's very little bedrock here to properly support anything.

      I do not enjoy baseball, but that song never fails to bring back great memories of being a child in the 80s. I have strong nostalgia for it. It also fits into the category of "80s songs strongly enhanced by the use of handclaps" that also includes "Jack and Diane". Actually, they're both roots rock songs as well. Damn. They would go so well together and only came out three years apart.

      I really wanted to like that a lot more than I ended up liking it. I mean, I seriously, deeply wanted to love it. I don't know what happened. Maybe I need to watch it again, but it just felt muddled to me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have similar, but different issues with everything I've ever seen by Satoshi Kon (at least Perfect Blue, Paranoia Agent, and Paprika). They just never end up doing it for me and always feel a bit too muddled for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again I'm the only anime fan I've ever met who dislikes Mononoke Hime. Spirited Away was alright and kinda fun, but I'll never get the gushing praise for Miyazaki. Perhaps it's his opinion on the relationship to nature that doesn't work for me as I tend to come down on the opposite side of that.

      I first saw it on Adult Swim, many years ago.  I thought it was called Judo for some reason.  Eventually I found it after reading Otaku Fanboy Club for three months, when the main female character pulled a guitar out of her head.  I was like, I KNOW THAT and got on the forums. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Found out what it was called, bought the first DVD and loved it.  Bought the second DVD and loved it but wondered which episdoe I saw.  Bought the third DVD, and loved it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The episode I happened to catch first, was the final episode.  You think its fucked up?  Imagine what I thought. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Whever I lend it out now, I give them the final disc and tell them to watch the last episode.  Three months later I lend them the other two and tell them to marathon it.  I have two copies so I don't mind if it is floating around for a while.

      No, this is not an acceptable answer. You despair of how hard it is to find a good fantasy anime, I offer you not only the best fantasy anime but the best anime and possibly the best serial program of all time, and all you can say is you "may eventually see it"? Fie on you, sir. Pfah!

      I've heard some very negative things about it though. I want to give each side an equal say in this. I will move it up to "watch next" status just for you though. That may take some time though. <br/>

It also bothers me how anime draws elves with big, long, floppy ears. These are not proper elf ears. Elves have slightly pointier ears than humans. This is proper. Anime elf ears are not good to me.

      The original film? Does that mean you don't like the sequel? Man, I don't know. I found it a lot better, and not just because it featured more Batou. I've only seen the Laughing Man arc, apart from that, although I'm hoping to borrow Second Gig this Christmas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Cowboy Bebop is awesome too, I agree. Those two are pretty much the only anime I ever watch, apart from the occasional Studio Ghibli. And I still haven't seen Akira.

      No offense, but you are so old!   <br/> 
I know someone who is like 23 who works there.  Maybe even 24.  I don't actually think I know any 26 year olds in real life, though. <br/> 
Senior year of high school I had about 20 friends who worked there, and I wanted to work there so bad because I had a crush on about 5 girls too. <br/> 
Anwer: probably yes.  There had to be some point which I've seen you, even if I was one and you were 7 smiling at the cute baby.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I've always wanted to meet someone online that I know in real life, and I have met you, one person who went to my high school, and one person who now lives in the town  my dad just moved to and may transfer to my school in the same major but I HAVE MET NO ONE YET.

      Hmm... so getting down is the movement towards funk, but getting up is the return to a neutral state so that getting down is possible once again? Interesting interpretation. You might be capable of finally breaking the deadlock.

      I really don't feel like 26 is old, so I'm legitimately not insulted. (Sorry rowboat.) <br/>

When I am 30, if someone says I am old, I will feel sad, because I might actually feel old then.  <br/>

I know what you mean though. I have a little brother who is 18, and whenever I read any of your comments, I think that you are far closer to my age as opposed to someone who could have been friends with him in preschool. I think that just happens to me with everyone here though. Like, I know that Pogo is older, because we make fun of him for it a lot (Hi Pogo!), biff is 47, and scorpio_nadir is 57, and if you read their comments that aren't about stuff from a long time ago, they sort of just seem like they're my age, too. So you know. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Once, when I was 7, I waved at a baby! So we probably did meet. Don't worry!

These older guys, by the way, are odd to me, because I'm simply not used to middle aged people on the Internet.  But they do seem pretty cool, even though I keep getting cosmically slapped.

      Not entirely. It is a distinct style of rock music before things started to splinter heavily. It's more like "Coke Classic": the way things were before they became "New". It has no comment on quality and new classic rock is definitely possible.

      Dude I had Pepsi last night for the first time in a few months or so and I wanted to rip my tongue out and stick it in a urinal just to get that putrid syrup out of my taste buds, then I wanted to rip my brain out and slam it between two cinder blocks in the hopes that my hippocampus would be damaged at least short-term so I wouldn't remember the taste.

      The way I always saw it, in order to be considered part of Generation X, you had to at least have been old enough to appreciate Nirvana in their own time. I was 7 and had just come to America when Nevermind came out, so I missed that boat by a few years.

      Let me give you my frame of reference: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1994 was Kindergarten for me (I was 4 but I was born in November so I consider myself 5 at the time; us late-year birthday-havers do that a lot) <br/> 
2001 I was age 11/12 (I say this because 9/11 was a defining moment for this decade and by extension the generation) <br/> 
I was 6 when we got our first computer, which was on of those blue screen mono-functional things, with video games on floppy discs. <br/> 
Age 7 we got a better computer and the Internet later that year. <br/> 
And I am 19 now, as of 6 days ago. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I can give culturally significant stuff if you want another frame of reference.

      You are so hard Gen Y. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I remember sitting in the kitchen watching TV when the Challenger blew up even though I was only in Kindergarten at the time. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you grew up in the 90s you are Gen Y. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Those of us who grew up in the 80s are a bit trickier. Some fall on either side of the line depending on how late into the decade you were born. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2001 I was in college. I woke up kinda late and the whole thing was all over the news and my girlfriend came in told me to turn on the TV so I did and I saw what was going on and I turned off the TV and rolled over and went back to sleep. I mean, what could I do about it? I knew what was going on, but that's not going to get in the way of sleeping.

For me, it was a bit harder to ignore because I had the lovely image of the towers on fire from my window and the cloud of smoke for weeks afterward.  Also the jets flying by overhead kind of made a lot of noise.

      I think I was in 3rd or 4th grade when the Challenger bit it. The only emotion I remember was complete joy because we got to go home early. Death didn't mean much to me then. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In '01 I watched it unfold all morning. I was effected, but it was like I was watching a movie or something. I was also waiting for word that my classes for the day would be cancelled. I did not receive word. I went to my class. After everyone had arrived and had taken their seats, our professor walked in and told us all to go home. I was pissed about the inconvenience. Death didn't mean much to me then. <br/>

I'm not completely sure, but I  <em>think</em>  death means more to me now. I guess I'll find out eventually.

      I have said this before, so I am probably being a douche by repeating it, but... <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was at work when the Challenger blew up.  I was waiting for my 2PM shift to start on the Ground Navigation Console in the Mission Control Center.  It kinda put a damper on the next few years for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was working in Houston on 9/11, just a block or so from the tallest building in the city.  We were all kind of paranoid.  My boss told us at 10:30 that we could leave early if we wanted to, but we would have to use sick time or vacation time.  Then at 11:00 they sent us all home. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I was born in 1962, still by definition a baby boomer.  I know, WWII had been over for 17 years, but I am still a baby boomer by definition. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And really that's kind of true.  I have more in common socially and culturally with people fifteen years older than me than I do with people five years younger. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But, no matter what generation you call it, I have always been a misfit.

      One of my fellow navigators was married to a woman who was on the investigation team.  So he got a look at the accident report right when it came out, and brought it and the video to work so we could all see and read it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This was not the political  <em>How could we have let this happen?</em>  investigation that was all over TV forever.  This was the engineering  <em>What were the physical causes?</em>  internal investigation report that just reviewed what had happened. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Really though, I could go on for pages and pages about this, and this really isn't the place. <br/>

      Effected or affected? I do not see how you could be effected by it. This confuses me, but I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think part of it is that people have been trying to fuck with the WTC for a long time now. The other part is, well, when you see it on the news there is a strong element of "this is something that has already happened" so there isn't really anything I can do in response. I became informed that it happened. What else could I have done?

      Exactly. The towers were hit by planes. They are falling down and on fire. We don't know anything else at this time. That was really all there was to report when I turned it on. It was like, five or ten minutes of information. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I found it interesting that people immediately started talking about Osama Bin Laden being behind it when there was nothing to suggest that. It just seemed like they said that because they were familiar with the name due to it being on the news the most recently. I initially was willing to suspect domestic terrorism. I wonder how that would have been different. I wonder how things may have been worse over the past decade if that was the case, I wonder how they may have been better.

      I was in second grade when 9/11 happened (age 8-9 for all you Non-'Mericuns), and when the teacher heard something happened, she just let us watch old Mickey Mouse tapes until our parents picked us up. We were just happy to have basically a half-day, and we just goofed around and played Classroom Survivor (last one to get picked up by their parents wins!), cheering when someone's parents came and made our winning chances better. I only found out what happend in the car on the way home, but I only cared in an "aw, that sorta sucks" kinda way. When we got home, we called our dad, (who worked in the city, but not near the towers, thank goodness), who just got annoyed that we interrupted him at work. When I saw it on TV, my thoughts were more along the lines of "huh. How 'bout them apples" than "I can't believe how devastating this is". So really, it didn't really affect me at all. Nowadays, I just think of it as a pretty terrible and sucky thing that happened, but no reason to live in fear or go all over-patriotic "to show them ay-rab ter'rists" <br/>

      Pretty much 9/11 didn't affect many lives significantly if you didn't have any relatives/didn't live in one of the cities.  That didn't change the amount of terrible essays written about it for "The Day That Most Change My Life" in high school.   <br/>

      God damn god damn, second grade? That was my senior year of high school. Wow. <br/> 
 <br/> 
We were in the middle of philosophy class, and some secretary came in to tell us that a plane had flown into the WTC and that's all they knew so far. Most of us imagined some kind of little crop duster or 2-seater that had spun out of control. So we kept talking about Wittgenstein for another 15 minutes, and then she came back and told us that one tower had fallen and it was terrorism. Everyone got herded into the classrooms with TVs and we watched the news coverage. Eventually people started getting bored of watching the same clip over and over and just hearing them repeat that they didn't know anything, so everyone started talking and my friend and I started playing games on one of the computers in the back, while the teacher was trying to make us pay attention by saying that this was our generation's Pearl Harbor. But it was precisely because it was such a huge event and because of the magnitude of the media coverage that it didn't seem real but more like a movie. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I should note that this was in New Jersey about 20 minutes outside of NYC. Almost everyone's parents worked in the city, and our whole senior class had internships there, including many in the WTC, which were due to start on Wednesday, Sept. 12, i.e.  <em>the next fucking day</em> . But amazingly, there was no widespread panic, though a good number of people lined up in the office to call their parents. The only person I remember being affected in our entire class was one girl whose family friend died. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Afterwards, I did have a brief surge of 'patriotism' and thought that people who opposed the war in Afghanistan were retarded. It was only when all of a sudden we started talking about invading Iraq that I was like "wait, wtf does Iraq have to do with any of this?"

      Samesies on the whole uberpatriotism shit.  I was off my cookie with These Colors Don't Run and shit but I was sure to let everyone know how I didn't blame all Muslims because like 1/4 of my school was Middle Eastern/Arab; it was a weird time for me.  My dad still can't watch video of the towers and I get a little annoyed at him for always being more than a little sensitive about it but it's different for both of us.

      Hmm... I never really understood the uberpatriotism angle. I was more of a "Hey, why did someone do this? Can we maybe talk to them so they don't want to do it anymore? Were we colossal dicks? Is this something we can fix?" and everyone else was like "Let's get crazy revenge now because we feel angry!". That's what Afghanistan felt like to me. Just mindlessly lashing out at something because we're big and angry and wanted to be able to attack someone to make ourselves feel better. Because otherwise we'd just have to sit there and take it and admit that there's not really much we can do aside from long, slow processes that might have an actual impact. <br/>

      I too was in my last year of highschool, it was actually kinda creepy, my first period Literature teacher often opened up homeroom with a recounting of her dreams, before we got the news she was talking about how she couldn't sleep at all because she kept dreaming about wailing sirens... we didn't think too much of it, the week before it was something about a flock of talking hummingbirds, the actual news didn't reach us until 2nd period physics.

      We were talking about Columbine in my Senior year AP US Government class not long after it happened when suddenly the alarms all went off. It was freaky. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Some douche called in a very amateur bomb threat and we all got herded outside. A teacher snapped at me to put away my umbrella which I thoughtfully always carry in my backpack because I might be hit by lightening or something. This is crazy. It was raining. What kind of idiot is this? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I only lived a couple blocks from school, but they made us all go down the block to a nearby middle school until we were picked up or, eventually, they took us over to the parking lot in small groups to check out our cars and let us go. I had a bunch of large boxes in the hatch and a lone, somewhat sinister briefcase in the back seat because of debate. I was inspected a bit more because of this, but not overly sinisterly. <br/>

      The night before the Oklahoma City bombing, I stayed up late in the lobby of my college dorm, talking with a couple friends who were History freaks.  We were talking about the ramifications of a bomb that would take out most of the government (and the rules that keep someone out of the chambers for just such an instance).  I asked them if they thought someone might try something as big as a bomb, and they pretty much agreed it was just a matter of  <em>when</em> . <br/>

On 9/11, I was out of college, and in the second year of my first full-time job.   <br/> 
A couple of us watched the coverage on a TV in a conference room. <br/>

September 11th didn't seem like a big deal to me.  Seventh grade, and my mom (who worked in teh cafetaria) told me hours before anyone else new.

      I was always sensitive to "not caring" about that for a while after 9/11 because it was close to home for me, physically and emotionally or whatever (lots of relative firefighters and cops, National Guardsman neighbor-friend, etc.), and today while I think of myself as being able to handle controversial humor (racism, whathaveyou), I still can't stand when people make fun of 9/11, like the "I'm falling for you" thing on 4chan.  Makes my blood boil.  But we're all allowed a bit of irrational defensiveness.

      Part of it really scared the fuck out of me. <br/>

When I was in high school there was a lot of talk about the "War Window."  That was the time when it would be most advantageous to the USSR to actually start a war.  And it was the three years right after I graduated from high school. <br/>

Also, that was the time when they reinstated Selective Service.  It was during my senior year that I had to go to the post office and register. <br/>

Several of us got really stoned, and then went in to sign up.  That was a weird feeling.  And not just because I was stoned.  I remember feeling like I was signing my life away, that things were suddenly totally out of my hands.

      I can't believe Carter brought it back. That was probably the worst thing he did in office. I mean, everything else he did seemed to generally be made because he felt like it was the right thing to do even if it didn't always work out or it was unpopular he seems to have been a fairly reasonable person who actually had real morals and tried to act in line with them for the betterment of the country. That was just a cheap ploy to appear tough in order to beat Reagan. <br/>

Selective service is just... it's completely unethical.

      Carter is kind of a conundrum.  He is probably the only president of my lifetime with any honesty and integrity.  Yes so much that happened while he was in office went so wrong. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Selective Service thing has so far been rather benign.  No one has been forced into military service at all, much less sent to war because of it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Selective Service doesn't compare in any way to Carter's mishandling of the economy and foreign affairs in such a way that it led to eight years of Ronald Fucking Reagan. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll take Selective Service any day.

      Indeed. New Coke was actually designed to be Diet Coke (which uses a different formula), but with actual sugar and a few other minor changes to get it to taste right. The thought was that it tasted closer to Pepsi at the time and would be more successful in competing directly. It was not. People realized that Diet Coke is complete shit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Diet Pepsi is even worse though. That Coke Zero stuff actually tastes a lot like regular Coke though. I've been drinking Pepsi One for a while now though since I switched to diet soda to lose a bit of weight. I can't wait to go back, but after some impressive gains about two years ago I've had some minor fluctuations and never really made it down to my goal of 140 lbs. so I'm still drinking this vile diet soda. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Diet Mt. Dew, oddly enough, tastes a lot like regular Mt. Dew. I have both in the fridge and it's really very uncanny.

Try not drinking soda at all to lose weight.  I can't say I've lost much weight in the past 3 months, but I haven't drank more than a few cups of soda in that time.  Although I do drink pink lemonade three meals a day, and I don't know what that does to me.  I should probably lay off that.

I wish to god I was making that up. Of course I was laughing my ass off about it for, like, a month afterward, but it really is kind of depressing if you think about it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I haven't been to Taco Bell in over a year. That is because the last time I ate there I bit down on something so hard I thought I broke a tooth. In my extremely stoned state, I somehow immediately convinced myself that it was, of all things, a baby's tooth. I've never been able to shake the dread that this fake idea caused me.

      Hey man, if a fiesta was the main ingredient of anything I'd eat it.  And as a contrasting thing to your thing, I have been to Taco Bell way too much this semester.  Actually last time I was there it took over 30 minutes for my friend to get his big box meal and afterwards (fuck afterwards isn't a word) I extolled the virtues of having Latino workers as opposed to white workers, like this particular establishment had.  I can say things like this because I'm 1/8th Mexican.

      I rarely, if ever, go to Taco Bell anymore. It's just not common around here and in the city you don't really have drive-throughs except in rare cases. This also means that the few that are around aren't open late or they're hard to get to. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Instead we have to go to local taquerias and get delicious mexican food made by mexicans for about the same price you'd pay at Taco Bell. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They don't have Baja Blast, but they do have Jarritos and Horchata and Agua Frescas. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Still, I sometimes miss the days of suburban Taco Bell. I don't know why though.

      Sometimes I find that I miss the chains a bit. If only because it was something I grew up around. I don't want to lose the great local places, but it feels odd to know that the chains aren't there at all unless you drive all the way out to suburbs.

      It probably was a baby's tooth. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I was having a house party and asked my roomate what he wanted to eat.  "Get me some tacobell."  I am in the drive-thru (sic) and the guy asks what I want. <br/> 
 <br/> 
"Could I uh... could I get some Taco Bell?" <br/> 
 <br/> 
We all basically just laughed the whole time, making the most vague requests.  The dude I gave my money to was about red in the face, with a joyous smile.  We left with a crunchwrap supereme, two grilled stuft burritos, and ten soft tacos.  I didn't order anything other than, "meat cheese and vegetables, in a tortilla."

      I had to check Wikipedia because I wasn't even aware of it until 2005 or so when they re-launched it. That Pepsi Max stuff, in the US at least, is terrible though. <br/>

      I don't know if they are shoved down our throats more than otherwise.  I mean, they do have a Guitar Hero dedicated to them. <br/> 
Mostly I hate their look and their . . .well, sound.   <br/> 
They have a place on Winnepasaukee(sp?), and I guess my father's friend used to hire them to play concerts at his house there.  That's pretty intense, though.  I'll probably ask them to play  <em>Come Together</em>  and then pay them to leave.

      My feelings exactly.  If I hear "Hot Legs" or "If Ya Think I'm Sexy" I start projectile vomiting pure hatred, and yet I just downloaded "Stay With Me" two days ago and I've already listened to it 8 times.

Sorry, I love it.  I regret how that affects your life.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Here's the story: I was in American Eagle with a more fashion-conscious friend, standing in a corner and lamenting at the 9 year old preps with faux hawks, when the opening strains of that song came across the PA/TV on the wall.  The mariachi's brass came in, and I whipped my head at the TV.  I was hooked from the first time I heard it.  It's what saved me from stabbing myself in the eye with a hanger in that store that day...

      Fuck. They play that at American Eagle? Now it's ruined for me and I loved that song. <br/>

Also are you saying it's fashion conscious to be at American Eagle?!? If so I wish to direct you to searing pain. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I bought a few things from them back in '96 or so. I got two t-shirts that don't have logos on them anywhere (technically they do, but they're a faint grey and about 2 x 3 cm and you have to look really hard to see them) and some cargo pants with four cargo pockets that are a fucking modern marvel because having more pockets is fucking important (people with pants with superfluous or unusable pockets are douches, I use mine). <br/> 
 <br/> 
From about '95 or so until '05 or '06 I did not wear jeans ever. I did not own a single pair. Why did the douchebags have to ruin cargo pants and make them into a Thing? A stupid thing filled with distressed pants and idiotic pockets that cannot be used and such. I hates them so much.

      <em>Pattern Recognition</em> , aside from just being good, had some interesting commentary on branding on clothes and such. The idea of Levi 501s with all of the branding removed seemed like just such an astoundingly  <em>correct</em>  idea to me. I prefer the relaxed fit, but still....

      Lots of people hated that book.  They felt that Gibson was somehow betraying his audience by writing a weak book, not really set in the future, and lacking all the interwoven storylines his previous works were noted for. <br/>

      True, it was... different, but I enjoyed it. I think that Spook Country has shown where he might be going with this new trilogy though. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think he has a point about the future being now, but that also sounds, well... a bit like he's being an old man about it. I think he could go a bit further in trying to tie those ideas into the earlier cyberpunk works and show how things have come to pass in a more subversive, subtle way, but the future really did turn out like that and it keeps going even further in that direction. I think he did a bit of that, but not entirely enough. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If we see the Bridge Trilogy as being both about the literal bridge as well as a metaphorical bridge between the present and the future and the Sprawl Trilogy and the Blue Ant Trilogy then I think it starts to take better shape. He has been steadily moving from near future to nearer future back into the present his whole career. <br/>

      Those are both great. After that do  <em>Cryptonomicon</em>  which is good, but it's longer and starts to move away from cyberpunk into his more recent modern/historical focus. It also has the same lengthy "I'm now going to break from the narrative and explain a ton of things in a very pedantic sort of way" which is cool because I enjoy learning it, but it disrupts the narrative flow and it's very much like being pulled aside for a lecture on Sumerian myth or Turing Machines or Van Eck phreaking.

      Agreed. I just don't like wearing clothes with brand logos on them. It's completely silly to pay $70 for a little moose sewn to the corner or of your shirt! I mean, the only time I went there was because I got a gift card and needed a pair of jeans. And truly, it was an unpleasant place. Everything reeked of perfume, they had pictures of half-naked people making out on every wall, the music was loud and unbearable, even after using the $50 gift card, the jeans still cost $30, which is more than I would normally pay for jeans anyway, and I never wear the jeans because they are scratchy, fit oddly, and I can't bend the slightest bit without showing off my asscrack. I have never been so frustrated with a clothing store. I do not understand 1)why so many girls I know are so in love with Abercrombie, and 2)what kind of parent lets their kid spend 40 bucks on just a thin t-shirt with a moose on the front?  <br/>

Otherwise you are not even remotely wrong. I cannot imagine buying clothes there. I don't recall them being nearly so loud and bad back in '95 though. They weren't really good then, but you could find some basic things there occasionally.

      Did you get the operating system shirt for free?  To me, that is a fair trade-off.  They give me a free shirt, and in return I advertise for them. <br/>

Alternatively, do you have strong positive feelings about that operation system?  Do you feel like using it will enhance the experience of others?  To me, that is another justifiable reason to wear the logo on a shirt. <br/>

      Actually, no, I'm just wearing a "got root?" shirt right now because it was clean and I got it back in college. <br/>

I do, however, have a Red Hat shirt I got for free, but I rarely wear it. I don't want to promote Red Hat and would not use it myself. It's also ugly and in terrible condition. <br/>

I have, however, turned down other free shirts since then. I don't see the need to own ugly things I'll never want to wear.

      Very true. I moved back to jeans recently and have found that despite not having enough pocket space (I keep my wallet in my front pocket, always have... I don't use the back pockets) they go well with a lot of clothes. A pair of dark blue jeans and a casual white cotton button-down shirt is a nice look that is very versatile and timeless.

      I disagree. There is sexual preference as a means to identify the type of sex that you prefer and then there is the sexual act itself. I think both are relevant. <br/>

In this case I believe we are discussing gay-for-pay scenarios.

I would make an analogy here, but that would be hypocritical of my earlier comment on how analogies are stupid.

      I think some of it can perhaps be determined behavioristically by the manner in which they act in the scene in question. This is likely not a perfect means, but I'm sure we can at least get some good evidence of some that are only doing it for the money from this. <br/>

      I agree. The statistics on this would definitely interest me. I'm sure there is a small number. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The problem is that so much is moving online and we're getting a lot more... well, amateur isn't correct at all, but people who maybe shoot a few videos or maybe only one for the cash one time and don't do anything more. People who are not in the industry as a career. A lot of people try to fake this, but it also seems like there is a fair degree of it out there legitimately. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I suspect that such as Abby Winters might have some actual lesbians, but that might just all be marketing.

      Well, I think most are probably just bisexual if anything. I doubt there are very many actual lesbians working in porn. There may be a few, but I suspect it's the minority. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have often wondered what sort of porn most lesbians are interested in. I mean, most "lesbian" porn is aimed at a straight male audience. Actually, I have some basic ideas, but that's just as simple as going in to Good Vibrations and checking out the selection.

      Right now I'm trying to decide if I legitimately like HaHa the Moose and Ratatat or just some songs, or if I want to like them for the novelty factor.  I usually give it a while, youtube them, then download a few songs, then decide.  Sometimes I get an album and decide I don't like a band but I thought I did from the snippets of songs on Amazon or Myspace, like And The Moneynotes, who are basically a one-trick pony, but sometimes that happens then the band matures a million times over in a year's time and release an amazing follow up and I re-like the band (Dr. Dog).  Then there are bands I just love the minute I hear them (Delta Spirit, opened for Dr. Dog at a show I went to).  So there are varying degrees of like and the means of getting there and WHO CARES BESIDES ME NO ONE.

      I wouldn't call it immature, but "We All Belong" was my intro to them and seemed very monotonous.  "Fate" was absolutely GODLY.  It completely reversed my opinion on the band and made me go back and listen to "WAB" again and now I appreciate it a bit more; I still don't listen to the whole thing.

      I think it's because they suck. I liked them in middle school, but that was just around the time that Get a Grip came out and they were riding out the end of their late 80s Permanent Vacation/Pump comeback. If you like them past middle school you have problems. Or it's the 1970s. I can see how they could be appreciated in their time and place. They are not good now though.

Led Zeppelin <br/> 
Aerosmith <br/>

Pink Floyd (no really, enough obsessing, 14 year old stoners) <br/> 
Metallica <br/> 
Van Halen <br/> 
Black Sabbath <br/>

      Jack Palance is a dead actor.  He died two years ago, at age 87. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Even in the 1990s, when he was in his 70s, many women thought of him as sexy.  So much so that he did commercials for some cologne or other. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the tag line for the commercials was, "Confidence is always sexy." <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not so much that they don't like you because they know you like them.  It's that they are turned off by the fact that they can tell that you care if they like you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If they think you don't care, that makes you much more attractive to them.  If they think you care, it makes you seem needy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
God, listen to me giving advice as if I knew what I was talking about.  Well, I have been married twice, so I have  <strike>fooled</strike>  convinced at least two women that I was worth their time.

      I wasn't purposely trying to bait you (I honestly forgot with whom the argument was), and I wasn't calling every Floyd fan a 14 year old stoner, just that 14 year old stoners usually like them.   <br/>

Don't look for an argument out of me because I don't ever want to have one with people online or in real life ever ever ever.  We smokem peace pipe right here right now or you can just add me to your ignore list.

But yes, if you don't want to get into an argument, you should avoid saying  <em>any band*</em>  is only appreciated by 14-year-old stoners.  Because no matter how crappy you think the band is, someone out there will be a fan, and feel insulted. <br/>

      i never went through a classic rock phase. i went right from shitty nu-metal to the major indie rock "training bra" bands, as my friend used to say (pixies, sonic youth, my bloody valentine). i just missed all those bands completely, and now, at twenty years of age, i love rocking out to led zeppelin, completely without irony.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
basically, i think you're after the wrong thing here...what gets my goat is people my age, born after the Reagan era for fuck's sake, who still think "classic rock" is the only good music that was ever made. that shit is just ignorant. those people are the lame fourteen year old stoners you're thinking of, getting really into and essentially co-opting the pop culture experience that belongs to a previous generation. in reality, all of those bands have produced material that is Okay to enjoy on some level. in my opinion. <br/> 
 <br/> 
then again, rod stewart's greatest hits collection was one of the first cassettes i owned, and i love "do ya think i'm sexy?" so. <br/>

      That's actually a pretty good list. I mean even if a given band doesn't start sucking like Metallica did, don't you just get tired of being obsessed with the same band for years and years, going on about them, buying and wearing their t-shirts, attending their shows, etc? I wouldn't go so far as to say you  <em>shouldn't</em>  listen to them, but yea, if I meet someone in their late 20's who conspicuously advertises himself as a Metallica fan, something's just not right. It's like "well, duh, but don't you listen to anything  <em>else</em> ?"

      I think there's a difference between being obsessed with a band and still enjoying their music. <br/> 
 <br/> 
This, at least the previous list, seemed to imply that there is a shelf life during which you can enjoy certain things before you have to admit that they are silly and you were wrong to like them. In my mind you should never like shitty things and if something was good it is still good. There are, of course, lapses and changes, but saying that "Metallica is something that only a middle schooler should like because they do not know better yet"... that's not something I can agree with and I get hell of complaints about being a musical elitist.

You do not get to put Led Zeppelin on that list. Or Pink Floyd (obsessive fans are one thing, but that's not enough to deserve it), or early, good Metallica, or Sabbath. <br/>

If you can find something that rocks harder than "Panama" well, I'd like to fucking see it. That is quite possibly one of the best songs ever written about partying (even if it is not, technically, about partying, as a song partying is what it is about)). <br/>

      Odyssey game console, released in 1972.  You could play different paddle games! <br/> 
 <br/> 
And the first game console I had available to me was a Heath Kit console that my granddad built in 1977.   <em>It had three different games on it!!!</em>   You could play  <em>player versus player</em> , or  <em>player versus game!!!</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't play another game console until the 90s when my step kids brought a Nintendo with them to the marriage.  They later got a Nintendo 64 or SuperNES or whatever it was that their dad's mom bought them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I never played them much.  Such games require manual dexterity, and I am severely lacking in that department.

      "Tits 2: Hypertits is the sequel of the science fiction/horror movie Tits. Released in 2002, Hypertits had a bigger budget than its predecessor, and a new director, Andrzej Seku%u0142a. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The industrial-style tits of the first movie are replaced with high-tech, brightly-lit chambers; the plausible technology of the tits %u2014 flamethrowers and extending spikes %u2014 are replaced with floating objects with razor-sharp blades and translucent walls that decompose matter. The Tits Rooms, that the main Tits is composed of, are not separate entities that move but simply the same Tits in different times. Different chambers inside the titteract also distort gravity, time and space, leading to alternate realities." <br/> 
 <br/> 
So I'm pretty sure Hypertits had nothing to do with color. They took that motif out.

      Ladies, do your breasts grow and shrink and size?  Have you previously attributed this behavior to diet, water retention, or your monthly cycle?  Ladies, you may have HyperTits.  Your boobs are not changing in size but actually jiggling in the 4th dimension.  In our primitive 3-D perception, we experience this  motion as a mysterious oscillation in size.  For even and comfortable support of your HyperTits across  <strong>all</strong>  spatial dimensions, try the HyperBra with tesseract cup technology.

      I do not know. I have no desire to visit Philadelphia. I have relatives that live in the suburbs there and now some friends of mine since high school just moved to the area, but I have no desire to ever go there again. Actually, I desire a cheese steak right now, but that's it. Oh and a soft pretzel. And maybe a knish, but that's not so much a Philadelphia thing.

      Regional foods bother me. It is like someone is oppressing me somehow by keeping it all to themselves. I am filled with an odd sort of rage by it. They need to make these things widely available to me as well. I mean, Chipotle has brought SF-style burritos to everyone else even if they're a watered-down version that is grossly inferior to even the more mediocre local taquerias. Except we all deserve to have good versions of these things. Equality and unity through delicious foodstuffs people. <br/>

      Yes and I do not think it is still in production. That might not have been in the zine though, but visiting abandoned mental asylums definitely was. She did an internship with Troma one summer and made the existential zombie film "Amid the Dead" (which I believe is free up on Archive.org). <br/> 
 <br/> 
The zine itself was only about three or four issues. The sort of thing you do in college. <br/>

"The path of the raper is beset on all sides by the inequities of the raped and the tyranny of rape enablers. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the raped through the valley of the rapeness, for he is truly his brother's raper and the raper of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great rapance and furious rape those who attempt to rape and sodomize my brothers. And you will know my name is Rapey McGee when I lay my peepee upon thee. And I will execute great bukkake upon them with furious nonconsensual sex; and they shall know that I am THERAPIST, when I shall thrust my junk into thee." I been saying that shit for years. And if you heard it, that meant your ass. I never gave much thought to what it meant. I just thought it was some cold-blooded rapage to say to a motherraper before I raped a raped in his rape. But I saw some rape this morning made me think about rape . .. TWICE. See, now I'm thinking, maybe it means you're the evil raper, and I'm the cherry rapee. And Mr. 9mm here, he's the chastity belt protecting my righteous hymen in the chasm of pinkness. Or, it could mean you're the child and I'm the trusted priest and it's the world that's prudish and evil. I'd hit that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the slave.

      You might not believe this, but I actually posted that independently. I decided to stop reading the last strip's comments after the argument got way out of hand because I had shit to do and I realized that Biff was basically copy/pasting the same two sentences without bothering to respond to any specific points anyone brought up against him. I didn't even see the feminist argument break out, which I am glad for. <br/>

      To rape, or not to rape--that is the question:  <br/> 
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer  <br/> 
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune  <br/> 
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles  <br/> 
And by opposing end them. To die, to rape--  <br/> 
No more--and by a rape to say we end  <br/> 
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks  <br/> 
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  <br/> 
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to rape--  <br/> 
To rape--perchance to cum: ay, there's the rub,  <br/> 
For in that rape of death what dreams may come  <br/> 
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,  <br/> 
Must give us pause. There's the respect  <br/> 
That makes calamity of so long life.  <br/> 
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,  <br/> 
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely  <br/> 
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,  <br/> 
The insolence of office, and the spurns  <br/> 
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,  <br/> 
When he himself might his quietus take  <br/> 
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,  <br/> 
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,  <br/> 
But that the dread of something after death,  <br/> 
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn  <br/> 
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,  <br/> 
And makes us rather bear those ills we have  <br/> 
Than fly to others that we know not of?  <br/> 
Thus conscience does make rapists of us all,  <br/> 
And thus the native hue of resolution  <br/> 
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of cocks,  <br/> 
And enterprise of great pitch and moment  <br/> 
With this regard their currents turn awry  <br/> 
And lose the name erection. -- Soft you now,  <br/> 
The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons  <br/> 
Be all my sins remembered.

      That sounds a lot like watching Fourth of July fireworks here. I shit you not. It is fucking freezing cold on the Fourth. If you do not bring warm drinks and heavy blankets you will freeze your ass off. <br/>

      San Francisco. Summer is the coldest season here because the warm air from inland comes out and hits the cold air coming in from the ocean and we get covered in tremendous amounts of fog. Considering that the cold ocean air also keeps it rather chilly here much of the time to begin with when we lose the sun we also lose almost all of our heat. There are occasional nice days in the summer, but it's not common. People still run the heat during the summer. They also complain if it goes up to 76 F because they can't deal with such a heat wave. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Considering that the city fireworks are down at the waterfront (although it's on the bay side of the penninsula, not the ocean side so it's a little bit better) it's extra-cold there.

      He did not say it though. Everyone else constantly does, however. I was afraid someone would repeat that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In  <em>Roughing It</em>  Twain says rather complimentary things about the climate here. I find it a bit odd, but perhaps it was more agreeable to him and in the days before air conditioning I can see how people might not care for very warm weather though I personally love it. I do not want the temperature to ever go below 70. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I do not want to live in LA though. This is the conundrum. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It also bear mentioning that although we are surrounded by ocean it is never warm enough to go in the water, the beaches suck, and the water is murky and filled with dangerous rip tides. All the shipping moved to Oakland and we don't have much in the way of commercial fishing these days either if I am understanding correctly. The ocean is basically just a source of pain for me. I want to go down to the pier and buy fresh fish from some guy getting it off his boat. Why is that so much to ask?

      While those are awesome things to be certain, can you not have that and also be shooting your load in her ass? Maybe afterwards you could play video games. <br/>

Maybe it is just the women you are dating though. Maybe you should be meeting women in other ways. Sadly I do not know the way to find a hot Asian girl who rocks on the bass and owns a Street Fighter II cabinet. If I did I would probably not tell you until I had availed myself of the same. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Perhaps there is a local college with an anime club or such? Would be good way to meet ladies who share interests. Or some other group. I do not generally know how to meet people even for friends. I have made perhaps one friend in the past five years. I just don't know how people do it.

maybe, on the internet? chicks in anime clubs are not the cool kind of nerd-chicks. they are generally socially awkward, sometimes with homely or chubby thrown in. they are not witty, just ripe with anime trivia and quotes. i am speaking only from experience (my high school anime club), THIS IS NOT ALL GIRLS AT ALL ANIME CLUBS OK GEEZ.  <br/>

i'm not good at making new friends either. that is, i have a hard time finding people i deem cool enough to be my friend. i am so hard up for cool chick friends i cry at night sometimes just thinking about it. i need to get over the fact that most chicks are just not as awesome as me.

      The problem with the Internet is that while there is a greater pool to meet people from the same reason that is possible also makes it more likely that they are not local people with which you can become more physical friends with. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Such as with Assetbar. There are many cool people here, but to find them all we had to pull people from around the world to find this concentration of coolness. Reduce the sample size and you're back to square one. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I realize there are problems with clubs and groups, but it seems like an easier way to meet people in meat space that are not just there to look for people to have sex with and also to find those who share your interests.

Hey-o? I'm sorry, I can't actually give you a heartfelt hey-o because this is a problem for me too. I can't exactly be too picky with friends at a new school where I know basically no one, so I just try to be friendly and hope for the best. But geez, it is hella hard finding nerdy-ish girls in my grade. I mean, there are gals who get good grades, but... I dunno how to explain it... they don't actively want to learn on their own? Actually, I think that's a good way to explain it. I can forget about learning interesting things from them, and they don't really read a lot on their own, from what I know (I would read a ton more had I the time), except whatever's popular right now, which is Twilight because 'OMFG eDwRd CulLnz soo HOTT!' (Good to know that I can write a popular teen series just by describing the main character as 'super-hot'). Actually, odd story by the way, I had to explain to two girls what sodomy was (We were writing up a quick thing on prior knowledge of ancient Greece. <br/> 
Them: Okay, let's see. They invented democracy, right? <br/> 
Me: Right, okay. *writes it down* Hmmm, well, they were all about the sodomy, I know that. <br/> 
Them: Huh? What's sodomy? <br/> 
Me: Umm...let's see...when a daddy and a daddy love each other very much...) <br/> 
But anyway, I feel bad for not thinking my classmates are rad enough for me (my definition of rad, anyhow), because people can't really help their IQ or interests, and it's terrible to think I'm too good for them or something, because I'm sure they could possibly be lovely, interesting people, if I got to know them well enough. But... I don't know. I always feel like I'm either putting too much or too little faith in people. Anyhoo, I hope to find a few, or at least one rad person who wants to be friends with me. And even not-so-rad people are welcome!

      This man speaks the truth. You can tell this because he is obviously not attempting to have sex with you. In this case, what reason has he to lie? None. You are too rad for these girls. When you are in college there is a much greater chance that you will meet dudes and girls who are also very rad. There is also the chance that you won't and will just see them on the Internet still and wonder why they don't seem to be near you. This is the way of things and it sucks. But still, there is a stronger chance for awesome. Do not despair.

 <br/> 
see, this is why i don't "give it up", not to be a bitch or to make the dude's life a living hell. sometimes it's just more fun that way. like, why deprive the man of his chase? this dude, the same dude i was talking about who stopped calling me, would come over, and we'd watch some weird movie (flower of flesh and blood got us into a pretty interesting discussion on the effects of E), and then begin this cat and mouse chase. dude was on the wrestling team, but at our school, jocks still aren't really jocks. so then the makeouts would begin and he'd start grabbing me and tossing me around and i'll try to get out of his grasp by twisting or kneeing or biting and he'd be able to throw me and maneuver me in such a skillful manner that all of a sudden i'm on the table, and all of a sudden i'm on the floor with little to no impact, and all of a sudden i'm on the wooden railing of my third-floor porch and my whole upper body is hanging off the side and rain is pouring down my hair and stomach and the only thing keeping me from falling is this dudes hands holding the sides of my thighs. and then he'd pull me back up, and slapping and neck biting will ensue. and then we'll calm down and i'll give him an unforced kiss and then the erotic stuff's over and we start talking about Marcuse and grindcore. then he'd go home and i'd be hella fulfilled, glowing even. next day scratches all down my back, bruises all on my arms and collarbones. man, i'm be lying if i said i didn't miss the guy.

      The book also includes that part where he keeps that sewer rat and starves it and well... oh god.

I can't tell if I should be appalled or congratulate him for coming up with something that inventive that could actually start to cut through my detachment enough to disturb me. <br/>

      No, it makes it effective, which is what a work of art is "supposed" to do. There are outliers like that guy crawling around. I've also heard that about the book from other sources.  <br/>

      Seriously people, it's a fine line to tread making jokes about unfunny things.  Rape jokes can be funny, but if they are not, they are terrible.  You gotta be pretty sure about your joke before you post it.  I will throw into the ring with a Carlin line: <br/>

You think rape isn't funny?  Of course it can be funny.  Anything can be funny.  Imagine Porky Pig being raped by Elmer Fudd.  Hilarious.

      I will be vulnerable to criticism here and say that the mid-90s surf brands (Stussy, Mossimo, Rusty, Freshjive, etc.) made some pretty cool stuff back then.  I.E. they were the right clothes for the right time.  I don't see anyone hating on Shakespeare for his accordion-like ruff that he and the other dandies of the day wore about their neck.

      I honestly can't recall, but y'know, t-shirts and such. I was in middle school generally at the time. I did not, however, wear particular brands. I recall when Stussy was popular though and looking at the stuff and seeing that it was terrible.

      Not really. I didn't bother to learn the names of the majority of people I went to school with nor did I pay much attention to most of them. When I switched schools after my freshman year I didn't bother to tell anyone I was switching even though I was only moving to another school in the same district that was still rather close by. <br/>

I see what you're saying, but it's really not part of it in this case. <br/>

      While in college, I owned a pair of Z Cavaricci shorts that I thought were pretty cool.  They were light khaki with pinstripes of several different colors running down them. <br/> 
     I wore these shorts on my summer abroad in London.  They were basically the most fashionable shorts I owned, so I looked forward to wearing them. <br/> 
     The first night I wore them, my friends and I were walking through a small neighborhood to get to the Tube station.  A delightfully smashed Englishman staggered out of a pub and assumed a course parallel to ours.  My two friends started talking to the bloke, looking for some snarky fun during our otherwise uneventful walk. <br/> 
     Soon, the delightfully smashed Brit turned to me, and the following interchange occurred:   <br/> 
 <strong>Drunk Brit:</strong>   <em>"What's up wit' yor shorts, mate?"</em> <br/> 
 <strong>Me:</strong>   <em>"Nothing, I guess.  I'm wearing them, you see."</em> <br/> 
 <strong>Drunk Brit:</strong>   <em>"Do you like those things?"</em> <br/> 
 <strong>Me:</strong>   <em>"Well, yeah, I mean, I think they're pretty cool."</em> <br/> 
 <strong>Drunk Brit:</strong>   <em>"Naw, mate...They make you look like a bloody queer!"</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
We all laughed at this, and I wasn't going to be bothered by the words of a inebriated stranger, but my friends made sure to repeat his words ad nauseum (whether or not I was actually  <em>wearing</em>  said shorts.) <br/> 
After that trip, those shorts were never seen again.  I hope the misguided youth who picked them up from Goodwill never fancies a trip to England.

      I used to think so too, and for the most part still do, but even I couldn't deny the awesomeness of Bone Thugs N' Harmony's  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109022627/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S27CKzr_5SE">"Eternal"</a> . Not only is it sampled from one of my favorite Sega games, but it's pretty much the hip-hop equivalent of prog metal. The dude is rapping in polyrythms! <br/>

Then again, this is pretty much the only hip-hop song I've heard that I've liked, but I haven't really been motivated to find other ones.

      It's from Eternal Champions, which was a Street Fighter 2 type fighting game, with a pretty interesting historical concept and storyline. The original music is  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109022627/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbrkMN73mHs">here</a> .

      The interesting thing about Eternal Champions (it was also part of the general Sega "Extreme" phase and the one that was also part of fighting games at the time with plenty of fatalities and laughable blood that was still somehow controversial) was that it was one of the main games to use that weird octagon thing that Sega was trying to push at the time.

      My favorite explanation is that the triangular shape of the Flatiron Building on 23rd Street would create such strong winds at the corner that the it would lift the skirts of ladies walking past. This would attract the attention of all sorts of ruffians and ne'er-do-wells who would hang out at the corner so often that they had to be dispersed by the local constabulary, who were then said to be giving them the twenty-three skidoo.

      It is a pretty famous building.  You all have seen it before. <br/>

Biff: I think you  are thinking about the Transamerica Pyramid, in San Fransisco.  It is the tallest building.

      No it isn't. I think the new Rincon One tower is taller and when it's done the new Transbay Terminal building will be bigger than both. I don't think the Pyramid was ever really the biggest. It's just awesome and looks unique so people can easily find it. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Apparently it was pretty controversial when it was being built, but I like it a lot. I like the extra help in identifying the skyline. Plus it gives people something to shoot other than just the bridge. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are basically three establishing shots used for the city: the bridge with the city in the background shot from the Marin headlands, swooping in from the bay to the Ferry Building, and shooting from Twin Peaks and looking down over downtown. People never shoot anything from the south or west parts of town. Those are totally ignored by all.

      There is no such thing. <br/>

Rincon One looks like a giant air purifier. <br/>

The Transamerica building is a big, thin pyramid. It is very obvious what it is. I like it. <br/>

I do not see how a building could ever look like a fire hose.

      That's why it's basically unwatchable. I can't believe I lasted for over a season since it's so indescribably formulaic. I guess it's just because Hugh Laurie does a great job with the character. But that's to be expected. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Give me an episode with Stephen Fry and I'll watch that though.

      I loved the stuff Fry and Laurie did together, but absolutely loathe House.  Not just for the reasons mentioned above, but because I cannot suspend disbelief enough to believe that all these people would continue to disagree with the obviosuly FUCKING MAGICAL doctor, week after week after week, knowing they will be proven wrong for the hundred and fifty-ninth consecutive time.

      True, but the similarities are pretty heavy and striking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think one of the big problems is that it's fundamentally hard to make a medical mystery for the layperson. Not only would it be hard to present the evidence well, but most people aren't going to be able to put it together due to lack of knowledge. So you have to explain everything to them and then find another way to keep the mystery going.

      Again, only in the Legacy Unit. The entire Finnish metal scene could be taught in a few minutes. If you took all the main Finnish bands like Children of Bodom, Norther, Twilightning, Skyfire, Stratovarius, and Kalmah, then switched around all the band's vocalists, you would not be able to tell the difference. <br/>

Perhaps the book could say that they recorded Justice without any bass, and then sailed West.

      True, but Cliff was an essential part of the band and they were apparently total dicks to Newsted. It was also their last truly great album and it makes a valid time for them to have called it quits and left a legacy of greatness. Plus, well, they did consider breaking up.

 Dune was, beg pardon, ground-breaking, and it was arguably the golden age of Sci-Fi. <br/>

      The problem with making a movie out of  <em>Dune</em>  comes from the fact that, not only was the book about 100 times to long to make into a movie, but Herbert's stories are so densely packed with information. <br/> 
 <br/> 
To do  <em>Dune</em>  justice with a movie would require that it be about 300 hours long. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, the quality of special effects has just caught up with what the movie requires in, say, the last eleven minutes.

      I guess my father hit up SF a decade later cause his shelves are filled with Bradbury, Delany, and Vonnegut Jr. <br/>

Bit of a gaping hole where Niven is concerned, I haven't even read anything by him.  Always meant to get on it, but the local public library kinda lacks in that respect.

      The Mote in God's Eye is the best Heinlein novel that Niven ever wrote.  I think  <em>Protector, Ringworld, A Gift from Earth</em>  and the early short fiction in the Known Space universe are representative of his best work.

      I felt  <em>The Gripping Hand</em>  would have been OK not to have been written.  Not that the book was bad in and of itself, but I don't think it comes close to measuring up to  <em>Mote</em> .

      I guess no one is going to answer you, tekende, so I'll tell you that it's from  <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.</em>  It's another one of the shows which I'm not crazy about but which I see most episodes of anyway because I live with someone who likes it.

when a dude likes things that chicks like, chicks [sometimes] think he's gay.  <br/>

this betrays a subconscious acknowledgment on the part of [some] women that the things they do aren't universally awesome things, in a Kantian sense of "universal". this appears problematic to me, but i'd have to think about it some more to figure out why.

      I'm sure most of the rational ones recognize that some women contribute to it themselves. <br/> 
See: The Girls Next Door. <br/> 
Also I have a problem with the feminist definition of sexism, which is basically that only men can be sexist, because men have the power.  They still believe there can be sexual discrimination against men, and that it is wrong, but it is not sexism.  It just seems to me to justify being discriminatory against men, in a way.

      I don't think equality is a meaningful goal, no.  I don't want to be considered the same as a man, just given a fair hearing.  If one of my qualities makes me less suitable for a position, so be it - I'd rather jobs be filled by the most qualified than some sort of blind lottery that gives everyone an equal chance.  If a fireman is rescuing me, I sure as hell want it to be the strongest person who applied for the job, not the one who got in due to affirmative actions.

      But . .. that is being treated equal.  Giving someone a job when they are less qualified is treating that person inequally.  This is what feminists want, for there to be no distinction between male and female when it comes to getting a job etc.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And I don't believe you are a woman.  Pics or GTFO.  Not of boobies or anything.  But I find it hard to believe you are all a sudden a woman after being a man for all this time.  At least change your profile.

      I don't mean to be a prick, but if people insist on continuing to talk about feminism, I think we really need a crash course: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1. There are three distinct movements of feminism: the first wave, which was mainly the struggle for concrete political rights, the second wave, which occurred in the sixties and focused on the objectification of women and their still-marginal role in society, and the third wave, which has a more liberal attitude about sex and focuses more on gay/transgender issues and underlying cultural messages about gender. The "man-hating feminist" stereotype comes from the second wave while the "it's empowering to be a stripper" comes from the third. Loneal is a third waver. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2. Within almost each of these movements, there is a further split between "equality feminists" and "difference feminists". The former argue that most of what we consider "innate differences" between the sexes are the result of cultural conditioning, while the latter believe that women are in fact different but that these differences should be respected rather than assumed to be inferior. Some even go so far as to argue that logic is inherently male and that the "female" way of tangential, emotional thinking is just as valid. <br/> 
 <br/> 
3. Beyond these differences, there are infinite arguments about the root causes of oppression, what the long-term and short-term goals of feminism are, how they should be achieved, etc. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So making any sort of blanket statement like "feminism is about equality" or "feminists hate men" is reductive and pointless. Saying "I agree/disagree with feminism" is just as meaningless as saying "I agree/disagree with existentialism." Tell me your views on gender, and there will most likely be at least one feminist writer who is saying the exact same thing.

      I don't think it is entirely meaningless, I mean they are all about women rising up and trying to be treated as equals to men.  I think that all three movements agree with this, even the difference ones.   <br/> 
You make some pretty good points but I'm afraid to argue with you because you seem smarter than me and a little mad.

      Oh no, don't be afraid Philippe! Look, having been exposed to this at length doesn't make me smarter. I'm just trying to say that conversations about feminism that aren't at least somewhat informed usually end in silliness, like the one time someone asked loneal why a feminist would read Achewood, as if a feminist were some kind of mythical creature and not a label used to a greater or lesser extent by pretty much any girl who's been to college. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But yes, you're right in a sense. About the only thing feminists agree on is that women should not be held inferior to men. But there were some early feminists who called for the dissolution of the family and a return to the courtesan lifestyle. It's just an extremely tricky subject that you could spend your life studying if you wanted to. (I don't want to)

      I know it's complicated. Pretty much anything I say about them at this point is sort of a joke. This topic has gotten really old. That having been said, all the people I've ever met who self-apply the term "feminist" have invariably turned out to be pretty unbearable sorts of people, most of whom had no sense of humor about it at all. So I guess it's personal.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the end, I'll stick to what I can control. I, myself, will not oppress anyone. That's all I can do.

      Sounds like he was having you on. If you lamed him, would he know it?  <em>You've been lamed! :)</em> <br/>

      If a woman walked up to me and said "vagina" in a pleasant voice, I would assume that one of the following things were true: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1.  She wanted me to have an interaction with her vagina. <br/> 
 <br/> 
2.  She wanted to fuck with my head by making me thing she wanted me to have an interaction with her vagina, even though she didn't want that interaction. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Being the paranoid person that I am, I would probably settle on option 2, and retreat from the situation as soon as possible. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am not saying that there couldn't be some other reason for her saying it.  I am just saying that would be my reaction.

      It would depend on context. I could also see it as being some sort of performance art type of thing. It depends on how pretentious the place I am happens to be and how likely that would be. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I also would generally assume option 2, but I would still be happy for even that small interaction. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What was with girls trying to fuck with you in middle school and possibly high school by pretending that they were interested in you when they were clearly not just to be mean? I mean, I wasn't an idiot, I could clearly see through it at the time and hoped to kill their fun by remaining indifferent, but what was the damn point of it all? Some sort of cheap, mean ego-boosting thing? <br/> 
 <br/> 
The Simpsons has shown me that this was not just a personal thing, but something that happens to other people as well. I am glad. I do not relish having ignored real interest or being uniquely singled-out for this sort of thing.

      On that note, Cornelius is the kind of guy they'd be awestruck by... due to his amazing success, he'd be revered as a "natural". (Come to think of it, Cornelius is a pretty good match for the archetype David D is talking about in his programs) <br/>

      I was just wondering, if anyone has seen an interview or something that I haven't that explains this: does anyone know how Chris does Achewood?  Meaning tools, programs, etc.  Just out of curiosity, because lots of other webtoonists (new word? Lets hope) demonstrate their method/tech etc.

      First of all, sir, it is eight dollars where I am for a seven hundred and fifty milliliter bottle. That is wine bottle size for my fellow americans not accustomed to such measurements. A four pack is 14 dollars. Trust me though, it only hurts to buy it up until you take the first sip and the bubbles....well, just try it for yourself. <br/>

      the only time i was afraid was when they moved me from my medium-security quadrant to the ridiculously-low-security space, which was basically a frat house where you know everybody's made a mistake. also, at County you don't make 'special friends'. single-stall showers help that fact. also, there are so many illegals in there. dag, yo. so. many. <br/> 
 <br/> 
suffice to say, it is a Great Miracle i am out and a walkin', talkin' proof that prayer works. <br/>

i missed a few of you and was glad to see i'd only missed a few comics. <br/>

      When I was about your age, someone I respected assured me that jail was no fun at all, and so I have never been. <br/>

It's a little shocking to find out that you were incarcerated, and I truly hope that you didn't do lasting damage to your future prospects.

      You'd be surprised at who ends up in jail. The nerdiest, most harmless, and most "straight-shooter" type of all my friends (he gets sleepy if we stay out past 10pm and will categorically turn down a joint if someone passes it to him) is also the only one who's been incarcerated. He was at a party and someone decided it would be a good idea to sneak into the town pool after hours. He spent a night at the station. <br/>

      Long story. It just went on and on and on. Like being inside a movie called the 1970's. Well, the one episode I was thinking about, I got busted twice in 1 week, once in a Federal Park in West Texas. 6 of us for a roach. Do they still call it that? <br/> 
 <br/> 
 Some of the highlights included the 3 lesbians from Maine with a van full of drogas, much of which one of them flushed down a porta-potty, telling the deputy Dawg she was having her period. "She's ministratin', Captain!" <br/> 
"Okay, let her go to the restroom." <br/> 
Gotta love those rednecks. <br/> 
 Another was my agreeing to get a haircut while in jail so I didn't get the living shit beat out of me like the guy in the cell next to me, who didn't want a haircut. He got a very bad one anyway, along with a couple black eyes and scalp cuts. They cottoned right up to me after that.  <br/> 
 Another was them knowing that matchboxes were used for holding pot in, but not knowing what the blotter acid inside it was, and subsequently returning that to me when I signed out my possessions. <br/> 
 It went on and on. <br/>

      Yep, those were the days, everybody "holding," cops way behind on what we were getting high on.  I got pulled over for a busted tail light, and one of my passengers had a big slab of Lebanese sandstone hasg in her waistband. I hopped out and talked nice to the ossifers, and they let me go with a warning.  Much later, I did do a little "drunk and disorderly" time in Chicago.  Don't get locked up there!
