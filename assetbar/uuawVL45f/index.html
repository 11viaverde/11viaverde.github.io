      Ah.  Remember Retardo?  Those callow days when quoting the comic was not a excommunicable offense, when the worst thing you could do on the board was to constantly call Onstad gay (in a terribly unfunny way).  Those were simpler times. <br/>

      Because you can't do anything to a comment if you have the user on your Ignore list.  Conversely, you cannot click on the "Ignore User" link once you have marked a comment as spam or lame (or chubby, for that matter).  So, first you have to take them off your Ignore list, then you have to go marking things as spam, then you have to go hunting for other comments by that user that you have never marked before in order to get them back on to your Ignore list.  It's really a pain.

      Dear Assetbar, <br/> 
 <br/> 
Why don't I have spam marking privileges? I've been a very good boy this year, and I passed the spam/not spam certification test. <br/>

If you let me mark spam, I promise I won't complain about your horrible character support anymore. <br/>

      if you actually press on the head of this button, an error message will come up: "You do not have spam marking privileges." or something similar.  Although I know some users can do it, I assume it has something to do with seniority.

      Oh clever, I never thought of that.  That might be reason enough in itself to get the bonus material... Of course, it could also be a sysop kind of thing, people who know Onstad or work on other assetbar things (if there are any) or who he deems have earned his trust are given spam marking privileges.  It should work like Wikipedia rollback, where we the users can elect certain users to spam marking privilege status, but I don't think that's how it does work.

      I had spam-marking privileges before I subscribed to the bonus material.  I don't know Onstad or anyone at AssetBar, either.  I think it's random.  It could be seniority (e.g., signed up to AssetBar in the first two months), but that is effectively random, in my book.

      I don't know about retroactivation, but I have heard that, when one has given out many lames, one receives a message similar to the "too friendly" message for meeting chubby allotment, except it's more along the lines of "try doing something nice for a change."  Ye, though I have lamed all of poing's comments and all of the comments by socks that are lame (not all of them, actually) I have not received this message.

      Alright, here's the plan. As a whole, we rise up and declare the roles of chubbies and lames to be reversed. Lames become positive, and chubbies become negative. Nowhere is it written that it is as it is now; the glory of chubbies and contemptibility of lames is merely a collectively inferred illusion. We overthrow the system, crying revolution, and are free to grant lames to as many commendable comments per page as we please, concealing them from the public as a sort of premium service for those who have joined Assetbar; in turn, we would only chubby the five lamest of comments we found on the page, thus marking them with a green band of shame. The wise men and women of Acheworld shall look upon their high lame totals with pride; a high chubby count shall be even more notorious than a high lame count was under the Old System, as it indicates truly singular detestibility to earn one of a passerby's five chubbies. And never again shall any man say, " I would chubby you, but I am too Friendly." Tell me, under what system is friendliness the enemy, is friendliness the barrier that hems us in and limits us? A wrongful system, comrades, a system that it is the duty of the people to overtur- <br/>

      As far as I've been able to figure out, your lames, chubbies, and strips viewed are all related. <br/> 
 <br/> 
When you're a Newbie (under 100 strips viewed), you can only give out 3 chubbies per strip and make 1 comment every 24 hours.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
When you have over 100 strip views, you can chubby 5 times per strip. I'm not sure if this goes up again.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Your lame reserve doesn't automatically replenish, it's related to the number of chubbies you've given out  <em>and</em>  your strips viewed (or possibly strips rated). I'm not sure what the exact ratio is.

Between the couches is a coffee table containing a dictionary, a novel, a biography, and your seventh margarita of the evening. There are closed doors to the east and south. There are open doorways to the north and west. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#inventory <br/> 
 <br/> 
You have: <br/> 
     ennui <br/> 
     a laptop <br/> 
 <br/> 
#get up off the couch <br/> 
 <br/> 
You can see no reason whatsoever to get up off the couch. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#drink margarita <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's a big fucking surprise. You can now see even less reason to get up off the couch. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#use computer <br/> 
 <br/> 
What do you want to use the computer to do? <br/> 
 <br/> 
#insult poing <br/> 
 <br/> 
You cannot see a Poing in the computer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#unignore poing <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are no longer ignoring the Poing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#insult poing <br/> 
 <br/> 
Poing says, "You already told me that you were ignoring me! You epic fail teh win! HAHAHAHAHAHA!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
#status <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are feeling rather trolled.

      Spinynorman, I am intrigued by your choices of locale here. Why these places of London interest (sort of- who goes to Southwark Cathedral [though I am now tempted, just because I'm going that way and you mentioned it- it would be a Thing])? Are they referred to in a sketch I haven't seen, are they places you've visited and remember (I seem to think you are from Texas), or did they fall out of a Google miasma towards you? Also, chubby for you.

      The Falseprophet Text Adventure v. 1.04 <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are Falseprophet. You are in your parent's basement. There is a computer to the north. There are stairs to the west. There is a bookshelf to the east. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#look bookshelf <br/> 
 <br/> 
There are books here that you have read in your innocent youth and your not-so-innocent college days, books that you read and dissected for symbolism and to mine the skills of writers who came before you. You remember that promise you made to that friend who died that someday you would become an amazing writer who became the first black man to write a science fiction and fantasy novel that wins the National Book Award, PEN/Faulkner, Pulitzer, Hugo, and Nebula Awards all in the same damn year. You have many story ideas that could get published  <em>if you would only</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
#look computer <br/> 
 <br/> 
The program Firefox is opened to the  <em>Achewood</em>  homepage. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#use computer <br/> 
 <br/> 
You go to the computer and leave a comment on  <em>Achewood</em> . What sort of comment should you leave? <br/> 
 <br/> 
# short,sweet <br/> 
 <br/> 
You want to write something short and sweet, but you have EGO in your inventory. You cannot write short and sweet comments while EGO is in your inventory. <br/> 
 <br/> 
# long,Roast Beef <br/> 
 <br/> 
You try to write like Roast Beef. You get half chubbies and half lames. You are a divider not a unificater. Barack Obama does not pick you for his running mate. <br/> 
 <br/> 
# open Microsoft Word <br/> 
 <br/> 
You open Microsoft Word. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#write Great American Novel. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Memories of your douchebag thesis advisor verbally shitting on your novel fill your mind. You remember all of his unhelpful, pissant comments that sound like a high-school student complaining about not wanting to do a book report. You realize he is a toilet bowl that smokes a cigar. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#maximize Firefox. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You return to Firefox. Your Roast Beef comment has more lames and chubbies. You wonder where your thesis advisor would stand. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#Write new comment. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You write another comment. It gets some chubbies and no lames. This is how you spend your time. These are the fruits of your supposed literary talents. <br/> 
 <br/> 
# go west <br/> 
 <br/> 
You go west. There are stairs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#climb stairs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are in the kitchen. To the north is your parents' liquor. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#drink <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are drunk. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#drink <br/> 
 <br/> 
You are drunk. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#drink <br/> 
 <br/> 
Yousa drunk <br/> 
 <br/> 
#drink <br/> 
 <br/> 
Mothafucka <br/> 
 <br/> 
#drink <br/> 
 <br/> 
Get yo hand outta my pocket <br/> 
 <br/> 
You have failed the Falseprophet Text Adventure. Your final score was 6 out of a possible 6 pints.

      Honestly?   By paying too much attention to the upper-right-hand corner of the strip, after first noticing that Philippe's utterance uses the same blocky compu-font that Chucklebot speaks in, then spending a minute googling that font that's used on checks for easy OCR to see if it's that one (it's something like it at any rate), then returning to examine every inch of the panel to see what other gems of small touches Onstad thought to include.

      I just remembered something. This is fucking  <strong>important.</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
In like seventh grade, everyone in my science class was put into groups of, I dunno, four or something, and we all had to create some sort of skit or song about various parts of the body? My group chose (or was assigned, I don't remember) the digestive system, and we did (I am not kidding here) a song about the digestive system, set to the tune of "Walk the Dinosaur." <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am completely serious. That really happened. I'd managed to block the memories until now.

      LEVEL 2: <br/> 
 <br/> 
# start <br/> 
YOU ARE IN CORNELIUS' STUDY FACING NORTH. THERE IS A DESK IN FRONT OF YOU AND A GLOBE OF THE WORLD BY THE WALL TO THE WEST. CABINETS LINE THE WALLS ON THE WEST AND SOUTH.   AN OLD DRUM SITS DISCARDED ON THE FLOOR, A GAPING HOLE SHOWING THROUGH BOTH SIDES OF ITS AGE-MOTTLED SKIN. <br/> 
 <br/> 
# look desk <br/> 
IT IS A LARGE, EXPENSIVE-LOOKING MAHOGANY WRITING DESK WITH THREE DRAWERS ON THE LEFT SIDE. ITS SURFACE IS WHOLLY BARE BUT FOR A BOTTLE OF CORRECTION FLUID AND AN ISSUE OF THE ECONOMIST OPEN TO AN ARTICLE ABOUT LEVON TER-PETROSSIAN. <br/> 
 <br/> 
# read article <br/> 
THE ARTICLE CONTAINS FEW ILLUSTRATIONS OF BOATS AND DOES NOT HOLD YOUR INTEREST. <br/> 
 <br/> 
# look in drawers <br/> 
THE DRAWERS ARE LOCKED; YOU CANNOT OPEN THEM WITHOUT A KEY. <br/> 
 <br/> 
# look key <br/> 
YOU DO NOT HAVE A KEY. <br/> 
 <br/> 
# find key darnit <br/> 
YOU EXAMINE YOUR SURROUNDINGS IN AN EFFORT TO FIND THE KEY TO CORNELIUS%u2019 DESK DRAWERS. YOU SOON SEE A BRASS KEYRING STICKING OUT OF ONE OF THE WESTERN WALL CABINETS, TWO KEYS DANGLING FROM IT. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#take key <br/> 
YOU ARE FIVE. YOU CANNOT REACH THE KEY IN THE HIGH CABINET. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#climb globe <br/> 
YOU CLAMBER UP THE GLOBE STAND AND STRAIN TO REACH THE KEYS. PLACING A HIND LEG ON THE GLOBE AND KICKING OFF, YOU MANAGE TO LEAP AND SEIZE THEM FROM THE CABINET BEFORE CRASHING TO THE GROUND. YOU ARE MORE SHAKEN THAN HURT. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#open drawer <br/> 
WHICH DRAWER DO YOU WANT TO OPEN? <br/> 
 <br/> 
# open top drawer <br/> 
YOU OPEN THE TOP DRAWER. THERE IS SOME PAPERWORK, A CANISTER OF FINE DARJEELING, AND A COPY OF BREAST ATTACK ON FUCK MOUNTAIN. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#open middle drawer <br/> 
THERE ARE ASSORTED MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS INSIDE. A WELL-OILED 1946 CONN TRUMPET SITS IN FRONT OF A FRENCH HORN, A WAD OF CASH STICKING OUT OF THE MAIN HORN AREA, WHICH APPEARS TO BE CRUSHED. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#look cash <br/> 
YOU COUNT THE CASH AND IT COMES OUT TO A SIX HUNDO EVEN. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#take cash <br/> 
YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS THOUGHT. THIS IS A FALSE IDEA. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#open bottom drawer <br/> 
INSIDE IS A LOVELY COPY OF THAT GREATEST OF ILLLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS, THE BOOK OF KELLS. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#read book <br/> 
THE BOOK HAS SEVERAL IMAGES THAT MIGHT ALMOST REPRESENT BOATS, IF YOU SQUINT HARD ENOUGH. YOU WISH THE DRAWINGS WERE LESS ABSTRACT SO THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE MORE BOATS IN THE FUTURE. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#take correction fluid <br/> 
CORRECTION FLUID TAKEN. <br/> 
 <br/> 
#draw boats <br/> 
YOU PROCEED TO ENHANCE THE COLORFUL YET UNINSPIRED LINES OF THE BOOK OF KELLS BY TRACING OVER JUST THE RIGHT CURVES, WHORLS AND ARCHES WITH THE CORRECTION FLUID SO THAT OUT OF CHAOS APPEARS AN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY COASTAL SCHOONER. ISN%u2019T THAT SO MUCH BETTER? <br/>

      Might just be the way Onstad's house is actually laid out, a product of some slightly strange remodeling. A bunch of my friends live in a house in which the basement was remodeled in a similar fashion. Sometimes people will add bathrooms in really weird places as a matter of plumbing convenience, since adding a bathroom is the #1 way to make the house Worth More Money. Since this pantry is located right next to the living room, I'm guessing remodeled garage or addition, rather than original construction?

      I'd have to disagree. Why? So glad no one asked. Onstad has made a strange dream-scape of Phillipe being entirely unable to escape Cornelius' scorn. As a fucked-up subconscious projection it is pretty spectacular.

      Just because it's unfunny doesn't mean it's developing a character (I'm aware someone made this argument before). Onstad could have made a hilarious dialogue between the two to get the same point across, but didn't.

1. Bottle of Lochnamagnee "Old fecker" genuine scotch <br/> 
2. Short story by Phillipe "Constantius: Mayor of the clams!" <br/>

You try to launch into a defense of your offhand use of "you guys," but it's too late. A rampaging mob of women, politically-correct men and non-human individuals have strung you up and are carrying towards a giant, endless pit. You reason that, on the plus side, at least it's dark in the pit and you are likely to be eaten by a grue. <br/>

      Thanks, I guess.  I meant that to be part of my decades-long campaign to untether the gender correlation with "dude" and "guy."

      Someone used the word "heteronormative." It really doesn't matter, after that, what one thinks about feminism, patriarchy, Catholicism, the university setting, political correctness, sociology, psychology, sexuality, or genderisms.

      Along the lines of "heteronormative" is the word "homosocial." It describes macho-type social events that function as excuses for men to hang out together without women. Like football games, or trips to strip clubs. Totally fuckin' homosocial.

      The odds are that, in the future, this comment I am currently writing will be isolated in a sea of spams and lames, much like a keystone in the Great Wall of Horseshit.  <br/>

Sometimes one is struck with wonder. The speck of sand  used to make the lenses of your glasses may have once been part of the Great Pyramids themselves.  <br/>

      The Parthenon of horseshit. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A building built for the gods of horseshit, out of horseshit -- in hopes of creating more horseshit. A monolith with a singular purpose: to please the horseshit gods so that more horseshit may rain down upon the people (and the grass beneath the horseshitting horses) and so the horseshit will be a grander form of horseshit hitherto unknown. Carved deep in the annals of this dried horseshit labyrinth are seven words and a signature. <br/>

      I think it was the former. Basically she said that she thought Onstad jumped the shark with the GOF. I think that's going a bit too far, but honestly, I never understood why people loved it that much either. Here's the link, the comment is way up near the top.

      He and Dave Arenson invented the first roleplaying game and one of my favorites, and led to the creation of my favorite hobby.  I owe him great thanks.  My biggest regret in roleplaying is that I'll never be able to meet the man.

Wouldn't that be your biggest regret  <em>out</em>  of roleplaying? If you can fight a dragon, you can meet Gary Gygax. Granted, it might be a let-down when you find out he looks like your friend Phil and he's mad at you forgetting to bring the Mountain Dew. It was your  <em>week</em> , dude. <br/>
