      Are you suggesting Freud wouldn't have something to say about the astonishing success of the GOF arc?  That there's nothing suspect about all of us vicariously undergoing a primal test of worth and virility played out by anthropomorphized virtual cats?  That the closest we can come to experiencing the validation of masculinity that a concept like the GOF offers is to reiterate just how raw the part where the dude's face got ripped off was? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I ain't disagreeing with you or meaning to deny the awesomeness of the GOF, but as Dostoevsky wrote, "psychology is a knife that cuts both ways."

      An internet "white knight" is a person who rushes to the defense of others because they are so rad and they hope it increases their social status.  Usually they are rushing to the defense of a fat girl who looks sad in webcams because they want a piece of that.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
In this case they would be the kind of people who want the Achewood comment section to be a happy place where people only ever say good things and quote the strip they are commenting on while wondering why it's not a perfect five.  They are people who will post a link to another strip in the archives while fucking up their BBCode and for an encore they  <em>make a post about how they fucked up their BBCode!</em> <br/>

      I wonder how Ramses feels about having an engineer for a son. <br/>

Ray won the GOF, so there is something he can be proud of.  But an engineer seems antithetical to a man with that bumper sticker on his car. <br/>

Maybe fighter jet engineering is OK.

      The Purina website (of all places! thanks, Google) says "[male cats] . . . have a barbed penis, which will be painful for the female during mating." <br/> 
 <br/> 
Maybe that 3 minute relationship thing is all for the best? Maybe the girl cat is happy to see the boy cat go, so his barbed dick will never darken her door again? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I am glad this aspect of cat anatomy has not made the leap from the real world to Achewood. It would add a whole new uncomfortable layer to the Molly-Roast Beef relationship, among other things.

Before clicking 'search,' I said many prayers to the internet gods that they protect me from all evil.

      I have to agree with the sitcom guest thing.  Moreover, I have to call shenanigans on Dornheim.  "True master of leavery," is not in the idiom of an engineer who would repeat "lunch or a beer" and specify that he would go up to five miles in his Honda.  It sounds much more like the banter of Ray and Roast Beef, forced between Dornheim's bared teeth by the bitten and bloodied fingers of one Chris Onstad.  Do not make a cat eat words, friends; it ain't pretty.

      I dunno, man.  You say that "true master of leavery" sounds like Beef, but "lunch or a beer" doesn't?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think the dialogue in today's strip resembles that of Ray and Beef because Dornheim is opening up to his brother.  As he gradually sheds his engineer facade, his speech is naturally going to come to resemble Beef's.  The bond that Ray and Roast Beef share is pretty much the ultimate in friendship and camaraderie.

      I beg to differ. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The verbatim repetition of "lunch or a beer" was the issue, not the phrase all by itself.  Several others commented on the oddness of this last week.  The long-standing characters play with their phrasing, as in "But Pat, The Cure is silly!  It is silly to like The Cure!"  By repeating the "lunch or a beer" utterance, Onstad started to establish a distinct and somewhat rigid persona for Dornheim.  I didn't think "leavery" was consistent with that voice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The characters up to now have all had unique voices, Roast Beef most of all.  That feature is approximately the first one that is singled out in just about every review of Achewood, with immediate reference to the character blogs.  In other words, it is a prominent and non-accidental feature that helps to define Achewood as Achewood.  In that context (or in the real world, take your pick), I can't see that there's anything natural about sounding like Roast Beef, whom you've never met or even heard of, just because you're talking to someone that Roast Beef likes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glad we could disagree, hope to do it again someday.

      I kind of agree. Many of Dornheim's lines have that over-literal, unnecessarily-detailed quality that characterizes unsocialized nerds. But I think Onstad also had this great (rather poetic) concept he wanted to get across and put it in Dornheim's mouth, even though I don't think it quite belongs there.

      I happen to like dornheim. a good addition to the cast. where he'll end up, we'll find out as we go friends. we're in the backseat of this wild eccentric ride and Onstad is at the wheel. also there is bulletproof glass between us and the front seat. so buckle up, kick back, and enjoy the ride. no need to love or hate or overanalyze everything here. nowhere else you get to go to have cartoon cats delineate the intricacies of  <em>leaving</em>

      it does spark the imagination, causing you to wonder exactly how a man can do a thing. i think that when Dornheim was born, Ramses just looked at his new,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145129/https://achewood.com/index.php?date=03222005">meowing</a>  son, nodded, looked at Irene through a window and walked out of that hospital never meaning to look upon either ever again. *prays his bbcode works*

      I like the fact that Ray talks with Dornheim about cars and his movie script before they get around to talking about their Dad.  When Dornheim mentioned the whiskey sours along with Ramses in panel 2, I was sure Ray was going to want to discuss the art of mixing a perfect whiskey sour first.  I'd like to think the slight stutter in panel 3 was Ray pausing to shake off that impulse.

      At first I didn't like this arc, but I've reconsidered.  Insights into Ramses are too precious at this stage of the narrative development of Achewood to be spoiled by an actual substantial Ramses sighting.  Instead, we get glimpses from other bystanders.  He's probably the most interesting character that's undeveloped.  (With the possible exception of Cartilage Head).  I've wanted to know more about Ramses since I read the GOF arc.  He was a delicious enigma then, and instead of peeling back layers Onstad is just adding to the mix.  I hope he leaves Ramses alone for a few months and then Ray's mom brings Ramses back in.

      You know what, I'd almost rather never see Ramses in the present day again until we know Achewood is coming to a definite end for some reason. After his brief showing during the Great Outdoor Fight, it would almost seem to make him less amazing if he became anything more (or less) than a collection of second-hand accounts. We know more about Ramses from his bumper stickers and leaving abilities than we know about Todd from a couple years' worth of appearances. Let's keep it that way.

      The first time I saw Ramses, in the recollection of Ray's mom that lead to the GOF, he was such a badass.  Then, in the GOF arc when he talks to Ray and Beef, I considered whether he was real or a ghost, because he was still too much of a badass.  There is something very deeply important about Ramses that we should have to wait to learn.
