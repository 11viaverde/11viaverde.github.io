      Eh, the book was a lot better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It takes the correct viewpoint to appreciate, but it really is an excellent satire that doesn't pull punches. It doesn't demure to "then I brutally tortured and raped her for the rest of the evening" in any sense. It describes everything and increasingly gets more depraved. This is actually rather essential and makes sense in context as an escalation of psychosis (regardless of which interpretation you subscribe to). It is a work that is willing to "go there". It's not a sanitized work like Dexter that loses the power and brutality that should be kept in precisely because these are terrible acts and we best not forget that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm not trying to edgier or anything, but if you have a weak stomach for that sort of thing, well, you're just not going to appreciate it. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. I don't much care for nature. Not my scene. The only thing that would make someone a philistine is refusing to acknowledge that it might actually have legitimate depth and meaning. You can't take things out of context. <br/>

      Me too, but the Greenpeace kids have got to be the worst. Not that I have a beef with Greenpeace (sorry, but I don't). In fact, it's partly because I feel bad about blowing them off (whereas hot dumbasses touting cellphone plans are easy to shine on).   But the GP'ers . . . I  cannot BELIEVE those people. They  want you  to give them your  fucking credit card information. Right there. On the fucking street. As if in a million years anyone with half a brain would do that. <br/>

In fact, it always makes me think they're just scam artists. The streetcorner equivalent to all those crazily optimistic Nigerian emailers who can't even come close to writing American English but claim to be Mary Thomas from Iowa, or a GI serving in Iraq who found millions in a garbage can behind one of Saddam's palace. They don't even get the salutations right. And they're sending out more email all the time.

      exactly.  It's not the fact that they're trying to scam you that's so annoying.  What's annoying is that they suck so bad at it.  You'd think that they could, over time, develop a better awareness of both the language and the culture.  If you have internet access, then you should be able to dig up enough examples of writing and interaction to where you'd figure out those salutations, to where you'd figure out that in common American culture, every other sentence isn't bless you this and love of God that.  But no, they can't figure it out.  They're perpetually stuck in their own alternate reality.   <br/>

      It looks like he kind of perceives the details of her actual head, so there's some nubs where the ears are and little hairs in the middle where her hair parts. It's probably like how if you have a dream while half awake the imagery of the dream will sometimes partially incorporate stuff that's actually around you. For example the sun breaking over a tall cliff in the distance might look exactly like the light coming over the rippled top of your bedroom curtain. Schizophrenic hallucinations are said to be similar dreams, in that they are subconscious imagery that one cannot tell apart from reality, so it is a realistic assumption that details might translate in the same way. He has sort of transformed her hair to look like the trail of hair that might run down a mans back.

      see this is exactly why images need to stay off.  Images encourage laziness on the part of the poster and the reader.  Being forced to link to images, the posted must now go to the effort of explaining to the audience why they should click on the link.  Apparently most posters either can't be bothered, or aren't articulate enough to pull this off.  And most readers can't be bothered to click on a link.  And that's fine.  Let's not make reading assetbar any more of a lazy-ass experience than it already is.  People who are exceptionally drunk or stoned are boring, and a bunch of people in TV-watching zombie mode pretty much fits that bill.  We don't need to turn assetbar into a TV.  We don't need pictures popping up in front of our face.  We can survive without this.

      I was very much thinking of Nice Pete as a shitty mid-western redneck Ninja. Except for the whole "he's not really an assassin getting paid by anyone" thing.

      And there was I thinking up to panel 20 that Nice Pete had acquired Jedi mind powers. <br/> 
Oh well, we just need to wait for Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer to come in and rob the place, except in this scenario, Nice Pete doesn't have a soul on his person.

      I breathed a naive sigh of relief when it seemed like Nice Pete had "snapped out of it" in panel 20, only to re-inhale sharply when the pucker-face returned on the next one.  You can't snap out of being Nice Pete.  Nor can you read a pucker-face.

      I don't like how Onstrad is drawing Nice Pete's mouth, from the side.  It's too human looking, and kinda dopey looking too.  It also coveys a much different sort of facial expression than when Nice Pete's face is viewed facing you, which is problematic as we see different views of Pete in the same context.  It's like there are three different versions of Nice Pete in today's strip.  I bet that Onstrad came up with the side view after he gave the matter too much conscious thought.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now the waitress on the other hand - this could be the first time that he's drawn a female without it seeming like he was having trouble and falling short of meeting the challenge in some way.  Looks like it was drawn with ease, and it's a good quality drawing.  I'm talking about the last three panels anyway.  I have no idea what the fuck is up with the rest of the strip.

      Building nuclear power plants to alleviate energy shortage is like building more roads to alleviate congestion;  It doesn't work.  The only real solution is not not use so much energy, is for everyone to stop driving everywhere.  You charge your electric car off the nuclear powered grid, then you get in your car to drive to walmart.  If Green Peace is against that lifestyle, then more power to them.

      I fail to see how the problem of the environment is best addressed by regressing to the 17th century. The problem with forcing people to become self-sufficient is that sooner or later a bunch of people work out that it's more efficient for them to take other people's food through force of arms than grow their own. <br/>

      This is another strip where the simple, tiny changes of eyebrows speak volumes. The last two panels are incredible. Her eyebrows seem to convey, "Oh my god. This is now my problem." It is a problem that neither the bureaucracy, nor the salary of Denny's is designed to handle.

      The police. I learned a while ago that when you don't want to deal with something, when you have no idea how to handle a situation that is who is forced to deal with it. <br/>

Cleaning up other people's shit and possibly getting shot. Sounds like a great job.

      No. Nice Pete is a man who will always keep his word. His integrity is probably greater than any other character in Achewood. He simply has a different values system aside from that. But being a man of integrity is perhaps the thing he holds most dear.
