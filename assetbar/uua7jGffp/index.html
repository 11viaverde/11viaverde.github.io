      Don't let the movies get you down.  This is how James Bond actually orders martinis: Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon-peel. Got it? <br/>

      Nonsense!  Cocktails are too restricted in number of potential ingredients to allow for such fuzzy category placement, if you ask me.  To my mind, gin   dry vermouth   olive cannot comfortably morph into gin   vodka   Lillet   twist.  Perfect and dirty martinis I can accept, since they involve intensification/variation on the original ingredients, but not the more drastic substitution of Lillet for vermouth.  The substitution of vodka for gin is, of course, an ongoing matter of controversy, and I will leave that particular minefield to those more committed to the battle.

      Well, I wouldn't call it a "martini" per se, but yeah, he orders that drink. Once. To show off. And then he orders another one later in that book. For the rest of the novels, he's basically on bourbon and water and gin-tonics and daiquiris. He's got quite a bit of alcoholic range. I rather like how he gets his gin-tonics. Double, with a whole lime that he cuts himself in half, squeezed slightly and  dropped in, with tonic poured in afterwards.

      How do you keep them from getting all diluted? Or is that part of the preference? I'll admit, the finer points of these things can escape me. That whole adding water to scotch thing, for instance. I've heard that it's supposed to bring out the flavor or something, but it just seems  <em>wrong.</em>

      I believe the water-into-scotch theorem is meant to lessen the alcoholic sting of the drink, thus making the more subtle fragrances of the malt more noticeable, as they were probably overridden by the whole "holy shit, this is booze" effect. <br/> 
 <br/> 
A martini is going to get diluted no matter what, I believe. Stirring seems like it's more likely to dilute it than shaking it, though shaking it is going to add chips of ice into the gin. There are different shakers that strain these out with a wire mesh, though.

      I prefer to drink my scotch (or irish whiskey) with rocks, letting the melt just enough to cool it down and dilute it more subtly than I could possibly manage with a faucet or a pitcher.  Reduces the "oh, booze!" effect and is tastier for me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, shaking a martini "bruises" the alcohol by exposing it more thoroughly to air (specifically oxygen, a reactive species.)  This makes it taste more strongly.  Both stirring and shaking introduce water.

      The more I drink whisk(e)ys on the rocks, the more I find the chill (not the dilution) kills the depth of the drink. I usually go scotch with a splash of soda and bourbon with a splash of water nowadays. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The bruising thing is a misnomer, the real difference is the amount of dilution and chilling present. People who strongly prefer stirred martinis do so out of an aversion to the ice flakes and extra chilling (once again numbing the complexity of the spirit) that shaking adds.

      You shouldn't be too proud to get drunk in the expensive stuff. It can be a rewarding experience under the right circumstances. No better medicine for a heartache, for example. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I only add a few drops of water if it's a new whiskey I want to try and decipher all the flavours in. Otherwise I take it straight up, at room temperature. I like the shock of the alcohol, and I actually find myself going for the heavier voltage the older I get. I crave the crass stuff.

      Red Gold is my ketchup of choice, what does that say about my background?  I never see anyone even speak on Red Gold, anywhere.  It's like the ketchup time forgot, livin in the land of the lost.

      What is it like? The ketchup that I have in my fridge is Tesco Finest Ketchup. It seems to be a combination of pulverised sundried tomatoes, tomato pureee, and molasses. Some lemon and vinegar.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is not a good ketchup.

      As it happens I know the heir to a graft fortune, from Florida, and he orders his steak well done. Nice guy, but he really does do that.

      It's different with filets. They're pretty tasteless without the redness or a good marinade, and their tenderness is the main attraction, so ordering it rare (mid-rare at the absolute most) is the main thing to do.

      I have to tell you... <br/> 
blini are not potato pancakes. latkes are potato pancakes. blini are essentially crepes; they're made with flour, or buckwheat.

      My ex-fiancee would cringe. She worked at a very prestigious steakhouse (how they get that way, I'll never know) and was so adamant about steak being medium rare, all the time, that I can't even order my burgers any other way when asked.
