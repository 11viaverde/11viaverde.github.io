      Philippe going to live with his nutty mother is a pretty sad thing in itself. The weird presents were kind of sweet, but anyone who sends Jack Chick pamphlets to a five year-old should not be allowed near children.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wonder if Philippe's mother is an ardent and active Teabag-Partier.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
I wonder also if Drew Weing's first guest strip will turn out to be horribly prophetic.

      I'd want to ask "how much can a 'Teabag-Partier' corrupt a child," but after having in person seen many such bring their children to rallies and dress then up and have them hold signs, I already know most of the answer. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, there have, surely, been parents making their children subjects of inadvertent political action since whenever; I don't doubt that.   But, little tykes with tri-korn hats and signs saying "take your hands off my previously-unborn body" just doesn't make me like today's American political discourse.

      There's a difference between educating one's children about politics and society and parading them around while pushing your own agenda. This kind of "exposure" seems more like waving genitalia in front of a kid and demanding they try to make sense of what they're seeing. <br/>

Don't matter which end of the spectrum you're on, a five year old has no business being plopped in the middle of any kind of political discourse.

      It happened in almost every movie made in the 1980s in which a cute but inexplicably unpopular child befriended an alien or wild animal.  Eventually a man with a mustache or hat would decide that he wanted to kill or capture the alien or wild animal, and that meant that the kid would have to chase it away, leading to the most poignant theatrical meme ever dreamed up by a Jew in a Hawaiian shirt while talking on a huge cell phone in his convertible.

      If you add up the collective karma of a government and/or of it's people, the U.S. is not doing as well as some other countries.   <br/>

I'm not sure I'd even call 9/11 "major."  A couple a buildings got 'sploded, that's all.  WWI & WWII were major.  The death and destruction in Iraq these past few years - major.  That tsunami in the pacific, the earthquake in Haiti -- all major.  9/11...  9/11 was like a lame-ass sparkler that fizzles out halfway through.  It's not like the world didn't already know, before 9/11, that planes can crash.  Indeed, the world already knew that terrorists wanted to crash planes like this on purpose.  This is nothing new.  Remember the Japanese in WWII?  The Kamikaze pilots?

      it's possible that people are more bothered that human beings died rather than that the buildings 'sploded, and  that anyone died at all, rather than how many in comparison to any other time, these things not being a competition, or indeed working on a turn-based system. <br/>

      So, idiotic actions of a government justify the murder of innocents? Among the thousands killed on 9/11, I'm fairly certain at least a couple were anti-war. Not to mention that 9/11 gave the Bush administration a pretense and a favorable political climate for war in Iraq. Bush would have been a useless one-termer if not for 9/11. So not only were the attacks directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of people--all of whom had differing political opinions, some of whom certainly did not support certain actions of the US government in the past--but it also indirectly led to every death of a civilian or soldier in Iraq or Afghanistan since those wars started. Which in turn led to people like you (odd that you refer to Americans as "ethnocentric [and] jingoistic" but have no problem classifying one of the least homogeneous nations on Earth as one big happy evil third world invading family) using those wars as "evidence" that it's not such a bad thing that innocent people got murdered to advance someone's political or religious agenda. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know where you're from, and I don't particularly care--no government is innocent of heinous decisions. America's just happen to be some of the more visible. But what I am curious about is how you can possibly think that mass murder is justified because the victims lived in the same place as some people who supported some things you don't like. I'm also curious as to how you can think yourself morally superior to an American with the "nuke 'em all" mentality when your thought process is exactly the same.

      I appreciate your reasoned reply.  Sure, killing people isn't a good thing.  I'm against capital punishment, although I think that if I had to choose, I'd shoot Sarah Palin in the head if it would save a dog or cat's life.  (I believe that Sarah Palin is less human than the average dog or cat.)  Sarah Palin is the kind of person who, when you look at his or her myspace or facebook page, and you start looking at his or her friends, you start to wonder "are these people human?"  I dunno if you've ever had that experience before.  Really, I don't think it's possible for a person to imagine what these creatures are really like until you put on the camo paint and get the camera with the long-range lens and the binoculars and you carefully and quietly observe them in their natural habitat for a good period of time.  Some Republican American in a zoo cage is just not the same thing as one of these beasts out in the wild. <br/> 
 <br/> 
There is a segment of America that is pretty damn jingoistic and ethnocentric...  This segment is totally on a par with the crazy extremist suicide bombing jihadists.  Extremist Muslims and extremist American Christians... They're all the same. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In so far as America is jingoistic and ethnocentric, 9/11 was a pretty great thing.  These people get all worked up about 9/11 for the wrong reasons.  9/11 pisses these people off because it trips their sense of ethnocentrism and jingoism.  I can imagine no worse insult to the dead of 9/11 as the inane rambling and ranting of a patriotic American.  It is the ignorance of these people at which the violence of 9/11 was directed.  Certainly, violence doesn't and can't magically fix a people's ignorance.  Bearing witness to 9/11 isn't going to magically serve as a substitute for the education and human awareness that so many Americans lack.  But still, one has to wonder if in some corners of the American psyche, the violence of 9/11 didn't on some level give the ignorant some pause to think, if it didn't open them up to some level of awareness (to the meager extent to which they are capable of it anyway) of the outside world, and the wants and needs of a humanity that is tired of America fucking with it?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Likewise, the violence against Israel certainly has been a dead end for many generations, and it would be in Palestine's best interest to have move past it long ago.  But were it not for the violence, would there even be an alternative to move towards? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, saying that 9/11 was a good thing is merely a form of rhetorical violence against the jingoism and ethnocentrism of America.  As Martha Steward would say, "It's a good thing!"

      There's a segment of most countries that is jingoistic and ethnocentric. I studied in England for a few months a little while back; I went to Northampton for a Stiff Little Fingers show (which fucking rocked, by the way), and waiting for the coach on the way back I had an older English man tell me that "if you're not white, get the fuck out of my country!" I didn't take it as representative of the English population though; I assumed he was just some BNP asshole and moved on. I'm not a fan of the kinds of Americans who kill abortion doctors, but to act as though they represent the majority of Americans is just as ignorant as assuming that Osama bin Ladin represents the majority of Muslims. <br/> 
 <br/> 
9/11 doesn't piss people off (well, at least most people) because it "trips their sense of ethnocentrism and jingoism." It pisses people off because it's mass murder by religious fanatics. Sure, the fact that the victims were from similar backgrounds makes it hit closer to home, but that's not ethnocentrism--that's simply identifying with the dead. The same way that British citizens identified with victims of the Tube bombings, or Spanish citizens identified with victims of the rail bombings there. And the violence of 9/11 was not directed at the people who make a difference. I'm less outraged about the attack on the Pentagon, because it's a legitimate military target (although using a civilian airliner as a missile is wrong)--I may disagree with their motivations, and consider them an enemy, but it's not the same as deliberately targeting civilians, the overwhelming majority of whom have absolutely no bearing on economic or foreign policy. And I find it ridiculous that you think that a normally jingoistic, ethnocentric American would suddenly have their eyes opened by 9/11. The people who actually need their eyes opened are the same ones who are going to assume that 9/11 happened because "they hate freedom/Jesus/Amurika." The ones who are examining the causes are the ones who were thinking critically in the first place.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
You may think that saying 9/11 was a good thing is an effective form of discourse, but in reality all it does is make those who actually need to be brought into the debate tune you out, and make the rest of us (who already think critically) assume that you support mass murder by religious fanatics, so long as said fanatics represent an entity that's not a superpower. It makes you sound ridiculous and reactionary, and at least as small-minded as the (minority of) Americans who want to turn the Middle East into radioactive glass.

      No I don't believe that the violence of 9/11 will suddenly open people's eyes, but I do believe that it will start at least a few ignorant people down a path of introspection.  It's a start, is all.  It creates opportunity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Likewise, maybe somewhere in my violent rhetoric, a few people like you (although apparently not you) might get started down an introspective path where they question just what is, if not ethnocentrism, a failure to identify with victims of violence when such failure correlates with the victim's country of residence being different from one's own country of residence. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If mass murder by religious fanatics really pissed off most Americans the way you seem to think it does, then the U.S. wouldn't show almost ZERO interest in most instances thereof.  No, most Americans only care about Americans.  That is racism and ethnocentrism.  If you want to spin it differently, by all means, give it a try. <br/>

      Wait, you mean people tend to care more about an event when it occurs in their own country or to people who seem familiar? HOLY SHIT RACISM OH NOES. Please, explain to me how identification with a particular group, and increased empathy for other members of that group, is "racism." I suppose that means Britain is equally racist for using more newspaper space on domestic tragedies than foreign ones? Likewise Spain, Germany, Russia, and for that matter every other country in the world? <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's good to know that you are such an enlightened citizen of the world that you feel just as affected by the murder of some guy in the Congo as you would by the murder of your next door neighbor. Perhaps you're just more evolved than us, and I suppose in that case you're justified in masturbating to your own self-righteousness with a smug smile on your face. Most people, however, empathize more closely with people they know, or people who know people they know, etc. That's not racism, that's normal human behavior. If you want to spin it differently, by all means, give it a try.

      saying that you don't place the same nationalist significance on the event as a lot of people seem to - reasonable. <br/> 
 <br/> 
saying you don't care  <strong>at all</strong>  that some people died - getting too involved in the backlash there. you can disagree with the silly things people take away from the incident, but trivializing the deaths of a couple hundred people mostly suggests you're fighting those silly things waaay off-target. <br/> 
 <br/> 
like, yeah, I don't think that "EVERYTHING CHANGED ON 9/11" either, but I still think it sucks that people died. it always sucks when people die like that. they sure as hell didn't know that they were gonna be used as soapboxes after the fact, so I figure they still deserve some respect, y'know?

      Of course, it would make no practical difference.  It's not like he'd be killing Philippe off, and it's not like characters in this comic -stay- dead anyway...  All that would happen is Philippe wouldn't appear in any of the comics for a while.

      I have often slept on a bare matress. This is because daytime-me goes "Dirty sheets! Disgusting. Time to stick these in the machine then reward myself with a nice little trip down the pub." Then drunken-evening-me goes "Fuggin no sheets on the bed. Fuggit. Time for sleep."

      That reminds me of my freshman year roommate.  He would come in late, literally soaked in beer, strip off and lie naked on his bed.  Often he was not alone.  The second half of the year, his bed had no sheets.  Which was not surprising; at that point, he would go through the pile in his closet every day to find his least smelly shirt.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
When the year was over and he took off, I cleaned the room to avoid a cleaning fee.  Down behind his bed, stuffed between the radiator and the bedframe, I found a hard, brown, crinkly, round-ish object, about eight inches around.  Have you ever had a really good, old, cave-aged cheese?  Kind of that color, not nearly as dense, but just as rough and similarly hard to the touch.  Closer inspection revealed it to be tightly wadded cloth with a long tear down the middle--his missing sheet, semi-petrified with sweat, alcohol, semen, and long exposure to steam heat. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know what's worst here.  That I touched that thing; that he got so much action while being such a pig; or that he went on to found a non-profit that finds people jobs, feeds and houses the homeless, and shoots rainbows out its ass, so now he's a humanitarian of some renown.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Shit, I guess it's that I would be annoyed by the last one.

      Thanks for the advice I think I'll try to make a poem <br/> 
 <br/> 
In the lines running through my head <br/> 
There is one thing that I dread <br/> 
Putting words onto a page <br/> 
Drives me into incandescent rage <br/> 
Seems to be how I'm made <br/> 
Fuck this poem <br/> 
and that guy <br/> 
Who made <br/> 
Me write it <br/> 
Wait he didn't make me write it <br/> 
Whatever.
