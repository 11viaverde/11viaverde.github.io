      Ah, but have you seen an artificial vagina? <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also: have you  <em>felt</em>  the dildo?  Not in your ass or anything, just...have you felt it? <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm curious as to the hardness of them.  Whenever you see them on TV and movies, they seem floppy and stuff, which I don't see as practical for insertion given the overwhelming rigidity of one's natural erect penis.  But I could be wrong.

      Bragging not intended, I assure you.  I'm merely positing the question of why they make 'em floppy when the harder side of floppy (while still being malleable on the outside) would surely be preferable for vaginal insertion.  I am unsure about the poop chute's preference. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Granted, it depends on the day, and the moment - one's wang, when aroused, can be anything from a bit floppy but keeping a general shape, to rock hard if you haven't gotten any in a while - but the latter would surely be what would be higher selling in the dildo sales, I would assume. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Then again, I have no experience in the field of sex toys, so I dunno. <br/>

      My guess is that when it's floppy you can bend it slightly while inserting it thus making more surface area contact with different parts of the labia.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It is probably more sensual to move that around rather than something steel-hard. That would just hurt.

      Jeezus, am I the only female/ gay here?  Okay, dildos can be made of all sorts of materials: silicone, plastic, Pyrex, steel, glass, porcelain, Cyberskin, etc.  So the rigidity varies depending on the material and whether there's some internal structural support in there.  Same goes for butt plugs, which should have a rimmed base or something to keep the plug from...getting sucked all the way in, and potentially causing some serious damage.  Bad times.

      Good lord, you do not know what you are talking about.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Glass dildos retain heat and cold exceptionally well, create very little friction, can be sterilized easily, and there are some glass dildos out there that are so beautifully made, they could be classified as art objects.  And as long as you don't heat or freeze them too quickly, or throw them around and break them, they're as safe as can be.

      I'm fine with it, but the website won't tell you exactly of what their "Superskin" is made.  It's not silicone, so it's anything like Cyberskin, PVC, or jelly-rubber, you should use a condom, because those materials are porous and can't ever really be cleaned.  Plus they can cause allergic reactions in some.  *shrug*  Buyer beware, I guess.

      Downstream economic and political fall-out: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Dunkin' Donuts comes out with a copycat product for the lower-level masses, promoting it with a campaign called "Go Dil-Do-Nuts!"   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Parents are outraged when a cover story in Time reports that the iced version, the "Chill-Do-Nuts," is the best-selling frozen drink among 13- to 17-year-olds.  Meanwhile, sales are near zero among men between the ages of 20 and 99.  When asked why in a customer survey, they deny that it ever happened to them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sales of the "Mocha Blast" version are restricted to small sizes in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and some counties Arizona.  Large protest rallies ensue in Chicago, New York, and LA, climaxing in a march on the National Mall. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Carl's Jr. tries to capitalize on the controversy with a copy-cat product of their own, bringing back Paris Hilton for the ads.  They consider using stock footage, but she demands a higher fee for the rights to the night-camera scenes.  Then they figure everyone has seen it anyway, so they just use a still of her face and an innuendo-laden voice-over.  Sales are poor.  Customer surveys reveal that no one would touch that even with someone else's fake pole.

      I don't know, by my understanding, dildos are penis-shaped and don't vibrate.  Vibrators and "personal massagers" can be all kinds of shapes and do vibrate.  And are people really still hung up on having dildos in their home?  Are they still that "underground" that only perverts and freaks would dare to use them?   <br/>

I'm all for Lyle's idea, it sounds awesome, but the terminology of the strip bothers me somewhat.  Also, I really hope that dildo isn't made of PVC or *shudder* jelly-rubber.  All leaking phthalates into the cappuccinos.

      Personally, I'd rather Lyle have a dildo in the house than on the street somewhere.  Although I admit that I would totally get my coffee at that stand.

      I don't know, I feel like a year or two earlier this would have been a weird comic to read, but now it almost feels like par for the course. After SaniTaco, and Lyle and Ray's Perfect Jays, this feels kind of done.

      Lyle, don't have a dildo in the house! It'll cause problems. It'll get Garfield drummed out of the union. It'll bring untold wealth upon Philippe, making him lose respect for his elders. It'll lure one of the main perverts of the Internet to the house. It'll cause Ray to contract assassins.

      Lyle is trying to keep his mind alive.  He sees a dildo as the most effective way to do this. Instantly goes on the defensive when confronted by T about this, probably because dildoes (sp?  I don't want to google this, please don't make me) have the capacity to prevent Alzheimer's.  Lyle doesn't know this, only that the dildo is important  <em>somehow</em>

      The first time I saw a dildo with my own eyes was in college. We were over at the apartment of these two sisters, and one was gone. The other was looking for something in their room, desperately, and asked us to help. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I will never forget it. Donald was fishing around deep under the bed and suddenly his expression turned to one of pure shock, his eyes bulging and his mouth wide open. He gasped, and we went silent. I heard the buzzing moments before he pulled out the other sister's dildo.
