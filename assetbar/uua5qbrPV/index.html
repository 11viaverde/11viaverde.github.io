I noted it on the next strip too, but seriously - Chris: if you set up a vacation/sick day account on Paypal I would totally contribute.  You shouldn't feel pressure to put out filler (even if it is interesting fucked up shit). <br/>

I really hope this AssBar feature isn't making you feel too much pressure!  Remember, all the asses complaining about the lack of a strip or a late posting are not everyone.  Lots of us are patiently waiting, and would wait a week or two for quality Achewood.

If enough other users (say, 20%) put someone on their permanent Ignore list, then they are put on everyone's Ignore list by default.  To see their comments, you'd have to go and un-Ignore them on purpose. <br/>

      Nah, man, you got it wrong.  Some people want to sass the artist and all of his fans, and that's their right.  But I'm here because I enjoy Achewood, and I want to interact with other people who enjoy Achewood.  Having to wade through comments by negativists is just a waste of my time, and I will be less likely to use this forum if it becomes a burden.  If the sassers are identified by themselves or by the rest of the users, then I can choose whether to be confronted by their comments, some of which are posted for the sole purpose of offending other users.  Likewise, they might choose to have nothing to do with me.  If that type of distinction is not available in the system somewhere, then you and they and I do not get to make that choice. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That said, default ignore is not the best idea in the world.  It's self-defeating in some ways, and no better than the voluntary ignore feature we have now.  Yeah, I'm the same guy who suggested it in the first place; I've just had more time to think about it.

      Chris, <br/> 
 <br/> 
My doctor has me irrigating.  It sounds disgusting, but it feels great.  It helps your sinuses, not so much the lungs.  Take 2 cups of warm water, and stir in 1 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of baking soda.  (I always skip the baking soda; the salt doesn't bother me.)  Then, using a big plastic syringe (Nasaline brand is one) or a squirt bottle, squirt the salt water up your nose while you lean over the sink.  It goes in one nostril and comes out the other.  That's the gross part, along with all the stuff that comes out with it.  A little in each nostril (60 cc), with nose-blowing in between, will get that mucus right out of there.  Before bed and when you wake up, and the day is so much better. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Good luck getting over whatever it is.

      That water solution process is generally done with a thing called a "netty pot," and is pretty good for keeping your sinuses healthy and avoiding related illnesses. Since the morning lung congestion is a result of everything from your nose dripping down into your lungs while you sleep, I would really recommend this one for you Onstad.

      Okay, I know rad_chillies will find this unfair, after I castigated him/her last week for a similar attempt at sarcasm.  What differentiates stiff's post is the quality of the imagery.  Taking out your Achewood-related frustration on co-workers is good, but finding no Achewood spider under the virtual rock?  That's inspired.  Stiff took too long to get to that point, I'd say, but by the end it was perfectly clear that the initial appearance of ingratitude was ironic, and really this person does not know what to do with a day that does not include an Achewood fix.  That's sad, but Onstad should be flattered.

      Feel better, but even more importantly, don't die. Maybe find out exactly what the illness is? Could be pneumonia or something like someone said. <br/>

At any rate, it'd be pretty surreal if we were looking at the last ever Achewood strip, an unfinished work given a bizarre and tragic ending. Best not think of it that way though I guess. Hella depressing. <br/>

      i see what you're saying.  it's different when chris is a character himself, interacting with the other characters within the bounds of the 'reality' of the strip - as opposed to situations like this that clearly say 'ray, téodor, nice pete's severed leg, and everyone else are just comic strip drawings that are voiced and controlled by a single author'.

      But see, it goes along with the surreal nature of the strip...the narrative of achewood and its interaction with its author and audience has never followed set rules.  <br/>

Is there even really a fourth wall in this strip?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's a postmodern thing.

      Yeah, there's definitely a fourth wall, and it's lame when it's broken. The postmodern thing was cool for about 2 years in the sixties. <br/>

Besides, it's so much more awesome when Chris shows up in the strip as a giant pair of legs and picks up Ray or Beef.

      Speaking of which, has anyone else noticed that you can give yourself a chubby in Acheworld?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
That is, a member can give himself a rating.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I mean, there are members I wouldn't touch with a long pole, but even if they are left with no one but themselves to play with, they can at least get some gratification all on their own.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Of course, you'd have to be a bonehead to jerk other people around on this site.  If you give positive strokes, you'll make friends who will give you chubbies.  Or better yet, a complete stranger will give you a chubby from time to time. <br/>

Chicken soup with lots of garlic and onion also helps get rid of your plague faster. <br/>
