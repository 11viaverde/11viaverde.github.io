      Bad timing, dude. Our hearts were just broken when Ray had to drop out of the race. Don't remind us. Normally I would say "there comes a time" - but this is not the case. There is never a time for real life politics on Achewood.

      Oh i get it.  I was going to make fun of you because the account was obviously created yesterday to make fun of someone else's sock puppet account.  But that wasn't the joke, was it?  There's something cleverer going on here, right? <br/>

I do this, because I am from... the Internet! <br/>

      No way, man. Those shoes are so very hipster girl in black three quarter length tights, striped cardigan, huge brown leather "vintage" purse, long faux-60's hair and Edie Sedgewick eyeliner.  Just looking at them, I can hear indie dancepop playing in the background.

      I think they have more of a mod-kitsch value than a kitschy aunt value. They are au courant because  <em>they</em>  are old, not because they look like they belong to an old person. <br/>

I dunno. Maybe I think this because my spinster aunt bought all her shoes at Wal-Mart and they were all flats. When was the last time you saw a spinster in three inch heels?

      Teodor has never exactly been an ass magnet. It probably took him a while to realize what sex sounds like, even if it is some sort of bizarre fusion of turn-of-the-century literature and blaxploitation jive. <br/> 
 <br/> 
You know, it's weird that Roast Beef is the only cat who is getting him some bitta bitta action these days. Ray has only been seen to sport the fuck-crown about twice, maybe - Cornelius's love interests are all dead, one by natural causes the other by despair and bus - Lyle is a "hole man" and I really would prefer if his mercenary-like romancing of recent transgenders did not count - and while Todd is the Steve Irwin of gonorrhea, he is not the captain of his soul nor the chief petty officer of his libido.  <br/>

Way to go, Roast Beef. Dump more loads in Molly than a mother of three on laundry day. Only, you know, more romantic-like.

      291 chubbs as of 5/24/09. Gotta be the highest rated photoshop on assetbar. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Inexplicably, there are three lames. Obviously one was from shades. As if giving a lame would be enough to make one feel OK about being the butt of arguably the most popular joke in the short but storied history of this little corner of the internet. But who were the others? I guess I could check, but I'll just let it go unanswered for now. Whoever you are -  <em>for shame.</em> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anybody have any guesses as to what the most chubbied text-only post might be? I mean, it's obviously something by spinynorman, but does anyone know which one?

spinynorman is obviously an AssetBar Hero, with over 10,000 chubbies, but for some reason his comments don't usually break  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145057/https://m.assetbar.com/achewood/uua7qTWJ0#comment_74">100</a> . Maybe it's because they're often anecdotal and only tangentially related to the strip. Or maybe he's just too damn clever for us. <br/>

      I applaud your excellent research, sir. This is a fantastic appraisal. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't look around too much because I've made way too many damn comments, but I'd be shocked if I ever broke the 40 chub mark in my career. Not knowing how to make gifs or work photoshop doesn't do me any favors. Making a lot of enemies and having a naturally dry sense of humor probably doesn't help much, either.

      Just because other people's pet names make me uncomfortable does not make me a 'hater' of them!  I may wince when friends call each other ridiculous things, but I don't actively avoid their company.  I'm happy to discuss their myriad fetishes and where to buy supplies for such activities, so while I may be slightly uncomfortable with one small aspect of some human relationships, I am not usually prudish.

      OK, I'll take your word for it that you don't go around telling people who use pet names that prayer can cure it. I did keep my mouth shut until your third post on this topic, but, sexual tolerance is about being fine with what (consensual, adult) activity you  <em>don't</em>  like, that's the whole point. Anyway, we can split the difference between "prudish" and "cool" and call the fact that you're fine with heavy fetishes but squicked with pet names "impractical."

      Not only was that ridiculously annoying to read (you are not a CAT sir), it was also wrong. I know plenty of young married couples that do exactly what Teodor is doing. Maybe when they're 30  they'll grow out of it. But something about our generation fucking loves takeout and youtube. And if they can get away with it without pants, then damn if they're not going to.

      Earendil was a character in Tolkien's Silmarillion. Right now, he's charting the Ilmen betwixt the Gates of Morning and the Doors of night aboard the  <em>Vingilot</em>  with a Silmaril lighting the way, and Lady Elwing at his side. <br/>

      i chubbied you for having the mere ability to get through Silmarillion. I bought a copy about 4 years ago, read the first 10 pages and haven't picked it up since. It's not that I'm a bad reader or anything, just that Tolkien and I aren't really friends. I could barely get through The Hobbit. Under Hill, Over Hill is possibly the most tedious chapter in literary history -- excluding the Moby Dick chapters that explain whales in detail that I've only heard about.

      When something negative rules your life as much as depression rules Roast Beef's life (and Molly's by extension) you have to make light of it to get into a happy place.  I mean who wants a sad mr. dracula?  I'm not sure that qualifies as a fetish. <br/> 
Put another way, sex when you are depressed is no where near as good as sex when you laugh about your depression.

      I'm sorry, but it looks like a puppet to me.  I realise that it's computer generated...but I can't stop seeing it as a marionette.

      this is something i have thought a lot about. let's discuss. <br/> 
Thora Birch is perfect for Molly, but for Beef, i was thinking somebody younger and more soft-spoken.... Zach Galifianaki, maybe Zach Braff, or if an animated version ends up on adult swim, i'd trust the role with Brendon Small. <br/> 
Todd - Chris Ward (mc chris. this is perhaps most basic idea.) <br/> 
Vlad - Frank Azaria (this would make the world a perfect place.) <br/> 
Lie Bot - Paul Rudd (or in my fantasy cast, Stephen Colbert if he comes back to voice acting) <br/> 
Philippe - Maria Bamford (or any number of voice actors, really.) <br/> 
Lyle - Dave Attel (my choices are somewhat obvious i suppose) <br/> 
Pat - Michael Showalter <br/> 
Cornelius, Teodor and Nice Pete could be any number of people. <br/> 
Ray Quentin Smuckles is impossible for me to cast. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm sure you guys can top that cast. I'm really interested: who would you trust the voice acting for each character with?

      I would die a little if you used Zach Braff. I think he's really annoying. Brendon Small sounds too young, but I'm sure he can do something else... <br/>

      Oddly enough I made a list just yesterday. I posted it somewhere else here (2005, I think), so I won't be surprised if this is lamed as a re-run to anyone who saw it there. Anyway: <br/> 
 <br/> 
As uncomfortable as I have always been with the thought of an animated Achewood ( <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145057/https://youtube.com/watch?v=nH432AFoDU8">those things never turn out right</a> ), this is a fun game and, in spite of myself, I've definitely spent some time thinking about it. Some of these ideas were mentioned by others at various points - if I could remember who said what I'd credit them. Here are the possibilities that I (and they) have considered: <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Beef</strong>  - Crispin Glover <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Cornelius</strong>  - Michael Gambon (please everybody, stop this Kelsey Grammer nonsense. The man's got no class.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Teodor</strong>  - John Cusack (I understand that Teodor's Belarusian and Cusack isn't, but I know a few people of Russian decent who've lived in the states their entire life and who, unlike their parents, speak perfect American English, so this doesn't feel far-fetched to me). <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Molly</strong>  -  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145057/https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/theoffice/characters/profile_dawn.shtml">Lucy Davis</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Ray</strong>  -  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009145057/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_3000">Andre Benjamin</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Lyle</strong>  - Benicio Del Toro (I realize that Lyle isn't Hispanic, but I think he could bring a lot of life to the part. Think Fear and Loathing. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Philippe</strong>  - An actual child. By "actual," I guess I mean "not necessarily an actor." Think Charlie Brown Christmas. Like that.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Pat</strong>  - David Hyde Pierce <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <strong>Lie Bot</strong>  - Christopher Walken ( <em>perfect!</em>  thank you, riazm) <br/> <br/> <br/> Again, let me stress that I do not wish for this to happen. But if it had to, this, in my mind would be pretty ideal.   <br/>

      Well thought out, sir. I do have a bit of an issue with Crispin Glover in  <em>any</em>  role these days. The guy's a loony. Have you seen "What Is It?" Good Lord. There are no words, just soft, padded walls. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, I haven't seen enough of Andre 3000's acting to fully endorse this. He's got the persona, but does he have the chops? <br/>

An aside - I re-watched "Traffic" the other night. Benicio Del Toro can do fucking  <em>anything</em> .

Besides, Gary is slowly but surely gettin' up there in years, and by the time any animated Achewood project came to fruition he'd proably be just old enough to pass, with some makeup.

Ted Lange, or Isaac the Bartender as Ray Smuckles <br/> 
Ian McKellen as Cornelius Bear (Classy, and can pull off some hardcore Shakespearean rage when Cornelius gets a fake tattoo/finds out that Phillipe is participating in E-buggery) <br/> 
Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, or Andre Benjamin as Roast Beef (The dudes can bring on the sass) <br/>

      Interesting. Teodor was really the most difficult pick. I was also kind of leaning toward Adrien Brody, for whatever reason. It would have to be someone with character, but not too over the top. Not cartoony. That would be my worry with Patton Oswalt. John Goodman would be interesting as Ray, but in the end I just cannot hear Ray with a white voice. Just doesn't work for me.

      The international press dubbed her "the most beautiful Weisn waitress" at Oktoberfest 2000, and her face got plastered all over the news outlets. She still works it, but now in a more celebrity fashion, acting as MC and singing with the crowd, etc. As of last year, she's getting a music career going, apparently as a singer. Her family has a big resort hotel in Austria, and she is still in the family business, having studied tourist management at Johannes-Kepler University. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In future news, she will separate from her husband of 3 years and wed a handsome American artist who has a penchant for arch webcomics and beer. <br/>

      I had a Teodor moment at the polling place today.  The woman in line in front of me had black-dyed and bleached hair and a stud in her lower lip.  All punk rock but politically aware enough to vote in a primary.  When she asked for the ballot, she had an exotic first name, something like "Azerbaijan".  I imagined us discussing redistricting over Jack and Cokes between sets at the local club where she knows the drummer who's playing in 3 out of the 4 bands on the bill.  Then I realized there's no way I could say anything to this girl at 8AM in front of a bunch of poll workers that wouldn't make me come off as a complete weirdo, so I had to be content with us sharing a quiet bond through our wearing of "I Voted" stickers.

      This was the best idea on this page.  And that's saying something.  I haven't heard the word "chubby" used so much as on this page.  Nor have I heard so many promises of chubbies, or allusions to actual erections and erectile dysfunctions. <br/>

      I'm sorry, everyone. It's been fun, but I have to admit to you all that I do know what historical period Nazis hail from. If I accidentally led anyone to believe that I thought Hitler died in 1985, I am sorry. I thought it would be a vaguely humorous non sequitur, and I was wrong. That is all.

      Quick punctuation lesson to all: shift the apostrophe in "80's," "40's" and so on to before the number so it looks like "'80s" or "'40s." This is because you are abbreviating for the first two digits, not making it possessive. (speaking of Nazis)

      I think beneath the immediate reactions of jealousy/disgust by the sex-having, or being annoyed that he can't borrow the lamp right now, Teodor is REALLY pissed because he knows that, even after Beef and Molly are done with the lamp, he STILL won't be able to borrow it without thinking about the Dracula sex.

      To be honest, I had just learned it too and it begged use.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Other options were sesquipedalian, tautologous, and prolix.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
In listing and perhaps even using these words, I have raped them.

      Look at all us dudes hangin' out down here, at the bottom of the page.  I feel like the last stalwarts of a long and raucous party, sitting around, tired as hell, drinking what's left of the booze, all chillin' and discussin' old times.  Words slow, thoughts slow, but nothing but smiles. <br/>

It was a good party.

      I can safely say that I have been to several out of control parties, blacked out several times and never have I either experienced, or heard of someone shitting out a condom. <br/>

      I went to this party! Only it wasn't a party. It was traveling back from Tijuana. And the condom was full of Colombian white. And there were 40 of them. One, after the other, after the other.

      I wish I had the slow-day-at-work excuse. For me, it was just a terribly slow day. Full time academia makes me want to communicate my needs strictly with buzzing and dance, as the bees surely do. Someone would probably notice that.

      For me, it was the opposite of you both, somehow: <br/> 
 <br/> 
I have just finished my course, and am currently unemployed, and should be looking for more jobs right now, but instead my ADD procrastination is at full tilt and I am waiting by the phone for a call back from the people I had an interview with yesterday.  So, while I shouldn't be looking at shit I will buy with all the barrels and barrels of Nazi gold I will be paid if I do in fact get this job, here I am no less.  Plus I got hella depression last year and am still getting over it, and still don't wanna get off my ass.  That's why I really hope I get this job. <br/>

This is the point of the party where someone says something that makes everyone go quiet and kinda ruins the atmosphere.

      damn, people.  bitch about the structure of assetbar, don't bitch that too many people love achewood and want to talk about it.  what, are you surprised and angry that there 8,000 people saying things that you think are strictly self-serving and inane?  then welcome to the internet, glad you could join us! <br/> 
 <br/> 
I really think that there should be a forum structure that allows everyone to have their witty say in a completely strip-specific way while not just bloating the page completely beyond usability, but I'm not sure what that would look like.  maybe have the chubbiest comments/threads float to the top, while collapsing the reply trees?  I just don't know.
