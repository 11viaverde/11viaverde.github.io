      Listen, dude - I can't speak for everyone here, but it seems to me that the reason the lames rain down upon you has a lot to do with your reaction to those lames. Someone might lame you just off-the-cuff, not thinking much about it one way or the other (I have done this), and that could be the end of it. But then you get all whiny and over-defensive about it. That only makes people (like me) feel better for having lamed you in the first place. Then everybody else sees what's happening and they throw theirs in, too, 'cause it really has become as lame as can be. Then you make  <em>another</em>  petulant comment and the flood gates just open wide, man. And  <em>you</em>  opened them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Or it could just be your anime avatar. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. You're avatar from a Japanese-made video game which looks exactly like anime. See, I pay attention.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Point is, take your lames like a man and think for  <em>at least</em>  a few seconds about what you're submitting. Ask yourself - Is it lame? Is it something that a child would write? Will every fake person here hate me for this?  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, you may find that if you change your avatar to a picture of someone shouting (preferably a character from this comic) you'll see a substantial increase in your amount of chubbies and maybe a corresponding decrease in your amount of lames. It won't even matter what you say, just as long as you have your caps lock on. These people eat that shit up. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'm just trying to help.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now I will take all the lames which I, myself, will justly garner from this over-long and condescending comment. I will allow them to run over me and through me, and I shall become a better fake man. This is the True Path.

      The sad thing is, George Lazenby could have had most of Moore's movies.  They brought Moore in because Lazenby, on the advice of his agent (who was convinced that a good old-fashioned chauvanist like Bond wouldn't play in the hip and forward-thinking 70's), abandoned his contract with Eon pictures. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Lazenby was in "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and is probably the 3rd best Bond ever, after Connery and Craig.

      Brosnan, I think, embodied the literary character of the sort of rough-and-tumble but classy guy that Ian Fleming wrote about. But you are right. He had the shittiest of shitty movies. (Except I have a special place in my heart for Goldeneye, which was my first experience with the Bond universe, and has colored my approach to women, fast cars, and alcohol ever since). <br/> 
 <br/> 
On a somewhat unrelated note: I was  <em>so</em>  pissed that Clive Owen was not chosen as the new Bond. However, Mr. Craig is doing a bang-up job of it, so I'm not complaining.

      I liked the Brosnan movies. I didn't expect them to be works of art, just some cool gadgets, some fights, saving the day, and that's what I got. <br/>

Go back and watch the old Bond Movies. The acting is terrible and the stunt fights, falling, etc., is ridiculous. They are still cool movies but I find it hard to understand how Bond fans can call the new ones crap. Glass houses. <br/>

      Not necessarily when it comes to cartridge-based games, my friend.  It can save on the game cartridge, a memory card (N64 only - wasn't invented by the time of the SNES and Genesis), and sometimes, on the console itself.  Depends on the game. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I, personally, bought an N64 again just for one game and one game only: WWF No Mercy. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And yes, it stomps massive ass.  No wrestling game, to this day, can compare.*  And sadly I'm not joking here. <br/>

*Def Jam: Fight For NY came pretty damned close, but arguably almost not a true wrestling game.  Still, amazingly good game.

Daniel Craig lacks finesse. The man basically just plays a thug. He is the  <em>Homo habilis</em>  of Bonds, all smacking things with chipped flint and swinging his burley arms around. He has turned James Bond from a thing that men aspire to into a thing that men evolve out of.  <br/> 
And while Casino Royale was passably entertaining... Quantum of Solace  <em>(even the title is the most pretentious drivel imaginable)</em>  was just a modern art abortion of a film. It was plotless, pointless, senseless, horrifically abstract, and by several miles the worst James Bond film ever made. EVER. When it was over, I thought I'd just watched the pre-intro to the scene and was understandably confused that the ending credits were not actually the intro credits. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Daniel Craig should step away from James Bond... permanently... and leave it in the hands of someone who actually has style.   <br/>

      I happen to LIKE Roger Moore, thank you! I hate exactly half of Brosnan's movies, and although I hate two of Moore's as well (Man With The Golden Gun and Moonraker...urgh) the ratio is still much bigger. You can't tell me Live And Let Die or For Your Eyes Only are bad movies. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Moore is third on my list (behind Dalton and Connery, IN THAT ORDER). I'm not ranking Craig until after I see Quantum of Solace.

      Yeah, that was a while ago, too. Notice, though he  <em>did</em>  paint her ass, here - he went ahead and painted two large penises on her back. Good for you, Keith! <br/>

Even though I'm into traditional oil painting, I still have good memories of Haring. I went to art school in NYC, in the late '80s to early '90's, and his stuff was still on the walls of subway stations even though he was already a huge name in the NY art scene. The Pop Shop opened up right across the street from my school, too, so I saw his stuff constantly. Simpler times, my friends.

      I disagree.  Every time I've watched an episode I get overwhelmed by shame.  Shame that this country made such an utterly disposable work of fluff, a comedy with no laughs, the #1 show for all those years.  I know teevee can't always be good, or even often be good.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
It can't all be the A-Team.  However, is it too much to ask that when it is bad that at least it be bad in an interesting way?  The victory of the lowest common demoninator that Everybody Loves Raymond demonstrates is never surprising, but endlessly shameful.

      I'm not a huge Grace Jones fan, but I'd probably have been happier if Tanya Roberts' character was bumped off in A View To A Kill. It's probably not her fault, cos she's fairly amusing as Donna's mother in That 70's Show, but all she does in AVTAK, especially the second half, exclaiming "James!" (if danger is imminent) or "Oh, James" (when he saves her, again). <br/>

      Way back in 2008, candidate Ray Smuckles promised his mother, and Achewood, that: <br/> 
 <br/> 
"You won't see me gallivanting around in no golf shirt!" <br/> 
 <br/> 
But it seems Mayor Smuckles has a little problem remembering that promise. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Kind of makes you wonder ... just what kind of cat Ray Smuckles is.  Just what other promises he intends to break in his second term. <br/> 
 <br/> 
So before you vote this November, just ask yourself: Can we trust our children's future to a man who lies to his mother about ties and combing his hair? <br/>

      After the previous strip, I was feeling very depressed about Ray's relationship with his mother. This one, however, takes the disturbing feeling I had and turns it into heartwarming compromise. Ray's mom is the bomb. <br/>

Also, A View to a Kill was pretty good, and featured a young Christopher Walken as Max Zorrin, the villain, in a wonderful performance.

      Another excellent example of avatar/message synergy!  I can totally see Sparks holding court with Marco and Stormy on the best Bond super villains. <br/>

 <em>Sure, you've got your Strombergs, your Draxes, your Kamal Khans.  They all had the required eccentricities and willingness to sacrifice subordinates and innocent life alike.  But Max Zorrin, he had the intangibles.  Like those crazy eyes that let the world know, "I'm the kind of man who booby traps equestrian courses."  That, and the fact that he was a product of Nazi genetic experiments.</em>
