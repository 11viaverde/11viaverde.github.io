      <strong>NEW THEORY</strong> <br/> 
 <br/> 
Teodor has been berating Beef's failures to be a good man to Molly at every opportunity in the past coupla months, so maybe this is where his jealousy will finally come to a head. He will look upon Beef's massive Pythons and think "How is it that this fool can type some damn greeting cards and get massive muscles but I've been exercising for all this time and can't lose pound one!?" Also, Teodor is kind of fat.

      I feel like it's Teodor as well. For what it's worth (not much) there are claws on the feet.. I don't know if the cats walk with detracted claws or not.. <br/> 
As much as it saddens me, the emotional charge of this arc is pretty commendable. I like it in a terrible way.

      No...as long as you watch programming such as [adult swim], but not for shows like Robot Chicken or Family Guy.  Also, the Discovery Channel, History Channel, and Sci Fi can be cool from time to time.  I have given up on Sci Fi because they no longer air MST3K.

      Alreadyinuse: Yes, it makes you a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925102012/https://stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com/2008/01/26/28-not-having-a-tv/">snot</a> , and the worst kind of snob at that - one whose snobbery is based on completely facile and unjustified assumptions. So you don't even get to claim the title of snob, really. Anyway, from your previous posts you've generally proven yourself to be out of touch with reality and kind of naively proud of this because you seem to think the whole rest of humanity is made up of 'idiots who support George Bush'. If that makes life easier for you, sure, why not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Steev_dayv: After Futurama and possibly Harvey Birdman, Family Guy is the most clever cartoon on television. I will argue this to the death against the people who have lazily decided not to like it because a) South Park (which is third-grade level shit about half the time) told them to, or b) because frat guys happen to also like it for entirely different reasons.

All I'm saying is that from your various posts you come off as a guy who sits in his living room wearing a collander on his head and shouting at the upholstery while smearing himself with turkey gizzards, and thus may lack the adequate information or perspective to make judgments on the relative value of cultural phenomena.

      Yea, this is exactly what I'm talking about. It doesn't matter how much you've traveled, you're obviously sheltered by the confines of your own somewhat warped (as you admit) mind. And you're wrong, wrong, oh so wrong. Yes, I'm in grad school, and unlike you I find almost everyone here to be pretty much on the same level as me. I have no idea on what basis you could possibly conclude the opposite unless you're just drawing your speculations out of thin air. Your reasoning is completely self-absorbed and circular. You've withdrawn into your own mind and you create justification for this by deciding that everyone around you is stupid and that their engagement with social reality and the surrounding culture makes them stupid. And then you argue that they're stupid on this very basis. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The very fact that you dismiss everyone here in the same breath as George Bush and rednecks shows both how absolutely deluded you are (I doubt there's a single person on this board who supports him) and a certain degree of paranoid obsession, since you bust this out as some general proof of your superiority even when the argument has nothing to do with it. Hating Bush is neither something to be particularly proud of nor something that puts you above others when you're in  a social circle where it's pretty much taken as a given. Not to mention that your political arguments come across as naive and simplistic, since you seem to just be parroting the whole meme of Bush = Redneck = Fundamentalist. I mean do you even consider the influence of the PNAC or AIPAC? Do you know where the neoconservative movement originates? You're not that enlightened, trust me. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, if you think the majority of users here are 'ghetto', why do you insist on sticking around? I think I've been more tolerant of you than others (perhaps too much so) because you sometimes say something witty or insightful when you're not being deliberately obnoxious, but lately the ratio's been pretty low. I'm very sorry that your lack of a fixed upbringing seems to have caused you to become self-absorbed and unbalanced, but this board is not a psychiatric outlet. And if you think everyone here is beneath you, then why not leave? It doesn't matter to me one way or another, but I think by now a majority of users would be happy if you did.

      I heard it attributed to Phillip K Dick, and heard it as 99%.  Perhaps PKD was more discriminating.  My life experience would lead me to conclude that 99% is far closer to the real ratio, as applied to anything worthy of conversation.

      Why you lazy ass.  A simple Google search would reveal: <br/> 
 <br/> 
Sturgeon's Law is the name given to two different adages derived from quotes by science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon. The first is "Nothing is always absolutely so", while the second, and more famous, of these adages is: "Ninety percent of everything is crap." Sturgeon himself commented that Sturgeon's Law was originally "Nothing is always absolutely so"; the second adage was originally known as Sturgeon's Revelation. However, almost all modern uses of the term Sturgeon's Law actually refer to the second adage, including the definition currently listed in the Oxford English Dictionary.

      I disagree with your general assertion on Family Guy, however, and I don't draw my dislike of it currently from what another animator told me to like nor am I racist against fratboys. <br/> 
 <br/> 
What is the non-sequitor?  What is its purpose?  In the past, the non-sequitor was used to cast aspersions on whatever was already being discussed -- either to distract the flow of thought away from the subject or to bring to the fore something horizontally related the subject that would not have been brought to attention otherwise; this is so whether this was the intended purpose of the non-sequitor or not. <br/> 
 <br/> 
One can agree that the humor of Family Guy is an ironic humor: a setting is presented, a familiar trope is presented, a character behaves with or without cultural references (usually with) to a situation in an unexpected manner, i.e., it is ironic that the character under the circumstances and within the expectations proffered by the setting should behave or reference as he does or what he does.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
But while, I feel, Family Guy was an exemplar of ironic culture, it was operating on an intellectually - I won%u2019t say higher but perhaps more aware level than what was more common around it.  However, irony for its own sake has fallen by the wayside in the six years since Family Guy first aired, and it%u2019s a bit tacky now; ironic t-shirts are the domain of hipsters and were always a bit tacky, now it is my opinion that they are moreso, displaying and advertising a proudness of how much the wearer %u201Cgets it.%u201D  Even in the hyper-referentiallity of the post-modernists this was seen as somewhat tacky. <br/> 
 <br/> 
And this is where Family Guy finds itself today: in the arena of the post-ironic. However, since it never genuinely relied on joke writing or plot development but rather the juxtaposition of the expected and unexpected, it now relies on presenting the viewer with the unexpected contrasted against the unexpected of the unexpected. In other words, it%u2019s a series of non sequitors without purpose; a rolodex of referentiallity without any mooring to reference.  If that%u2019s what you find funny or entertaining, that%u2019s fine, but to me it%u2019s sophomoric, bland, and frustrating.  It%u2019s lazy writing.  It%u2019s pulling plot points out of a hat, filling all spaces with irrelevant or otherwise nonsensical pop cultural references (and the references are now purely pop-cultural rather than how it behaved before with self-created or obscure references that stood on their own; to do that now would constitute effort) filled with stock dialog from either earlier episodes or other sitcoms (another layer of pointless referentiallity) and calling it finished.  It can%u2019t even be labeled absurd because it%u2019s so clearly trying to pander to a particular mainstream body. Lazy writers writing for a largely lazy audience.

      I think it's telling that people haven't watched much of Family Guy when all they can find to criticize is the familiar trope of the random cutaway scenes. But if you watched it consistently you would find that it's the content, not the format, that makes it funny. Both inside the cutaway scenes and within the course of the 'normal' plot, what I enjoy Family Guy is its incisive skewering of little everyday annoyances and common mannerisms (like the cell phone conversation Stewie overhears in the elevator), the same way a lot of other adult swim shows focus on the awkwardness of banal everyday dialogue exchanges (there was a recent episode with Brendan Small where they did this really well).  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway, your argument seems to be more that Family Guy isn't as good as it used to be than that it sucks overall, which I might agree with if I hadn't missed most of the last couple of seasons. But no one uses the same argument to say that the Simpsons sucks in general, although there have been many points where they've reached a level of suck far below the worst Family Guy episode. I agree that pop culture references  are generally fairly cheap, but they don't necessarily break a show, and they're not the only ones that Family Guy makes. How many people do you think even got the reference when Stewie said to Meg "somewhere in an attic, there's a picture of you getting prettier"? I wouldn't call that mainstream pandering. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Overall, I think people tend to underappreciate fast-paced shows like Family Guy and Drawn Together where a lot of jokes and references go by without stopping to care whether you've gotten them or not, unlike South Park, which will hammer the same joke into your head for half an hour. If it's not your cup of tea, that's fine, I'm just asking people to trust me on the fact that there are smart people who like Family Guy, and they have good reasons for it (unlike otherwise smart people who like American Idol and such). <br/> 
 <br/> 
Robot Chicken is still pretty retarded 95% of the time though.

      I think I basically more lie with the opinion that the cutaways are time killers, once at least with the sense of relevancy, now blatantly just because the plots are so tenuous and unimaginative that they are basically admitting they have ten minute of plot they need to stretch out to 23 or however long half hour shows are without commercials.  Drawn Together I can at least admire in this respect because the cutaways are always cuts to actual jokes as opposed to random pop cultural reference A enmeshed with random pop cultural reference B.  And Simpsons does suffer the same trappings of too many non sequitors, but even those are integrated within the plot rather than laughed at stonedly and never mentioned again.  In the Simpsons' case, it's a matter of bored writers instead of lazy writers. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I had watched it consistently, and the content was funny.  But once all superficial content had been plumbed, the writers appeared to resort to this padding nonsense rather than figuring out a way to keep it funny, which to me is lazy. Whatever humor there may or may not be in newer episodes is lost to me completely amongst the nonsense.  You will see that I support the earlier format, but the new format highlights the superficiality of much of the earlier cut-scenes. <br/> 
 <br/> 
It's not so much the pace of the show (which I absolutely disagree that it's fast), but, as I said, the request that we accept that the bulk of the show as is -- that is, the cut-scenes -- is irony, drawn from irony, for irony's sake.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
I know smart people who like Family Guy, I'm just not one of them.

You're kinda complaining that it has no friggin plot, eh?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
What you describe reminds me of radio.  Radio used to have character.  DJs used to have personalities.  Then the corporations discovered that you could replace quality content with a content generating formula, and while the result was not as good, it's quality level was certainly more reliable.  (reliably mediocre.) and as long as people watched or listened to it, then awesome.  The ability to better fine tune the formula to target specific demographics:  even more awesome.  Much easier to make money off of, and more money at that, than when you have a small handful of authors of quality content whose appeal varies from day to day and who appeal to complex demographics and who try to negotiate bigger and bigger contracts and who can take their tradecraft to the competition.  If a family guy writer quits, they'll replace him or her.  No problem.

      Well, I find the show decently funny, although certainly formulaic, and at times (usually once or  <br/> 
twice on a good episode) completely, belly laugh  <br/> 
hilarious.  What sucks is when they do one of those  <br/> 
bits where the joke is that the joke is unfunny and  <br/> 
overly long and the audience has to sit through it.   <br/> 
Family Guy is just a mixed bag of jokes and gags that  <br/> 
run the gamut from awful to great on a shoestring of a plot and I'm one of the people that can dismiss their inner culturally high-minded critic and enjoy the show as just that.  It doesn't hurt being one of the apparently few people on the internet that can laugh at sterotypical humor without caring how the humor affects the already fucked minds of people who joined a club that made them drink the sludgy run-off of beer, vomit and piss accumulated in the basement of the frat house. <br/>

      Sci-Fi is such a major fall from potential.  They had a show they aired maybe every three months for a year, it was hosted by Charles Band and they aired really terrible horror movies, but it was all in fun. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now, all they do in terms of horror is their own incredibly terrible and not-intended-as-so Original Films.  I'm not a huge science fiction television fan, but from what I can tell, it doesn't even provide there, either. <br/> 
 <br/> 
They should really consider just changing their line-up to MST3K and Twilight Zone.  Don't even get me started on Chiller.  Chiller is the biggest sham I've ever witnessed.  Why won't a horror network ever just be  <em>good</em> ?   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Clearly I have given a lot of thought to these grievances.

      I will go to my grave defending the Sci-Fi era!  I have never met an episode of MST3K I didn't like. <br/>

As for the new Battlestar Galactica, I think it is pretty okay I mean it depends on your taste for hacky, kitschy, clunky Robbies versus inexplicably hot robots who look completely human.  I think it's a cop out.  Robots should be robots, but then aga---wait a minute <br/>

      I asked because friends of mine in college watched it so they could make fun of it. I didn't watch it as much as they did, and some of the things they found stupid I didn't really see why they were so stupid, but then again I tend to prefer anime for my sci fi fix and the last sci fi novel I actually read was  <em>Ender's Game</em> , so basically I'm just soliciting opinions. <br/>

      My first inclination, condescending as it is, is to say that you haven't seen enough of the Comedy Central-era episodes.  But maybe you have, and you just like 'em all.  <em>I don't get that, but okay</em> . <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's a handful of good Sci Fi Channel eps, in my opinion, but overall, they're just dead, dead boring.  So many painfully boring movies that don't seem to enliven the crew at all, so many long breaks with no riffs, etc.  Not too mention the host segments mostly sucking. <br/> 
 <br/> 
My favorite season: Season 6.  But that may be because it has my two favorite episodes: Skydivers and Starfighters.

      I never managed to see Fugitive Alien 2, I think it was one of those ones, that for some reason or another,  CC had already stopped showing by '94. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I'll always argue that Manos, while a good episode and one of the worst movies they ever did, and, for obvious reasons a bit of a flagship episode, is overrated.  There's a lot of dead spots in that episode, where they tend to just let the awfuleness of the movie carry itself, while they sit around, in stunned silence; but that wears thin on repeated viewings, I think. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Also, while a truly horrible movie, I've always thought they've seen worse.  Manos was practically a home movie, a one-off oddball pipe dream of some TX entrepreneur, if I recall correctly.  I've always thought Monster-a-Go-Go or the Coleman Francis movies (Red Zone Cuba, Beast of Yucca Flats especially) to be much worse.  I think Kevin Murphy said in that episode guide book that Monster-A-Go-Go is "officially the worst movie we've ever done."  But the Coleman Francis movies, man...what makes them so bad is not merely their complete ineptness and incomprehensibility ("A flag on the moon...how did it get there?", the Bay of Pigs invasion being about 15 guys trained only on how to climb slight inclines via a rope), but the fact that Francis apparently had enough motivation and "creative" drive to come up with (at least)  <em>three</em>  fucking movies from his seemingly sociopathic brain.  Not too mention getting funding for them. <br/> 
 <br/> 
He's like the sullen, "why won't they take me seriously" Emilio Estevez to Ed Wood, Jr.'s affable, devil-may-care Charlie Sheen <br/> 
 <br/> 
HOLY MOTHER OF PUSSY I'm turning into alreadyinuse or achilleselbow or something.  Sorry, just killing time before lunch, and I haven't rambled on about MST3K in almost a decade. <br/>

      I agree with you on Manos--It put me to sleep once.  I include for it's badness, like I might include "Philippe is standing on it" because of it's simplicity. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Fugitive Alien 2 was bad enough to make Servo's head explode. Love that. <br/> 
I don't remember if I've seen the Coleman Francis films--I'll have to see if I can find copies of those.  I remember Sandy Frank sucked hard.

      He's got a point.  Discovery, Learning Channel...do they show anything besides home improvement shows now?  And History Channel, despite the occasional bright spot, is basically the Edward Hermann Voice-over Network, with a stock cast of about 20 local theatre geeks in chain mail pretending to fight each other next to the soccer fields at the middle school.  (The key to a History Channel documentary: close angles, shakey camera work but NO lateral movements, please!  We do not want the Cracker Barrel in the shot.)

      I don't know--For that to be Showbiz, it would hinge on a couple coincidences, or on Showbiz suddenly getting his shit together: <br/> 
 <br/> 
1-Showbiz would have to coincidentally be in the same hotel (or the plane, or at least the airport). If it was  <em>intentional</em> , then he must have been stalking Beef from the start, (maybe even set up the Stewardess) (or  <em><strong>is</strong></em>  the Stewardess). <br/> 
 <br/> 
B-Showbiz suddenly had shit together enough to work all this out/know about Beef's fame. (Though I supposed it's plausible that an accomplished mooch would smell cash rolling in from miles away.) <br/> 
 <br/> 
There's a window of possibility there, but I think that window is filled with a Ray of hope.  (possibly cut up by a helicopter)

      Greeting someone with "what's up" is the speech pattern of Showbiz.  the other characters rarely if ever employ that as a greeting.  "new money" betrays what is majorly on the mind of the speaker.  If it were Ray, or Tedor, they would be more worried about some other subject, like the question of the cheating on Molly.  If they were going to say something 'clever' they would say something along that line. <br/> 
 <br/> 
As for Showbiz, he's a professional leech.  His own brother strikes it rich...  Of course he's going to be there.  If he doesn't have the cash to bankroll being there, he will find underworld venture capital to make it happen, or he will scam Molly for the cash or information he needs, or whatever it takes.  He will be there.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
Showbiz doesn't even have to have pictures, he just has to make Beef think he has pictures. <br/> 
 <br/> 
That's kind of an odd hotel room... the mattress is on the floor and the lamp table is no higher than the mattress.

      ouff.. I read your reply nabeel84 and I still didn't get it.  I thought you were referring to panel 10, which didn't make any sense, because as clearly depicted in panel 9, Beef had already fallen asleep in the hotel room, so in panel 10 he was now waking up from a mad night of who knows what with union curves. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I didn't notice the completely different decor and such between panel 9 and the other panels.  <br/>

That casts this strip in a whole different light.

      I vote for it being Showbiz.  That looks like something he's wear.  He most likely heard about the card gig from Beefs little radio blurb and, being the sort who would associate with a seedy crowd, had no trouble finding a transvestite flight attendant who was game for a blackmail gig.

      Although I have no doubt the Galveston Giant has an epic story worthy of the best director, I have for many years wanted to write the quintessential  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925102012/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L._Sullivan">John L.

      I thought it was  <em>alright</em> . <br/> 
I hoped to myself that it was made without any knowledge of Napoleon Dynamite. Otherwise it is both  <em>alright</em>  and  <em>hugely plagiaristic</em> . <br/>

      So I know this is a little late but I have to get this out.  Aperson: You are WRONG.  I cannot fathom why anyone would truly think Eagle vs Shark is "plagiaristic", let alone " <em>hugely plagiaristic</em> " of Napoleon Dynamite, unless it is the fact that both movies feature socially awkward characters, and you believe that no movies made after Napoleon Dynamite are allowed to feature socially awkward characters.  The characters in Eagle vs Shark are not awkward teens in Idaho struggling through the crucible of high school, still forging their own identities,  and sweetly stumbling into new experiences of friendship and burgeoning romance.  No.  They are socially  <em>crippled[/] and severely damaged [i]adults</em>  in a film that is totally different in both feel and subject--that is merely where the differences  <strong>begin</strong> .  I encourage everyone see Eagle vs Shark and discover for yourself how desperately wrong aperson is. <br/> 
 <br/> 
By the way, aperson--is that avatar still Winslet, or has she matured into Kim Cattrall?

Peter Jackson's early work particularly  <em>Heavenly Creatures</em>  <everyone else will tell you about the splatter flicks which  <em>are</em>  great. <br/> 
 <br/> 
 <em>This Quiet Earth</em> , a strange last man on earth film with NZ greatest actor Bruno Lawrence pointing a gun at a statue of Jesus in achurch and demanding God show himself "or the kid gets it". <br/> 
 <br/> 
And my personal favorite  <em>Goodbye Pork Pie</em>  a bit of an acquired taste but the best film to feature a stunt driving mini since  <em>The Italian Job</em>  <the one with Benny Hill not the remake.

      This is not really a discussion to have here. Yes, about half their strips are lame and predictable in the way that you have pointed out. The others are good for Tycho's awesome command of the English language, and also for non-sequiturs. I could find better examples, but I'm not invested enough in this conversation, so here: <br/>

      I didn't know there were people who disliked Penny Arcade to this extent. This is a revelation to me. <br/>

I enjoy words. I enjoy people who are good with words. As such, I very much enjoy Penny Arcade and the accompanying posts, even on days when I could care less about the video game they are reviewing (which in all honesty is most days) because I enjoy the intelligent use of words  <em>that much</em> .

      I dunno man sorry to rag on you for three posts in a row but these two strips don't demonstrate any character developemnt nor the ability to draw anything beyond cliche bored, sarcastic, or sardonic facial expressions to match the canned humor.  It's a step above common canned comic strip humor, but only a step.  Instead of being a repeating cliche about social situations or gender roles a-la-Blondie or some such, this instead seems to hinge on predictable language puns and linguistic imagery.  Which is less predictable than the common comic strip, but is still a canned formula.  There is much better stuff out there to read.  This looks like something one reads because it's there, like an ad in the metro.

      Obviously there's better stuff to read out there, but as Sir Phillip Sidney said, it's somewhat strange to argue that "good is not good because better is better". I don't necessarily need MORE fictional characters in my life to care about every little aspect of and have to read about even when the strip itself is not funny so I don't lose the storyline. I never said Penny Arcade was brilliant, but it's definitely better than the dude above me gives it credit for. It's at least mildly funny on a more than occasional basis, and it has good insights on the gaming world and industry, which I suppose wouldn't matter to people who parrot the "pop culture rots your brain" line.

      whoa whoa whoa I am not against pop culture like some sort of Diesel Sweetie's Indie Rock Pete.  I am just against the pop culture that sucks, which is a lot of it, but not all of it of course.  Hell just to cite a random factoid, before WWII it was common for factory workers in Germany to read classical literature, so, I mean, it was popular, but it was still good.  So I'm down with that. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Anyway.  Personally, from the strips presented here, I don't really dig Penny Arcade, but then again, my personal sense of taste is a little eccentric to say the least, so maybe I shouldn't jump into the middle of such a question. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I dunno... it could be funny... But I guess here we are trying to come up with an objective defintion for what is funny, or what is 'good art.'  Perhaps we're all being snobs. <br/> 
 <br/> 
But you know one cartoon I really can't stand is  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090925102012/https://octopuspie.com/">https://octopuspie.com</a> <br/> 
 <br/> 
I don't know if I can quanitfy this or argue this from an objective and metrologicalable standpoint, but damn, the characters in OP just seem sooooo self-absorbed... both in the dialogue and just in the facial expressions they have. <br/> 
 <br/> 
The other kind of cartoon I hate is generally any sort of cartoon of the style that typically is used for religiously themed cartoons, like the classic Jack Chick cartoons, etc.  Of course I resent the content of these cartoons as they are generaly advancing some sort of extremeist fundamentalist wacko brand of culture.  But that's not what I consider to be their most damaging aspect...  The most demented aspect of these cartoons is the facial expressions and the body language of the characters.  It's like, when people are brought up in some sort of brain-washed cult, you can see it in their facial expressions and their body language.  Facial expressions and body language express a lot about who we are, and a lot of religious culture like any good cult culture winds up being all about exorcising the soul of the individual.  So naturally, they express this in their idealized cartoon depictions of people. <br/> <br/> <br/>

      I love Penny Arcade, but I'm a gamer chick.  I recognize my unobjectivity in that.  I agree, some people don't get the funny because they're not in the gamer world and lifestyle, or if they are, they're not intelligent enough to get the background game stuff, or aren't interested in reading about it.   <br/> 
 <br/> 
And let me add momentarily.. the top strip was Wednesday's strip (the most recent) He didn't have to go far to find the funny.  <br/> 
 <br/> 
Otherwise.. I'm staying the hell out of it.  I'm sure this post will get lamed like all hell.  Kudos to you Achilles.. keep up the good fight.

      All of a sudden I'm tempted to post Achewood comics where the punchline is 'dongs' or 'hella dongs'. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Thanks for taking 20 minutes out of your life to make a post about why you hate Penny Arcade. I look at your profile and youve made between 70-80 comments? With about 7 or 8 aimed just at me. I'm happy I have such a huge impact on you. <br/> 
 <br/> 
If you don't like it good, I don't care. It doesn't change how I feel about it. <br/>

Now would you please move on, you're holding up the goddamn lunchline.

      Just as an additional also guy with the green avatar, I find Adult Swim to be asinine, juvenile trash. But I don't have the energy nor patience to construct a 20 minute presentation on its faults and foibles. I didn't even want to mention that I dislike it, because it's irrelevant if you like it. But, y'know, if you're going to push the issue constantly..

      I was thinking it's Molly but I have trouble believing she'd be that intimidating about it. Although maybe it's just a Beef's-point-of-view sort of skew on how intimidating she SEEMS.

      Okay, I just have to say that every time I see your avaton I think of the book "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly" (don't know if it's in the movie) where the author wakes up after his massive stroke to find them assuming he is a vegetable and sewing his eyelids shut. <br/>

      I can relate.  When I was a kid I met the teenaged daughter of one of my mom's friends named Heidi.  I thought she was pretty awesome so soon  <em>I</em>  insisted on being called Heidi also.  This went fine until my grandma pointed out that Santa wouldn't be bringing any presents for Heidi, only Rachel.  I guess she didn't take kindly to a weirdo little grandkid changing her name!

      I think the ae spelling is biblical, from the Hebrew or some such.  A few odd spellings like that work that way.  My wife is named Rebekah (not Ms. Higgs, though her bosons are nice), and got endless crap for not being Rebecca, despite the kah spelling being more historically correct.

      Yes of course, but there IS a standardized conversion between Hebrew spelling and English, and converting the Hebrew Rivkah, wife of Isaac, into English, gives you Rebekah.

      I still fail to see any normative force in this. If you want to transliterate Hebrew consistently, because you do it all the time, go for it. If you want to transliterate any which way you feel like, that's cool too.

      There isn't really one standardized form of transliteration. That's why you can spell "Hanukkah" like seven different ways.  <br/>

There may be fairly standardized conversion of names the same way Juan is converted to John or whatever, but the spelling is still totally up in the air.

      This is pretty much true.  Biblical lexical transforms (I don't use transliteration here because I am in a different field) are fairly standard (at least Protestant ones).  However, as you mention, there isn't a sanctioned standard as with Pinyin or Koine Greek.  So, in essence, I agree that arguing about it is dumb. <br/> 
 <br/> 
In general, we've wander a long way from relevance, and into some rather hostile waters, so I'll sail back a ways and say that I think the sandal belongs to Ray, and that Rachel is a pretty name, regardless of spelling.

      Well, ya got a bonus chubby because I meant to hit reply... but here's an explanation. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Beef lays down to "Make himself comfortable" in the tramps room... as he lays, he thinks of the bed that he would normally sleep on, namely, the bed with Molly in it.  So then he freaks out, realizes that he's in a trashy ho's room, and jets out of there before she leaves the bathroom.

      So that's what Molly looks like with her back turned? I thought it looked like Nice Pete from behind, but that seemed like kind of a weird thing to pop into Beef's head.  Then again, weird and Beef aren't mutually exclusive.

      Okay, I've read guesses that the sandaled foot belongs to: <br/> 
1. Ray <br/> 
2. Showbiz <br/> 
3. Teodor <br/> 
4. Molly <br/> 
5. The stew's pimp <br/> 
6. Some "Butter" guy <br/> 
7. Rod Huggins <br/> 
8. Anyone else I missed. <br/> 
 <br/> 
Union Curves is out, she couldn't have been in the bathroom and the outside hall at the same time.  Ray is possible, but the sandals are wrong.  Not Molly, she wouldn't say "new money."  The other are absurd guesses. <br/> 
 <br/> 
I think it is a female cat's leg, and she will be a new character.

      It's come to my attention that no one has mentioned Pat.  It seems likely, that in his newfound gayness, he may wear such sandals.. he's likely to be a dick to Beef.. and we haven't seen him in a while.  So.. another theory.

      Yeah, that is the clear implication, what with the sandals and hennessy and "new money" line. It is possible that it could turn out to be someone else, but there is no evidence for that whatsoever (and it would mean Onstad is deliberately misleading us...which seems unlikely in this particular situation). Still, people love their conspiracy theories so... ITS LIE-BOT WITH A FAKE CAT LEG!
